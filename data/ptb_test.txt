Frank Lloyd Wright is reported *-1 to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in California.
We've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California's vitality, but maybe the state's la - la factions are starting *-2 to overwhelm the forces that *T*-1 made it such a significant place.
What else is one *PRO*-1 to make *T*-2 of the whacky *PRO* save - the - earth initiative just proposed * by several major environmental groups and organized * by the state's attorney general?
If *PRO*-2 passed *-1 by the voters, the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, ban new offshore drilling, ban chemicals thought *PRO* to deplete the ozone layer, and create a new state environmental officer armed * with a $40 million *U* budget 0 *PRO* to sue any firm or agency 0 he thinks 0 *T*-4 is being too dirty *T*-3.
The initiative is based *-1 largely on the wish - lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.
Interestingly, the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with this one.
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed.
The initiative bars the sale of any crops *ICH*-2 in California that *T*-1 don't meet the initiative's standards.
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have *-1 to adjust or give up the California market.
In other words, California is presuming *PRO*-1 to take control of the nation's farm policy.
As usual the green lobby's proposal is disconnected *-1 from scientific reality.
*PRO* Consider the greenhouse - effect provision.
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory, it *EXP*-1 is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what *T*-3 is billed *-2 as a global problem.
But if rational science and economics have nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 with the new environment initiative, what *T*-1 is going on?
The first place 0 *PRO* to look *T*-1 under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit *T*-2.
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
He's running for governor.
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who *T*-2 collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative 0 *T*-3 to be placed *-1 on the ballot for election on Nov. 6, 1990.
That's also the day of the gubernatorial election.
The initiative seems *-3 to have been crafted *-4 *PRO*-5 to include all the hot issues that *T*-1 set off the wealthy Hollywood weepers who *T*-2 donate money.
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits.
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits *T*-1) is gravy.
This initiative is being labeled *-1 *PRO*-3 The Big Green, but maybe it should be called *-2 *PRO*-4 The Big Greenback.
(The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, *PRO*-1 sponsoring his own crime initiative.)
While it *ICH*-3 is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled *PRO*-5 unconstitutional, it *EXP*-4 is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.
This is the state that *T*-1 recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative.
If this new proposal ever does become law, the green lobby will benefit directly.
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer 0 *T*-3 to sue companies or government agencies that *T*-1 do things 0 he doesn't like *T*-2.
That means 0 the NRDC and such groups no longer would have *-1 to spend as much money on litigation; taxpayers would bear the cost.
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple - pie issue *ICH*-1 among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.
Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves.
George Bush, for example, may decide that he doesn't want *PRO*-2 to be the President who *T*-1 lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California.
And some other segments of California's political and media culture may yet start *-1 to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs.
This grandiose initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still tethered * to economic and scientific reality, or as one being led * to wherever its la - la activists want *PRO*-2 to take it *T*-1.
The sudden "flight to quality" that *T*-2 triggered Friday's explosive bond - market rally was reversed *-1 yesterday in a "flight from quality" rout.
The setback, in which Treasury bond prices plummeted *T*-1, reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit - taking.
"It was a pretty wild day.
Our markets were closely tied *-1 to the stock market," said *T*-4 Joel Kazis, manager of trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
"Friday's flight to quality was no longer needed *-2 once the stock market found its legs," he said *T*-3.
Some fixed - income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday.
That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high - quality Treasury bonds, which *T*-1 are safer than other types of securities.
But when stocks began *-2 to climb instead *T*-1, prices of Treasury bonds declined.
Contributing to the selling pressure were *T*-2 dispatches by several investment firms advising clients *PRO*-1 to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios.
Among the firms were *T*-1 Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
The bond market seemed *-1 to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by *PRO*-2 allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1/2%.
The closely watched rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, slid to about 8 3/4% last week, down from its perceived target level of about 9%.
The rate is considered *-1 an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
Traders said 0 yesterday's modest easing didn't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected *-1.
In fact, some economists contend that the latest easing started last week.
Others note that some investors were disappointed *-1 because they had expected a more aggressive easing.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond, ended about 1 3/4 points lower, or down about $17.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The reversal was even more evident among shorter - term Treasury securities.
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as 0.70 percentage point on Friday, they gave back three - fourths of that amount yesterday.
The bond - equivalent yield on three - month Treasury bills, for example, was quoted *-1 late yesterday at 7.72%, compared with 7.16% Friday.
Investment - grade corporate bonds, mortgage - backed securities and municipal bonds also fell.
But prices of junk bonds, which *T*-2 were battered *-1 Friday in near standstill trading, rebounded *PRO*-3 to post small gains after a volatile trading session.
Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed.
Some traders said 0 the high - yield market was helped *-1 by active institutional buying.
In particular, they said 0 *?*, firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began *-2 making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels *T*-3.
"I think 0 the willingness *ICH*-1 of securities companies *PRO* to make markets for high - yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds," said *T*-2 John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan, which *T*-1 opened at about 7:30 p.m. EDT.
The benchmark 30 - year bond, for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick 600 - point drop in the Tokyo stock market.
But as Japanese stocks rebounded, Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher.
Many U.S. trading operations, wanting *PRO* to keep a watchful eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin *T*-2, were fully staffed *-1 during the Tokyo trading session.
"Most of the action was during the night session," said *T*-1 Michael Moore, trading manager at Continental Bank.
Jay Goldinger, who *T*-1 often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif., said 0 trading in Tokyo was "very active" but highly volatile.
"We went down 3/4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch, then after lunch we went up 3/4 point in 12 minutes," he said *T*-1.
In Tokyo, trading is halted *-1 during lunchtime.
Tokyo's market turned out *-1 to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading.
When the market opened here *T*-1, bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength.
The bond market's focus on stock activity was so strong *ICH*-2 yesterday that it overshadowed today's slate of economic data, which *T*-1 includes the government's report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production.
Industrial production is expected *-1 to have declined 0.2%, according to a consensus of economists surveyed * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
The August trade deficit is expected *-1 to have widened to $9.1 billion *U* from $7.58 billion *U* in July.
A widening of that magnitude, said 0 *?* one New York trader, is "not a favorable number....
It could do damage to us."
Meanwhile, agency supply is expected *-1 to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $2.3 billion *U* offering of one - year, three - year, five - year and 10 - year maturities *T*-2.
Tomorrow, the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue, which *T*-1 is expected *-2 to total between $4 billion and $6 billion *U* and carry a maturity greater than 20 years.
Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp., the new federal agency created * *PRO*-1 to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts.
And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans *PRO*-1 to price a $3 billion *U* offering, its first public debt borrowing in 15 years.
"There's lots of supply," the New York trader said *T*-1.
"We have a couple or three tough weeks coming."
Treasury Securities
Prices of Treasury bonds tumbled in moderate to active trading.
The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted *-1 late at a price of 101 19/32, compared with a closing price of 103 12/32 Friday.
The yield on the benchmark issue rose to 7.97% from 7.82%.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 late at 100 3/32 for a yield of 7.97%, compared with 101 9/32 0 *PRO* to yield 7.84% *T*-2.
Short - term interest rates fell yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction.
The average discount rate on new three - month Treasury bills was 7.37%, the lowest since the average of 7.36% at the auction on Oct. 17, 1988.
The average discount rate was 7.42% on new six - month bills, the lowest since the average of 7.35% at the auction on July 31, 1989.
Here are *T*-1 auction details:
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360 - day year, while the coupon - equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365 - day year.
Both issues are dated *-1 Oct. 19.
The 13 - week bills mature Jan. 18, 1990, and the 26 - week bills mature April 19, 1990.
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporate bonds ended one to 1 1/2 point lower.
There were no new issues.
Foreign Bonds
Foreign bonds surged as the dollar weakened against most major currencies.
Among benchmark issues:--Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers screens at 96.15, up 1.17 point.
The yield was 5.245%.
-- West Germany's 6 3/4% issue due June 1999 ended at 98.30, up 0.91 point *PRO*-1 to yield 6.99%.
-- Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/8 higher at 111 19/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.12%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 rose 21/32 to 98 26/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 12.74%.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities gave up most of Friday's gains as active issues ended 24/32 to 30/32 point lower.
Dealers said 0 morning activity was hectic as prices dropped in response to gains in the stock market and losses in Treasury securities, but trading slowed to moderate levels in the afternoon.
Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted *-1 late yesterday at 98 4/32, down 30/32 from Friday; 9 1/2% securities were down 27/32 at 100 5/32; and 10% securities were at 102 2/32, off 24/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 1/4, down 3/4.
On Friday, mortgage issues gained as much as 1 5/32.
Late yesterday Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.39% to a 12 - year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.42.
Traders said 0 there were some busy dealings in Freddie Mac and Federal National Mortgage Association securities because underwriters from last week's heavy slate of real estate mortgage investment conduit issues moved *PRO*-1 to gather collateral for new deals.
Offsetting the Remic - related purchases were *T*-2 continued heavy sales by mortgage originators, which *T*-1 are producing increased amounts of fixed - rate mortgage - backed issues with lower rates.
There was no new - issue activity in the derivative market.
Municipals
Rebounding stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1/4 to 3/4 point lower in late dealings.
The session losses left municipal dollar bonds *PRO*-2 close to where they were before the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally *T*-1.
Trading was hectic during the morning, with players trying *PRO*-1 to gauge whether equities would continue Friday's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness.
Tax - exempts started the session *PRO*-1 flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion, but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash wasn't at hand.
Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session.
Traders said 0 retail investors seemed *-1 to be hugging the sidelines until a measure of volatility is wrung out of the market.
New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 3/4 at 98 1/2 bid, *PRO*-1 yielding 7.32%, up 0.07 percentage point from late Friday.
Florida Board of Education's 7 1/4% issue of 2023 was 5/8 point weaker at 99 1/2 bid.
The 7 1/8% issue of Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority of New York, due 2019, was off 5/8 at 98 1/8 bid.
And Fairfax County, Va., Water Authority's 7 1/4% issue of 2027 was down 3/4 at 99 7/8 bid.
Serial bond yields were up about 0.05 percentage point.
You know what the law of averages is *T*-1, don't you *?*?
It's what 1) *T*-3 explains why we are like, well, ourselves rather than Bo Jackson *T*-4; 2) *T*-3 cautions that it *EXP*-1's possible *PRO* to drown in a lake that *T*-2 averages two feet deep; and 3) *T*-3 predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed * before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes.
Baseball, that game of the long haul, is the quintessential sport of the mean, and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.
The team that *T*-2 dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held *-1 to just one in two games by the home - team Oakland A's, the gang that *T*-3 had been done unto *-4 similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year's tournament.
Morever, much of the damage was accomplished *-1 by A's who *T*-2 had some catching up 0 *PRO* to do *T*-3.
In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done *-1 by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.
He hit a 2 - 0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left - field stands in inning four *PRO*-2 to stretch his team's lead from 2 - 1 to a decisive 5 - 1, where it stayed *T*-1.
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular - season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup.
"If you get your pitch, and take a good swing, anything can happen," he later remarked *T*-1.
On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes *PRO*-1 to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.
Mark McGwire, the big, red - haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits *ICH*-3 in four at bats, two more than he'd had *?* in the five - game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1 - for - 17 *T*-2.
The A - men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5 - 0 decision.
Right - hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits *PRO*-1 to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.
That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21 - 9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates 0 he may have some evening up coming, but with the way 0 his split - fingered fastball is behaving *T*-1, that might not be this week.
The same goes for Mike Moore, another veteran who *T*-1 overcame early struggles *PRO*-2 to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest.
"Every guy 0 they put *T*-1 out there had a better split - finger than the guy before," marveled *T*-2 Giant manager Roger Craig.
He's an ex-hurler who *T*-1's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which *T*-2 looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat.
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best - of - seven fest.
The stat 0 *PRO* to reckon with *T*-2 here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that *T*-1 took 2 - 0 Series leads went on *PRO*-3 to win it all.
That's not an average 0 *T*-1 to soothe Giant rooters.
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called *PRO* *PRO*-1 BART (that's a better name for a public conveyance than "Desire," don't you think?) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings, but they observe them in relative calm.
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000 - plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see.
A few folks even showed up *PRO*-1 wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams.
"I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.
I love 'em both.
The only thing 0 I'm rooting for *T*-1 is for the Series to go seven games," said *T*-2 David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go.
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.
I choose *PRO*-1 to believe 0 it's the latter, although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.
*PRO* Suffice it *PRO* to say that if this were a New York Yankees - Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat *PRO* to separate opposing fans, and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets.
Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes 0 *PRO* to root for *T*-1.
In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy - looking, second - year shortstop who *T*-1 had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery.
He was flawless afield (ditto in game two), moved a runner along in the A's three - run second inning, and homered for his team's final tally.
Such *ICH*-2 is *T*-5 his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season *T*-3, the fan who *T*-1 caught it agreed *PRO*-4 to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph.
Not his autograph; power - hitter McGwire's.
An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who *T*-1 exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation.
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by *PRO*-1 going 3 - for - 3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run.
"When you're in the groove *T*-1, you see every ball tremendously," he lectured *T*-2.
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark, Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams, the Giants' 3-4-5 hitters.
They combined for 25 hits, six home runs and 24 runs batted in * in the five games against the Cubs.
They went a collective 5 - for - 24 here, with zero homers and ribbies.
It's that last set of numbers, as much as anything else, that *T*-1 gives the Giants hope in the Series games 0 *T*-2 to come.
"I believe in the law of averages," declared *T*-1 San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two.
"I'd rather *ICH*-3 see a so - so hitter who *T*-1's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who *T*-2's cold."
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side *T*-1.
"When it goes *T*-1, you never know when you'll get it back *T*-2," he said *T*-3.
"That's baseball.
BSN S.A., a leading French food group, said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Birkel G.m.b . H., a West German pasta maker.
The value of the acquisition wasn't disclosed *-1.
The move is in line with BSN's strategy of *PRO* gradually building its share of the European pasta market through external growth.
BSN will initially acquire a 15% interest in Birkel, a closely held concern.
The French group has an agreement giving it the right *PRO* to buy all the shares outstanding, and this could be completed *-1 within a few months, a BSN spokeswoman said 0 *T*-2.
The takeover was submitted *-1 for approval by the West German cartel office, BSN said 0 *T*-2.
Birkel is West Germany's second - biggest producer of pasta, with sales of 250 million marks ($133.4 million *U*) in 1988.
It has 750 workers at three production units in southwest Germany, and is that nation's leading producer of pasta sauces.
The acquisition strengthens BSN's position in the European pasta market.
The French group currently ranks second after Barilla Group of Italy, whose sales *T*-1 are chiefly in the Italian market.
Ambassador Paul Nitze's statement (Notable & Quotable, Sept. 20), "If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that *T*-1 has one chance in a million of *PRO* going wrong will go wrong at least once a year," is a pretty negative way of *PRO* looking at things.
Isn't it *EXP*-1 just as fair *PRO* to say that if you have a million people working for you, every good thing that *T*-2 has one chance in a million of *PRO* going right will go right at least once a year?
*PRO* Don't be such a pessimist, Mr. Ambassador.

Chicago investor William Farley agreed *PRO*-1 to sell three divisions of Cluett Peabody & Co. for about $600 million *U* to Bidermann S.A., a closely held clothing maker based * in Paris.
Shortly after *PRO*-1 completing the $1.56 billion *U* acquisition of West Point - Pepperell Inc. in April, Mr. Farley's holding company, Farley Inc., said 0 it was considering the sale of Cluett, a leading shirt maker and one of West Point - Pepperell's biggest units.
Included *-5 in the sale are *T*-4 Cluett units that *T*-1 make men's shirts under the Arrow name, socks under the Gold Toe name and menswear through the Schoeneman division.
The companies said 0 the agreement is subject to Bidermann's receipt of financing and to regulatory and other approvals.
They said 0 the sale is expected *-2 to be concluded *-1 by the end of November.
Mr. Farley said 0 the sale of three of Cluett's four main divisions plus other "anticipated" West Point - Pepperell asset sales by December, should bring in a total of about $700 million *U*.
He didn't elaborate on other asset sales being considered *.
Mr. Farley followed a similar pattern when he acquired Northwest Industries Inc. and then sold much of its assets *T*-1.
But he kept Fruit of the Loom Inc., the underwear maker that he still controls *T*-1 and serves *T*-1 as chairman and chief executive.
Cluett was an independent company until West Point - Pepperell acquired it for $375 million *U* in cash and stock in 1986.
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Cluett had operating profit of $37 million *U* on sales of $757 million *U*.
Bidermann sells clothes under various labels, including Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Robinson for men and Ralph Lauren for women.
A spokesman said 0 the company had sales of $400 million *U* in 1988.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, West Point - Pepperell fell 25 cents to $53.875 *U*.
Whirlpool Corp., Benton Harbor, Mich., said 0 it has developed a process *PRO* to recover environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that *T*-1 previously entered the atmosphere during in - home repair of refrigerators and freezers.
The maker of home appliances said 0 the process, which *T*-1 involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs 0 *T*-2 to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center, is already in use at a number of its service centers, and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring.
Earlier repairs vented the CFCs out of the home through a hose directly into the atmosphere.
CFCs are widely used *-1 as solvents, coolants and fire suppressants.
But their use has been linked *-1 to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, and a number of companies are seeking *PRO*-2 to curtail use, or at least emission, of the substance.
Whirpool said, "We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of CFC use in appliance manufacture.
Gitano Group Inc. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to buy 50% of Regatta Sport Ltd., a closely held apparel maker, with the assumption of $3 million *U* of contingent debt.
Under the terms of the contract, New York - based Gitano has the option *PRO* to acquire the remaining 50% of Regatta, a maker of men's and women's clothes sold * primarily in department stores, under certain conditions.
That 50% is now held *-1 by Clifford Parker, Regatta's president and chief executive officer, who *T*-2 will continue *-3 to manage Regatta's operations under Gitano.
In 1989, Regatta will have sales "in excess of $10 million *U*" and will show a profit, Mr. Parker said 0 *T*-1.
Gitano, which *T*-1 makes budget - priced apparel sold * mainly through mass merchandisers like K mart and Wal - Mart, said 0 the Regatta acquisition will enhance its strategy *PRO* to expand into department stores.
This fall, Gitano began *-1 manufacturing moderately priced clothes aimed * at department stores under the Gloria Vanderbilt trademark, which Gitano recently acquired *T*-2.
What *T*-1 happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated *-2 *PRO*-3 to handle another meltdown in prices.
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from *PRO*-1 suffering a panic wave of selling.
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency.
After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it *EXP*-1 would be wise *PRO* to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose *T*-2.
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers *PRO*-1 to enter the market at indicated new price levels.
It *EXP*-2 is impossible *PRO* to know whether that theory is realistic.
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from *PRO*-1 feeding on itself.
But there is also the possibility that *PRO* shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices.
What *T*-1 happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index.
Options markets stopped trading in many securities.
The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open.
With nowhere else 0 *PRO* to go *T*-1, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.
As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply.
Had the futures and options markets been open, additional liquidity would have been provided *-1 and the decline, most probably, would have been less intense.
At 3:30, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington, the futures exchanges reopened.
Futures trading, however, was halted *-1 altogether at 3:45, after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points, which *T*-2 is the daily limit for price declines.
At this point, the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled *-2 by the New York Stock Exchange.
It is time 0 *PRO* to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange, the futures markets and the options markets, though physically separate, have actually become so closely intertwined *-2 as *PRO*-3 to constitute one market effectively *T*-1.
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them.
It *EXP*-1 therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers.
*PRO* To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none.
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions.
It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for *PRO* halting trading or staying open.
*PRO* Let's not have one market shut *-2 down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points *T*-1 and another shut *-3 down for an hour after a 250 - point decline.
The need for hurried last - minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules *ICH*-1 are in place that *T*-2 synchronize circuit breakers in all markets.
The new circuit breakers, if they are *PRO* to be applied *-1 at all, will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open.
The rules should be established *-3 by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight *RNR*-2 and with the approval *RNR*-2 of the government regulatory agencies.
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (which, with the SEC, *T*-2 regulates the Chicago stock - index markets) be unable *PRO*-3 to agree, the issue may have *-4 to be resolved *-1 by decision of the Treasury secretary.
In many ways, our financial markets are better prepared *ICH*-2 *ICH*-3 today *PRO*-1 to handle a decline than they were *?* two years ago.
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity *PRO* to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day.
Telephone service *ICH*-3 has been improved *-4 for customers trying *PRO* to reach their brokers, and specialists--who I believe 0 *T*-1 should stay, despite the urgings of some post-crash critics--have larger capital positions.
(Of course, specialists' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices.
*PRO* Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders.)
But the task of *PRO* improving market performance remains unfinished.
Mr. Freund, former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange, is a professor of economics at Pace University's business school in New York.
Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to purchase the Electro - Optics Technology division of Perkin - Elmer Corp.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed *-1.
But for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988, the most recent period for which results were broken *-1 out *T*-2, the Perkin - Elmer unit accounted for more than half the $145 million *U* in sales recorded * by the company's government systems sector.
Perkin - Elmer, which *T*-2 is based *-1 in Norwalk, Conn., said 0 the sale of the Danbury, Conn., unit is consistent with its restructuring strategy announced * in April.
In addition to *PRO* making electro - optical systems, the unit also makes laser warning receivers.
These are used *-1 aboard military helicopters *PRO*-3 to warn pilots that a laser weapon has been focused *-2 on them.
Hughes of Los Angeles said 0 the PerkinElmer unit's work complements efforts by its Electro - Optical and Data Systems group, which *T*-1 makes infrared sensors, military lasers and night vision equipment.
Hughes said 0 it expects the sale to close by year end.
Nintendo Co., a Japanese maker of video games, electronic information systems and playing cards, posted a 23% unconsolidated surge in pretax profit to 61.41 billion yen ($429 million *U*) from 50 billion yen ($349.9 million *U*) for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31.
Sales surged 40% to 250.17 billion yen from 178.61 billion.
Net income rose 11% to 29.62 billion yen from 26.68 billion.
Pershare net fell to 423.3 yen from 457.7 yen because of expenses and capital adjustments.
Without *PRO*-1 detailing specific product breakdowns, Nintendo credited its bullish upsurge in sales--including advanced computer games and television entertainment systems--to surging "leisure - oriented" sales in foreign markets.
Export sales for leisure items alone, for instance, totaled 184.74 billion yen in the 12 months, up from 106.06 billion in the previous fiscal year.
Domestic leisure sales, however, were lower.
United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC, a British food producer, announced the creation of a European group 0 *T*-1 to bring together its trading interests in the region.
The new group will comprise all of United Biscuit's manufacturing and marketing operations in the food sector apart from those based * in the U.S. .
United Biscuits said 0 the combined group, which *T*-1 will include businesses such as McVities biscuits and Terry's confectionery, will have annual sales of more than #1.5 billion *U* ($2.35 billion *U*) and trading profit of more than #160 million *U* ($251 million *U*).
"The new structure will enable United Biscuits *PRO*-2 to focus clearly upon opportunities for planned growth during the 1990s," said *T*-1 Bob Clarke, deputy chairman and group chief executive.
Last month, United Biscuits agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its entire restaurant operations to Grand Metropolitan PLC for #180 million *U*.
Seafirst Corp. said 0 it signed an agreement *ICH*-1 with builder Martin Selig *PRO* to purchase its headquarters building, the Columbia Seafirst Center, for $354 million *U*.
Purchase of the 76 - story structure is subject to execution of a definitive agreement, approval by the boards of Seafirst and its parent company BankAmerica Corp., and approval by regulators.
British retail sales volume rose a provisional 0.4% in September from August and was up 2.2% from September 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry said 0 *T*-1.
For the three months ended in September, retail sales volume was down 0.5% from the previous three months and up 1.2% from a year earlier.
First, there was a death watch.
Then exhilaration.
*PRO*-1 Spurred *-2 by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday's 190.58 - point plunge, *PRO*-1 gaining 88.12 to 2657.38.
It was the fourth - biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips, on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares--the highest since the days after the 1987 crash.
While the advance cheered investors who *T*-1 feared 0 a 1987 - style crash would occur yesterday, it was strictly a big - stock rally fed * by huge buying by bargain - hunting institutions and program traders.
A troubling sign: Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers, 975 to 749, and the over - the - counter market that *T*-1 includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday's late Big Board plunge.
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down 6.31 to 460.98.
Meanwhile, in a divergence in two of the market's most important indicators, the Dow industrials' sister average, the 20 - stock Dow Jones Transportation Average, tumbled 102.06 to 1304.23--its second - worst decline next to the 164.78 - point fall during the 1987 crash.
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks, UAL and AMR, which *T*-2 each fell more than 20% when they reopened for trading yesterday after *PRO*-4 being suspended *-1 Friday afternoon *T*-3.
UAL, the takeover stock at the center of Friday's 190.58 - point market plunge, fell 56 7/8 to 222 7/8 on nearly 2.3 million shares.
Overall, "this is a pleasant rally but it's very selective," said 0 *T*-1 Arthur Cashin Jr., a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board.
"Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure *ICH*-1 of the OTC market *PRO* to get into plus territory.
It's just a strange feeling.
I don't think 0 anyone left the place *PRO*-1 whistling Dixie."
The rally gave credence, at least for now, to the pre-trading declaration *ICH*-1 of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday's market debacle was "an abnormal condition, and not a disaster."
But to traders, it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 1.64 shortly after 9:30.
But most of the 30 blue - chip stocks in the average, including Eastman Kodak and General Motors, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left * over from Friday's late - afternoon rout.
At 9:45, Procter & Gamble--one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late--opened down 2 3/4 to 117.
The Dow dropped to a quick 27 - point loss, and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed *-1 for yet another big tumble.
More stocks opened over the ensuing half hour, as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of *PRO* keeping the market *PRO*-3 orderly groped *PRO*-1 to find buy orders from major brokerage firms 0 *T*-2 to match the selling flood.
Then, *PRO* to make matters worse, computerized sell programs kicked in, *PRO*-1 hammering stocks into steeper losses.
There was heavy stock - index arbitrage, as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures *PRO*-1 to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets.
This was a hangover from Friday, when Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks *T*-1.
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized.
They didn't *?*.
The Dow accelerated its slide, *PRO*-1 losing 63.52 in the first 40 minutes of trading.
With program traders seemingly in charge, buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall.
Then at 10:15 the Dow suddenly started *-1 to rebound, and when it shot upward *T*-2 it did so even faster than the early - morning fall.
And this time, it wasn't just the program traders who *T*-1 were responsible.
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started *-1 buying stocks heavily.
The program traders were in there, too, of course.
But according to one trader, the programmers "didn't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was {also} a lot of bargain - hunting" by institutions.
Roland M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment, which *T*-1 oversees $29 billion *U* in investments, said 0 the "first thing 0 we did *T*-2 was *PRO* to double our orders" yesterday morning.
"With the market down like this, we'll probably take another $50 million *U* and put it in" the market.
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders' eyes.
According to Big Board officials, Disney had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday; it was one of the seven stocks that *T*-1 couldn't finish trading that day.
The stock opened late at 114 1/2, down 8 1/2.
But then it shot upward 7 1/2 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought, traders said 0 *T*-1.
However, Disney specialist Robert Fagenson said: "I would be surprised *-1 if Goldman represented 4% of the opening volume."
Around Wall Street, trading desks were relieved *-1 that they could at least play the market yesterday, in contrast to Friday's gridlock.
At Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., head equity trader Dudley Eppel said: "I think 0 the opening was constructive.
It was orderly.
We put some orders together.
There wasn't a lot of panic selling, either domestically or internationally....
Not like Friday where they just took {the market} apart *T*-1."
Still, the market hadn't yet crossed into positive territory, and traders were glum.
But in another dramatic burst, the Dow tacked on 42 points in five minutes, and at 10:25 the index showed a gain of 5.74.
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks, traders yelped their approval.
Grinned *ICH*-1 Griffith Peck, a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s OTC department: "I tell you, 0 this market acts *PRO*-2 healthy."
Around him, scores of traders seemed *-1 to get a burst of energy; their boss broke out bottles of Perrier water *PRO*-2 to cool them off.
Among Big Board specialists, the cry was "*PRO* Pull your offers"--*PRO* meaning that specialists soon expected *-1 to get higher prices for their shares.
"It was bedlam on the upside," said *T*-1 one Big Board specialist.
But not everybody was making money.
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted *-1 Friday.
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came *T*-2 they were frozen *-1 with huge losses.
Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers *PRO*-1 to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning.
"They were absolutely killed *-2, slaughtered *-2," said *T*-1 one Chicago - based options trader.
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index, whose 20 stocks *T*-1 mimic the Dow industrials, didn't lead yesterday's big rally.
James Gallagher, a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau, said, "The difference between today and two years ago"--"Terrible Tuesday," Oct. 20, 1987--"is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index, spend $2 million *U* and get the program rally started *-1.
This time {institutions} saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away.
Then when the market was at a technical level 0 *PRO* to buy *T*-1 *T*-2, they came in with a vengeance."
However, according to one analyst, the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday.
"Futures were pulling the stock market higher," said *T*-1 Donald Selkin, head of stock - index futures research at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc.
Although the Big Board's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session, their performance yesterday was better than during Friday's late - afternoon chaos, according to traders and brokers who *T*-1 work with them.
Specialists were criticized *-1 for their inability *PRO* to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge.
But yesterday, even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as Merck, "we expected (the halts) and it wasn't too bad," said 0 *T*-2 Donaldson's Mr. Eppel, who *T*-1 had been critical of the specialists' performance on Friday.
According to a Big Board official, while many stocks opened late, there were subsequent trading halts in only three issues--AMR, Merck and Valero Energy.
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index.
No sector of the market has been spared *-1 during the past two days' gyrations.
Yet from the Dow industrials' high on Oct. 9 through Friday's plunge, relatively good performances have been turned *-1 in by real - estate, utilities, precious metals and life insurance stocks.
And yesterday, the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues.
For example, Halliburton jumped 3 1/4 to 38, Schlumberger rose 2 1/2 to 43 1/4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1/8 to 22.
Because of the UAL and AMR tumbles, airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday.
Philip Morris was the Big Board's most active issue, *PRO*-1 rising 2 1/4 to 43 1/4 on nearly eight million shares.
Among other major issues, Coca - Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares.
Shares of International Business Machines, which *T*-1 reported earnings yesterday, finished at 103, up 1, after *PRO*-2 slipping below 100 during Friday's session for the first time in five years.
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings.
Merrill Lynch added 1 3/4 to 28, PaineWebber rose 3/4 to 18 1/2 and Bear Stearns rose 3/8 to 14 1/4.
Federal National Mortgage Association, a recently hot stock, climbed 4 to 124 on nearly 1.6 million shares.
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday, the Big Board's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel.
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies weren't responsible for *PRO*-1 triggering Friday's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in recent months.
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded * in the final 90 minutes of Friday's session, when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated *-1 *T*-2, were program - related, he said 0 *T*-3.
Program trades make up 10% of the exchange's volume on an average day, but despite the increase Friday, it was "certainly not something 0 you would say 0 *T*-1 precipitated the market decline," Mr. Phelan said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday.
"Obviously, every time 0 we get this kind of reaction *T*-2, it's going *-3 to make everybody *ICH*-1 nervous, including me," he said *T*-4.
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that "all the participants behaved very, very responsibly today."
Meanwhile, Peter DaPuzzo, Shearson's head of retail equity trading, praised institutional investors in the OTC market, who *T*-1 were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors.
"The institutions can't be criticized *-1 for their behavior," Mr. DaPuzzo said *T*-2 in an interview.
"It was the opposite of what *T*-1 happened on Oct. 19.
They used their judgment.
They didn't panic during the first round of selling this morning.
Instead, they bought on weakness and sold into the strength, which *T*-1 kept the market *PRO*-2 orderly.
Maybe they learned from experience."
Mr. Phelan said 0 the performance of specialists during Friday's plunge was admirable, because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded * during the day only seven *T*-1 were closed *-2 and weren't reopened *-2 before the close.
"They did an excellent job," Mr. Phelan said *T*-1 of the specialists.
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading suspensions.
James A. White and Sonja Steptoe contributed to this article.
The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that *T*-1 would give the transportation secretary authority *PRO* to review and approve leveraged buy - outs of major U.S. airlines.
The collapsed plan *PRO* to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced * Wednesday and approved * by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.
The bill is expected *-2 to be taken *-3 up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow, and a floor vote by next week will be urged *-1.
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump, who *T*-1 yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines.
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar (D., Minn.), Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort *PRO* to thwart his bid for AMR, and said 0 it contributed to the collapse of the deal.
Elaine Chao, deputy transportation secretary, also sent a letter 0 *T*-1 to express the administration's opposition to the bill "in its present form."
Rep. Oberstar brushed off Mr. Trump's allegations as an "excuse for his own deal failing."
He also said 0 the fact that the other letter hadn't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated 0 there is "wiggle room" in the administration's position.
Mr. Oberstar and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation wasn't a response to any particular market situation.
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons *PRO* to move quickly *PRO*-1 to enact this legislation.
Aides both in the House and Senate said 0 the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR isn't likely *-1 to deflate efforts *PRO* to push the legislation.
"It's still on the fast track and we still want *PRO*-1 to do it," said *T*-2 one Senate aide.
The bill is aimed *-1 at *PRO* addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures *PRO*-2 to pay off the debt incurred * in a leveraged buy - out.
Currently, the transportation secretary doesn't have clearly established authority to block mergers, but can take the drastic step of *PRO* revoking the operating certificate of any carrier 0 the official considers *T*-1 unfit.
Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort *PRO* to add stability and certainty to the airline - acquisition process, and *PRO* to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry.
In general, the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30 - day review period before 15% or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired *-1.
It also would require the acquiring party *PRO*-1 to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to *PRO* determining the intent of the acquisition.
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy - out if sufficient information hasn't been provided *-1, or if the buy - out is likely *-2 to weaken the carrier financially, result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets, or give control to a foreign interest.
If more information is needed *-1, the secretary would have authority *PRO* to extend the review period 20 days.
All the witnesses, both congressmen and industry experts, expressed support for the bill in order *PRO* to prevent profiteers from *PRO*-1 cashing in on airline profits at the expense of safe, cost - effective service.
But several committee members disapproved, some backing Mr. Trump's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock - market plunge.
One of the major concerns expressed * by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited *-1 from *PRO*-2 divesting themselves of smaller entities and producing independent spin - off companies.
A House - Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the continental U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii.
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic, and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.
The exemption allowed * on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears *-2 to be largely a face - saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which *T*-1 has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years.
By a 6 - 4 margin, House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights.
But the six - hour compromise was soon agreed to *-1 in subsequent discussions.
As a practical matter, flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered *-1 as they are under the time limit, but the language would exempt longer routes beginning, for example, in Chicago or on the East Coast.
Within the Senate, the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), who *T*-1 has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman *PRO*-2 to garner votes for the initiative.
The measure is attached *-1 to the more than $26 billion *U* fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg's jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced *-2 with more than $205 million *U* in road projects earmarked * by members as well as funds sought * by major airports, including Denver.
From the outset, the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy *PRO* to follow *T*-1.
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states, such as North Carolina.
Majority Whip William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House, and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference *PRO*-1 to salvage the exemption from a total ban.
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest, the underlying bill was the subject of behind - the - scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane, but politically important, projects of members.
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees, the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed * by lawmakers in Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania who *T*-1 had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor.
"Anybody can vote as they want *?*," said *T*-1 Rep. William Lehman (D., Fla.), head of the House conferees.
"But if you make a request, you should support the committee."
Within the Federal Aviation Administration, the final bill promises *PRO*-1 to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20% from last year, and total operations would rise to $3.84 billion *U*--a 12% boost.
The facilities account includes $40 million *U* for Denver's ambitious new airport, and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver, United and Continental.
*PRO*-1 Leery of the costs--and, critics say, competition--the airlines have sought *PRO*-1 to gain leverage over the city of Denver.
Texas Air Corp., which *T*-1 owns Continental, and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying.
The industry sought *PRO*-2 to impose conditions that *T*-1 would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50% of the gates.
But this was rejected *-2 in favor of much looser language directing the Transportation Department *PRO*-1 to review the costs of the first phase, expected *PRO* to cost about $2 billion *U*.
Though smaller in total dollars, the conference agreed *PRO*-1 to preserve an estimated $30.6 million *U* in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports.
The sum is more than double what the House had approved *T*-2 for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut *-1 by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy.
Congress previously cut six airports this year.
The impact of the changes is *PRO* to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 *U* for each passenger in subsidies *T*-1.
Among rail and highway accounts, the agreement provides $615 million *U* for Amtrak, including $85 million *U* for capital improvements.
And federal - formula grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen *-1 at $1.625 billion *U*, or $20 million more *U* than last fiscal year.
Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning, with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points *PRO*-1 to close the morning session at 35087.38.
The index slid 647.33 points, or 1.8%, on Monday.
In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday's trading the Nikkei index soared 664.83 points, to 35133.83.
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time, the index was up 435.11 points, to 34903.80 as investors hailed New York's overnight rally.
Monday's slide came in a relatively calm session that *T*-1 didn't provide much direction for other markets.
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe, particularly in Frankfurt, although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began *-1 to rebound in New York.
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo, but the selling wave stopped short of *PRO*-1 precipitating another market crash.
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market 0 *T*-1 to trade since Friday's 190.58 - point plunge on Wall Street.
But rather than *PRO*-1 set the tone for other markets, Japan's major institutional investors chose *PRO*-1 to remain on the sidelines.
Still, despite the sudden reappearance of stock - market turbulence, managers of Japanese investment funds said 0 they weren't planning *PRO*-1 to unload U.S. or European equities.
"We didn't trade much today, as our policy now is *PRO* to wait and see," said *T*-1 a fund manager at Taisho Life Insurance Co.
"We would like *PRO*-1 to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York."
The institutions appeared *-4 confident that Japanese regulators would step in *PRO*-2 to ensure orderly trading if necessary, and there was considerable speculation *ICH*-1 during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes *PRO*-3 to do just that.
But in the absence of panicky trading, its presence was never overtly felt *-1.
At the close, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at 34468.69, down 647.33 points, or 1.8%.
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank 45.66, or 1.7%, to 2600.88.
The day's decline was generally in line with analysts' weekend predictions.
Declining issues swamped advancers, 941 - 105.
But volume was thin at 526.2 million shares, compared with 574.7 million Friday.
The market opened sharply lower, with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes.
A midmorning rebound brought it back *PRO*-1 to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session, but the rally failed in the afternoon, and the market closed near the day's low.
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell 100.96, or 2.7%, to 3655.40.
Many investors, trying *PRO* to outperform the market's major indexes, have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks.
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market didn't fall more sharply.
But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago, during the October 1987 global stock market crash.
On Oct. 16, 1987--the Friday before the Black Monday crash--the New York market dropped 4.6%, and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4% drop.
This time, Wall Street's plunge of 6.9% Friday was followed *-1 by yesterday's 1.8% loss in Tokyo.
Two years ago, Tokyo's biggest fall came the day after New York's 22.6% Black Monday plunge, when the Nikkei average fell 14.9% *T*-1.
Thus, market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street's opening.
But in New York yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 88.12 *PRO*-1 to close at 2657.38 on heavy volume of 416,290,000 shares, although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market.
Nobuto Yasuda, a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co., called yesterday's session *PRO*-1 "a good scenario" for Japan.
"Now we are looking for the time 0 *PRO* to place buy orders *T*-1," he said *T*-2.
"For us institutional investors, the chance for buying has come."
Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co., also was optimistic.
He described Friday's plunge in the U.S. as a "fleeting" event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity.
"Unless there is a panic, this is the best time 0 *PRO* to buy *T*-1, as was the case *?* two years ago," he said *T*-2.
"Those shares which *T*-3 had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed *-1 with cold water, but as far as major stocks are concerned *-2, there isn't much impact."
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine.
"We have no plans *PRO*-2 to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities," said *T*-1 Masato Murakami, chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co.
He said 0 Friday's Wall Street decline was "well within the range of volatility" that Yasuda Trust plans for *T*-1 when it charts its overseas investment strategy *T*-2.
Among other Asian and Pacific markets, Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses, with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5% and Singapore's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10%.
Major indexes declined more than 8% in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5% in Hong Kong.
Bangkok, Manila, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses.
Brokers and fund managers said 0 the region's markets were reacting to Friday's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy - outs and a deteriorating junk - bond market.
"It's pure psychology," said *T*-1 William Au Yeung, an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert (HK) Ltd. in Hong Kong.
"Markets in this region aren't so geared *-1 to leveraged buy - outs, and their economies generally are in good shape, but there's no doubt that Asia is still following America's lead."
Several analysts said 0 Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows.
Hong Kong is the region's next most open market, but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China.
"Singapore took the hit because when people want *PRO*-2 to get out *T*-1, they tend *-3 to go where the liquidity is *T*-4," said *T*-5 Elizabeth Hambrecht, a regional analyst with Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd.
She pointed out that even after Monday's 10% decline, the Straits Times index is up 24% this year, so investors who *T*-1 bailed out generally did so profitably.
Similarly, Kuala Lumpur's composite index yesterday ended 27.5% above its 1988 close.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 *PRO*-1 to finish at 2601.70.
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares, compared with 473.9 million Friday.
But the session was orderly, in contrast to the market's four - day closure after the 1987 crash.
Richard Chenevix - Trench, a director at Hong Kong - based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd., said 0 the market probably hasn't hit bottom yet but is close.
"If New York doesn't collapse, I see maybe another 5% on the downside, *PRO* not counting the risk of bad news out of China," he said *T*-1.
In Australia, Sydney's All Ordinaries index closed at 1601.5, down 8.1%, its biggest drop since October 1987.
But volume rose only to 162 million shares from 143 million Friday.
Nestor Hinzack, an analyst at brokerage firm Burdett, Buckeridge & Young Ltd., described the market's performance as "sheep - like" as investors fled to bluechip Australian stocks and shunned entrepreneurial companies 0 they perceived *T*-1 as *PRO*-2 having any takeover premium built into the price.
London's Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index, the most closely watched market barometer, ended at its intraday high of 2163.4, down 70.5, or 3.2%.
At its low, shortly before Wall Street opened, it was off more than 130 points.
The Financial Times 30 - share index closed 79.3 points lower at 1738.7.
Volume more than doubled to 959.3 million shares from 457.7 million Friday.
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading.
The decline in the German Stock Index of 203.56 points, or 12.8%, to 1385.72 was the Frankfurt market's steepest fall ever.
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale, *PRO* pushing some blue - chip shares down as much as 20%.
Analysts cited memories of two years ago, when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued *-1 to decline steeply for the next three months *T*-2.
Here are *T*-2 price trends on the world's major stock markets, as *PRO* calculated *-1 by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
*PRO* To make them directly comparable, each index is based *-1 on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year - end.
Yesterday was, in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr., just your "reasonably normal, 400 million - share, up 88 - points day."
When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery *T*-1, Big Board officials were self - congratulatory about how well the day had gone *T*-2.
They said 0 the exchange's trading procedures, personnel, equipment and links with other exchanges couldn't have performed better.
"We had no operating problems at all," Mr. Phelan said *T*-1 after the market closed.
"All the things that we set up *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to slow down the process, to let people know that the market was in an extreme position, worked extremely well."
Prices for the 416.3 million shares that *T*-2 changed hands during the session were carried *-1 on the exchange's trading tape with barely a delay, officials said 0 *T*-3.
While *PRO*-2 reaching blockbuster proportions yesterday, the volume was still well within the 600 million - share capacity that the exchange has said 0 it can handle *T*-1 daily since *PRO*-3 beefing up its computers after the October 1987 crash.
The so - called circuit breakers devised * by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange *PRO* to quell free falls in stock and futures prices weren't triggered *-1 yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day.
Despite traders' complaints, Mr. Phelan said 0 the links with the Chicago futures market worked as *PRO* planned *-1 in Friday's rout *PRO*-2 to provide a cooling - off period.
Of greater help, the Big Board chairman said 0 *?*, was *T*-4 the "natural circuit breaker" of the weekend, that *T*-1 provided a breathing period that "*T*-2 brought rationality back to the market.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it reduced its rating on $281 million *U* of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company, to C from Ca, *PRO*-1 saying 0 it believes 0 bondholders will recover only "negligible principal."
The agency said 0 it confirmed American Continental's preferred stock rating at C.
American Continental's thrift unit, Los Angeles - based Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, is in receivership and the parent company has filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
CENTRUST SAVINGS BANK (Miami) --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded its ratings on the subordinated debt of CenTrust to Caa from B - 3.
The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long - term deposits to B - 3 from Ba - 3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa.
The rating agency said 0 about $85 million *U* in securities was affected *-1.
The downgrades were prompted *-1, Moody's said 0 *?*, by the continuing turmoil in the junk bond market and the suspension of dividends on CenTrust's preferred stock.
Moody's also said 0 it believed 0 the proposed sale of 63 CenTrust branches to Great Western Bank could, if *PRO* completed *-1, endanger the thrift's funding and market position.

What *T*-1 doesn't belong here?
A. manual typewriters, B. black - and - white snapshots, C. radio adventure shows.
If you guessed black - and - white snapshots, you're right.
After years of *PRO* fading into the background, two - tone photography is coming back.
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black - and - white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans, shoes and liquor.
Portrait studios accustomed * to *PRO* shooting only in color report a rush to black - and - white portrait orders.
And black - and - white photography classes are crowded with students.
What *T*-1's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion, home furnishings and cinematography.
On Seventh Avenue, designers have been advancing the monochrome look with clothing collections done * entirely in black and white.
And classic black - and - white movies are enjoying a comeback on videocassette tapes, spurred *, in part, by the backlash against colorization of old films.
"The pendulum is swinging back to black and white," says *T*-1 Richard DeMoulin, the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co.'s professional photography division.
Until two years ago, sales of black - and - white film had been declining steadily since the 1960s.
But last year, *PRO*-1 buoyed *-2 by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications, sales increased 5%, and they are expected *-3 to jump at least that much again this year.
Photographic companies are scrambling *PRO*-1 to tap the resurging market, *PRO*-1 reviving some black - and - white product lines and developing new ones.
At Kodak, which *T*-1 largely ignored the market for years, black - and - white film sales now account for nearly 15% of the company's $3 billion *U* in film and paper sales annually, up from 10% three years ago.
The Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant recently began *-1 marketing T - Max 3200, one of the fastest and most sensitive monochrome films.
*PRO*-1 Aimed *-3 at commercial photographers, the film can be used *-1 in very low light without *PRO* sacrificing quality, says 0 *T*-2 Donald Franz of Photofinishing Newsletter.
Also trying *PRO*-1 to snare a portion of the $2 billion - *U* a - year industry is *T*-2 Agfa Corp., a unit of Bayer AG.
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith - Joyner to endorse a new line of black - and - white paper that *T*-1's geared *-2 to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak's papers.
*PRO*-1 Slated *-3 for market by the end of the year, the paper "could have been introduced *-1 a long time ago but the market wasn't there then," says 0 *T*-2 an Agfa spokesman.
The biggest beneficiary of the black - and - white revival is likely *-1 to be International Paper Co.'s Ilford division, known * in the industry for its premium products.
Sales of Ilford's four varieties of black - and - white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market, although the company won't say by exactly how much.
"We hope 0 the trend lasts," says *T*-1 Laurie DiCara, Ilford's marketing communications director.
Why all the interest?
For baby boomers who *T*-2 grew up *PRO*-3 being photographed *-1 in color, black and white seems *-4 eye - catching and exotic.
"It has an archival, almost nostalgic quality to it," says *T*-1 Owen B. Butler, the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology.
"You can shift out of reality with black and white," he adds 0 *T*-1.
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives, who *T*-1 have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising.
Processing of black - and - white commercial film jumped 24% last year to 18.7 million rolls.
*PRO* Consider Gap Inc., whose latest ad campaign *T*-1 features black - and - white shots of Hollywood stars, artists and other well - known personalities modeling the retailer's jeans and T - shirts.
Richard Crisman, the account manager for the campaign, says 0 Gap didn't intentionally choose black and white *PRO*-1 to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors.
"We wanted *PRO*-1 to highlight the individual, not the environment," he says *?*, "and black and white allows you to do that better than color."
The campaign won a Cleo award as this year's best ad by a specialty retailer.
Even food products and automobiles, which *T*-1 have long depended on color, are making the switch.
Companies "feel 0 black and white will convey a stronger statement," says 0 *T*-2 Marc L. Hauser, a Chicago photographer who *T*-1 is working on a black - and - white print ad for Stouffer Food Corp.'s Lean Cuisine.
Other companies that *T*-1 are currently using two - tone ads include American Express Co. and Epson America Inc.
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend.
*PRO*-2 Using black and white, "we can make housewives look like stars," says 0 *T*-1 John Perrin.
His On - Broadway Photography studio in Portland, Ore., doubled its business last year and, he says 0 *?*, is booked *-1 *PRO*-2 solid for the next five.
One customer, Dayna Brunsdon, says 0 she spurned a color portrait for black and white because "it's more dramatic.
I show it to my friends, and they all say ` wow . '
It isn't ordinary like color."
Still, most consumers aren't plunking black - and - white film into their cameras *PRO*-1 to take family snapshots.
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore.
Typically, it must be mailed *-1 to a handful of processors and may take a week or more *PRO*-1 to be processed and returned *-2.
Black - and - white film costs consumers a little less than color film, and processing costs the same.
But for photofinishers, developing costs for black - and - white film are higher.
Some companies are starting *-1 to tackle that problem.
Ilford, for example, recently introduced a black - and - white film that *T*-2 can be processed *-1 quickly by color labs.
*PRO*-1 Intent on *PRO*-2 wooing customers, the company is also increasing its sponsorship of black - and - white photography classes.
Similarly, Agfa is sponsoring scores of photography contests at high schools and colleges, *PRO*-1 offering free black - and - white film and paper as prizes.
And Kodak is distributing an instructional video *ICH*-1 to processors on how *PRO* to develop its monochrome film more efficiently *T*-2.
Other companies are introducing related products.
Charles Beseler Co., a leading maker of photographic enlargers, introduced last month a complete darkroom starter kit targeted * at teen - agers who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to process their own black - and - white photographs.
The kit, which *T*-2 has a suggested retail price of $250 *U* and has already become a bestseller, was introduced *-1 after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children's photography equipment.
"It seems 0 computers as hobbies have waned," says *T*-1 Ian Brightman, Beseler's chairman and chief executive officer.
But some industry observers believe 0 the resurgence of black and white is only a fad.
They cite the emergence of still electronic photography, more newspapers turning to color on their pages and measurable improvements in the quality of color prints.
"Black and white hasn't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color," says *T*-1 Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute.
"The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago.
You can't say the same with black and white."
But when Popular Photography, a leading magazine for photographers, selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made * for its latest issue celebrating photography's 150th anniversary *T*-1, all were black and white.
"It's got a classic spirit and carries over emotionally," says *T*-1 Alfred DeBat of Professional Photographers of America.
"That's the appeal.
*PRO* Concerning your Sept. 19 article "Wall Street Firms Link Analysts' Pay to Performance," I'm delighted that Wall Street is finally tuning in to the hard, cold facts of the real working world.
If the firms are serious, however, why *PRO* limit the practice to the poor, maligned analysts whose ability *PRO* to see into the future *T*-1 is fragile at best *T*-2?
Why not *PRO* extend the same harsh standards to the sales force, and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based * on how much money they made *T*-1 for their clients during the year *T*-2?
That should stop a lot of account - churning, and produce a stock market driven * only by professional concern, careful thought and good sense.
Now, wouldn't that be a novelty.

Maxus Energy Corp., Dallas, said 0 it discovered a new oil field northeast of its previously discovered Intan Field in the southeast Sumatra area of Indonesia.
Maxus said 0 it didn't run a production test on the three discovery wells 0 it drilled *T*-2 in the field, which *T*-1 is about 1.6 miles from the Intan Field, because the wells are similar to others drilled * at its Intan and Widuri fields.
However, Maxus said 0 it believes 0 the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil.
The Intan Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the Widuri Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels.
Maxus, an independent oil and gas concern, is the operator and owns a 56% interest in the new field, called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Northeast Intan.
Other interests are owned *-1 by BP Petroleum Development (SES) Ltd., C. Itoh Energy Co. Ltd., Deminex Sumatra OEL G.m.b . H., Hispanoil (Sumatra) Production Ltd., Hudbay Oil (Indonesia) Ltd., Inpex Sumatra Co. Ltd., Lasmo Sumatra Ltd., Sunda Shell, TCR Sumat A.G. and Warrior Oil Co.

J.P. Industries Inc. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement *PRO* to sell its Builders' Hardware Group to closely held Nalcor Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1, but a J.P. Industries spokesman said 0 the amount 0 J.P. Industries will get *T*-2 for the group is "a little better than *PRO* expected *-3 by the marketplace, and the marketplace had been expecting $25 million to $30 million *U*."
The group consists of Weslock Corp. and JPI Modern Inc.
J.P. Industries, which *T*-2 is based *-1 in Ann Arbor, Mich., said 0 the sale completes a previously announced program *PRO* to divest itself of its hardware and plumbing supplies operations.
The company's remaining business is the manufacture and sale of engine and transmissions products for industrial and transportation applications.
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said 0 the first dispute - settlement panel set up under the U.S. - Canadian "free trade" agreement has ruled that Canada's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord.
Mrs. Hills said 0 the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 *-1 to resolve the dispute.
If a solution isn't reached *-1 by then, she said *?*, the U.S. would have the right *PRO* to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered * by U.S. fish - processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.
However, in Ottawa, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said 0 the dispute - settlement panel accepted the "legitimacy of Canada's position on the use *ICH*-1 of these landing requirements *PRO* to conserve and manage these important fisheries."
*PRO*-1 Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel's report, an aide for Mrs. Hills said 0 the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions "are illegal."
The U.S. trade representative declined *PRO*-1 to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions.
Canada initially had an export prohibition that *T*-3 was replaced *-1 by regulations requiring that such fish had *-4 to be brought *-2 ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export.
This action was defended *-1 by the Canadian government on conservation grounds.
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the dispute - settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument.
"We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel's ruling" that the "landing requirement" also must be ended *-1, she said 0 *T*-2.
Earlier, an international panel set * up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish - export restrictions violated GATT rules.
Mrs. Hills said 0 the U.S. won't accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. fish - processing firms enter into contracts *ICH*-1 in the fall *PRO* to purchase the next season's catch.
She said 0 the Canadian restrictions must be removed *-1 before such contracts are concluded *-2.
Steve Clark, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader, reported for work at 5 a.m., two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting.
At Jefferies & Co., J. Francis Palamara didn't reach the office until 5:30 a.m., but then he had been up most of the night at home.
"I had calls *ICH*-1 all night long from the States," he said *T*-2.
"I was woken *-1 up every hour--1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30.
People are looking for possible opportunities *PRO* to buy, but nobody wants *PRO*-1 to stick their chin out."
For many of London's securities traders, it was a day that *T*-1 started nervously in the small hours.
By lunchtime, the selling was at near - panic fever.
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street - inspired rally, the City breathed a sigh of relief.
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London's financial district.
In the wake of Wall Street's plunge last Friday, the London market was considered *-1 especially vulnerable.
And before the opening of trading here yesterday, all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a clue as to how widespread the fallout might be *T*-1.
By the time 0 trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. *T*-1, the news from Asia was in.
And it left mixed signals for London.
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less - than - alarming 1.8% on thin volume; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5% in orderly trading.
At Jefferies' trading room on Finsbury Circus, a stately circle at the edge of the financial district, desktop computer screens displayed the London market's major barometer--the Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index.
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks; blue figures, rising stocks.
Right away, the reds outnumbered the blues, 80 to 20, as the index opened at 2076.8, off 157.1 points, or 7%.
"I see concern, but I don't see any panic," said *T*-2 Mr. Palamara, a big, good - humored New York native who *T*-1 runs the 15 - trader office.
The Jefferies office, a branch of the Los Angeles - based firm, played it conservatively, *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to avoid risk.
"This is not the sort of market 0 *PRO* to have a big position in *T*-2," said *T*-3 David Smith, who *T*-1 heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks.
"We tend *-1 to run a very tight book."
Jefferies spent most of its energies in the morning *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to match buyers and sellers, and there weren't many buyers.
"All the takeover stocks--Scottish & Newcastle, B.A.T, DRG--are getting pretty well pasted *-2 this morning," Mr. Smith said *T*-1.
Seconds later, a 7,500 - share "sell" order for Scottish & Newcastle came in.
For the third time in 15 minutes, a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no - smoking area *PRO*-1 to have a cigarette.
On the screens, only two forlorn blue figures remained, but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140.
"Because Tokyo didn't collapse, *PRO* let's pick up a little stock," Mr. Smith said *T*-1.
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button *PRO*-1 to call up on his screen other dealers' price quotes.
The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at 845 pence, ($13.27 *U*) and Mr. Smith's traders started *-1 putting out feelers.
But the market sensed a serious buyer on a day dominated * by selling, and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence.
"When I want *PRO*-2 to buy *T*-1, they run from you--they keep changing their prices," Mr. Smith said *T*-3.
"It's very frustrating."
He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares.
By this time, it was 4:30 a.m. in New York, and Mr. Smith fielded a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market, which *T*-1 had been having troubles of its own even before Friday's New York market break.
"Fundamentally dangerous...," Mr. Smith said, *T*-1 almost in a whisper, ".... fundamentally weak...fairly vulnerable still...extremely dangerously poised ...
we're in for a lot of turbulence...."
He was right.
By midday, the London market was in full retreat.
"It's falling like a stone," said *T*-2 Danny Linger, a pit trader who *T*-1 was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby.
Conversation was subdued as most patrons watched the latest market statistics on television.
At 12:49 p.m., the index hit its low, 2029.7, off 204.2 points.
"France opened the limit down, off at least 10% if you could calculate the index, which you couldn't *T*-1," Mr. Clark, the Shearson trader, said *T*-2 early in the afternoon.
"Spain is down 10% and suspended *-1, Sweden's down 8%, Norway 11%.
This market has been very badly damaged *-1."
As 2:30 p.m.--Wall Street's opening time--neared, Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open *T*-2.
In the center of the trading floor, chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened--*PRO*-1 plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes.
They saw an opportunity created * by the sell - off.
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC, Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them *PRO*-1 to resell in the U.K.
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar.
Suddenly, after about 45 minutes, the U.S. markets rallied.
"The MMI has gone better," shouted *T*-1 one trader at about 3:15 London time, as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a turnabout.
As Wall Street strengthened, the London trading room went wild.
Traders shouted as their screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street.
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day.
"Rally! Rally! Rally!" shouted *T*-1 Shearson trader Andy Rosen, *PRO*-2 selling more Jaguar shares.
"This is panic buying!"
As the London market rallied, some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it.
The London index closed at 2163.4, its high for the day, off 70.5, or about 3.3%.
The market upheaval apparently hasn't triggered any cash crunch--yet.
Individual investors, investment firms and arbitragers who *T*-1 speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive *T*-2; those investors often borrow heavily *PRO*-3 to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans.
But several large banks said yesterday 0 they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that *T*-1 would signal such difficulties.
"We're seeing nothing out of the ordinary," said *T*-1 one official at a Top 10 bank.
"That's good news, because we all swim in this water."
Added *ICH*-2 another executive at a big bank: "We were all a little goosey over the weekend *PRO*-3 trying *PRO*-4 to forecast what *T*-1 would happen {Monday}, but it's been very quiet.
Now, as for tomorrow, hell, who *T*-1 knows?
BMA Corp., Kansas City, Mo., said 0 it's weighing "strategic alternatives," for its Business Men's Assurance Co. unit, and is contacting possible buyers of the life and health insurance operation.
A BMA spokesman said 0 "runaway medical costs" have made health insurance "a significant challenge," and margins also have been pinched *-1 by changes in the mix of life - insurance products 0 consumers now demand *T*-2.
The Business Men's Assurance unit represented about $288 million *U* of the company's $488 million *U* in 1988 revenue, and the unit's operating income was about $10 million *U*, said 0 *T*-1 the spokesman.
BMA's investment banker, Alex . Brown & Sons Inc., has been authorized *-1 *PRO*-2 to contact possible buyers for the unit.
Intel Corp. said 0 it reached an agreement *ICH*-1 with Alliant Computer Systems Corp. *PRO* to develop software standards for Intel's i860 microprocessor.
The i860, introduced * earlier this year, is Intel's entry in the crowded market for reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, computers.
Intel, based * in Santa Clara, Calif., is the market leader for traditional microprocessors with its 8086 family that *T*-1 forms the heart of IBM - compatible personal computers.
Under the agreement, Intel will invest $3 million *U* *PRO*-1 to acquire a 4% stake in Alliant, a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers.
Alliant, based * in Littleton, Mass., will license its parallel - computing technologies to Intel, *PRO* providing users a way 0 *PRO* to let many i860 microprocessors in a single computer work on a problem simultaneously *T*-1.
Alliant said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to use the microprocessor in future products.
It declined *PRO*-1 to discuss its plans for *PRO* upgrading its current product line.
The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke 0 T. Boone Pickens tells *T*-2 about the guy who *T*-1 was run *-3 over by the parade.
When *PRO*-3 asked "*-4 What *T*-1 went wrong *T*-2?" the unfortunate victim replied, "It was a combination of things."
And so it was *T*-1 on Gray Friday.
The grand marshal of this parade would appear *-1 to have been excess leverage.
Even if that is so, however, it *ICH*-1's probably the case that no barriers should have been erected *-2 *PRO*-3 to stop the procession before the end of the rout (e).
The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word *ICH*-2 spread that the UAL buy - out was collapsing *T*-1.
Although the union - bidder expects *PRO*-1 to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure *PRO* to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear *ICH*-2 among arbitragers that the pageant of high - leverage takeover deals is ending.
Lots of other entries *ICH*-2 made up the parade, of course--notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling Federal Reserve tightness; and the Bush administration's (temporary?) defeat in *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to lower the capital - gains tax.
As usual, few favorable reviews *ICH*-3 were heard *-1 for that ever - present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest 0 they only play the music that others write *T*-2.
What *T*-1 really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason *T*-2, the pool of debt capital is drying up.
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the "deal" stocks are jeopardized *-1 by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing.
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses.
UAL, which *T*-1 triggered the slide, opened Monday at $224 *U*, down about 20% from Thursday's close.
AMR opened Monday at $80 *U*, down nearly 20% from Thursday's close.
(Both took further hits yesterday.)
Hilton lost 20% on Friday; Paramount lost almost 11%.
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured *-1 *T*-3, the target's stock price was not affected *-2 on Friday.
The multibillion - dollar prospects, where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and / or issue billions in high - yield debt *T*-2, were where the damage was concentrated *-1 *T*-3.
The market for so - called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday's dramatic march for several weeks.
The growing financial difficulties of recent high - leverage restructurings or takeovers, such as Resorts International, Integrated Resources, and Campeau's retailing empire, have cast a pall over the entire market for high - yield securities.
Investors have reacted by *PRO*-1 ignoring recent efforts *PRO* to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by *PRO*-1 forcing Ramada *PRO*-2 to postpone indefinitely its planned junk - bond sale and restructuring.
As a result, high - yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning *PRO* to sell $11 billion *U* in junk bonds before year - end are experiencing anxious times.
These are all market excesses (*PRO* putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives *T*-1 to debt over equity), and what we've seen *T*-2 is the market reining them in.
Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency *PRO* to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that *T*-1 was at work on Friday.
If it *ICH*-1 is correct *PRO* to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday, what are *T*-2 the implications for policy makers?
After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken *PRO*-1 to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators.
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington's bashing of Wall Street *T*-1?
Absolutely not.
To the extent that Friday's sell - off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage, the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of *PRO*-1 imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior.
The national economic interests are much better served *-1 *PRO* allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings.
The recent difficulties in the junk - bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of *PRO* letting the free markets operate.
If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will *?* policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed *PRO*-1 to impose appropriate sanctions.
Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year.
Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites.
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed *-1 on Gray Friday, while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily.
If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely *PRO*-1 to come from the marketplace than from Washington.
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders, you clearly have more *PRO*-2 to fear from private investors than from regulators, although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated *-1.
The truth is, Washington understands politics better than economics.
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed *-1 too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm.
Any such attempt *PRO* to distinguish "good debt" from "bad debt," or to draw the line at a particular industry, such as the airlines, is likely *-2 to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides *T*-1 both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general.
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs, Panama and the deficit, all of them parades that *T*-1 seem *-2 never to end.
Mr. Jarrell, former top economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, teaches at the University of Rochester's Simon Business School.
In an attempt *PRO* to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency, EC government leaders are likely *-1 to agree *PRO*-2 to set a date for *PRO* starting formal talks on *PRO* amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome.
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels, most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990, and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in Strasbourg, France, on Dec. 8 and 9.
The only strong opposition to *PRO* changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who *T*-2 is opposed *-1 to *PRO* creating a single EC currency.
But the process of *PRO* convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity.
*PRO* Setting a date 0 *PRO* to start treaty negotiations *T*-1 has no legal significance in itself, but could be viewed as an important psychological push.
French President Francois Mitterrand fought *PRO*-2 to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled *-1 because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Diplomatic sources said 0 Mr. Kohl may now agree *PRO*-3 to set a date for the conference *PRO*-3 to make it *EXP*-1 clear that West Germany is still committed *-2 to EC unity.
Laidlaw Transportation Ltd. said 0 it raised its stake in ADT Ltd. of Bermuda to 29.4% from 28%.
A spokesman for Laidlaw declined *PRO*-2 to disclose the price 0 the Toronto transportation and waste services concern paid *T*-1 for the additional shares, which he said 0 *T*-3 were acquired "over the last couple of weeks."
The spokesman said 0 Laidlaw wouldn't increase its stake in ADT beyond 30% "without a great deal of thought" because of British takeover regulations that *T*-1 require a company acquiring more than 30% *PRO*-2 to extend an offer to the rest of the company's shareholders.
ADT, a security services and auctions company, trades on London's Stock Exchange.
Laidlaw is 47%-controlled by Canadian Pacific Ltd., a Montreal transportation, resources and industrial holding concern.

*PRO* CLUBBING A FAN wasn't the Baltimore Orioles' fault.
So said *T*-1 a federal judge, in a case involving two players for the minor league Bluefield, Va., Orioles, a Baltimore farm team.
The players were heckled *-1 by a patron during a July 4, 1988, game with the Martinsville Phillies.
Like its parent that year, "Bluefield was not having a good year," the judge said 0 *T*-1.
After the game ("Bluefield lost, 9 - 8, *PRO*-2 stranding three runners in...the ninth," he noted *T*-1), trouble began.
More taunting in the parking lot, the players said 0 *?*, led to a fight.
The fan said 0 he was punched and kicked *-1 by one player and that the other broke his jaw with a baseball bat.
The judge dismissed the fan's suit against the team, however, *PRO*-2 ruling the Orioles innocent of negligent hiring, and not responsible for a fight that *T*-1 was outside the players' employment.
PROPOSALS *ICH*-1 ARISE for *PRO* coping with the shortage of nurses.
An Association of Academic Health Centers report urges *PRO* freeing nurses from duties that *T*-1 don't require special skills.
It also recommends better retirement and day - care benefits, and *PRO* basing pay on education, experience and nurses' demanding work schedules.
But it opposes an American Medical Association proposal for *PRO* creating a "registered care technologist," as "potentially divisive"; it says 0 the job would entail an unwanted new doctor's "bedside" extension.

TEMPORARY WORKERS have good educations, the National Association of Temporary Services says 0 *T*-1; its survey of 2,508 such employees shows 82% with more than a high - school education, and 31% with college degrees.

HOME - SALE LOSSES rise, but they're often covered *-1 by employers.
But they search for ways 0 *PRO* to limit the damage *T*-1.
A third of 439 companies surveyed * by the Employee Relocation Council report a rise in 1988 sales losses over 1987.
About 72% reimburse for all or some losses.
Since 1984, more companies give sales - loss aid, as many real - estate values depreciated, the council says 0 *T*-1.
RJR Nabisco pays up to $30,000 *U* of losses, including improvements.

The continuing series of HUD scandals is a sadly predictable result of pork - barrel politics.
Nevertheless, lobbies such as the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) continue *-1 to pressure Capitol Hill for more special - interest spending.
Kent Colton, NAHB executive vice president, argues that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis--reduced affordability of homes for first - time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates--that *T*-1 will be "very difficult" *PRO* to solve "without expanded federal resources."
There's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending.
But the NAHB was created *-1 in 1943 out of an organization that *T*-2 made its name *PRO*-3 fighting a Roosevelt administration proposal *PRO* to take over all defense housing production.
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer's coalition, *PRO*-1 pushing for such initiatives as the balanced - budget amendment.
Yet on matters close to, er, home ...
"The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70% since 1980," argues *T*-1 Mr. Colton.
"We've taken more than our fair share.
I wouldn't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit."
But NAHB support for subsidies is not related *-1 to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set * by the federal government and has regularly advanced anti-recession housing measures.
Moreover, explains *?* one HUD official, the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that *T*-1 specialize in subsidized production.
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive wish - list, which *T*-1 would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $15 billion *U* annually.
It would like *PRO*-2 to peg the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95% of the median price in a particular market, instead of *PRO*-3 limiting it to $101,250 *U*; reduce *RNR*-1 (or even eliminate *RNR*-1) FHA down - payment requirements and increase the availability of variable - rate mortgages; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program; provide "adequate" funding for the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA); increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low - income and rental housing, including $4 billion *U* in block grants to states and localities; and "fully fund" the McKinney Act, a $656 million *U* potpourri for the homeless.
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved *-1 intolerably expensive in the past, and inevitably are twisted *-1 to the benefit of well - connected developers and lobbyists, as *PRO* demonstrated *-2 by the ongoing HUD scandal, or congressmen.
Indirect subsidies, through the FHA, for instance, are little better.
Though Mr. Colton says 0 *PRO* expanding FHA lending would result in "no cost to the government," the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low - income) to the single - family home market would result in a major expense.
More important, housing programs run * by HUD, the VA, and FmHA are awash in red ink.
The FHA alone lost $4.2 billion *U* in fiscal 1988; the government's equity in the agency, essentially its reserve fund, fell to minus $2.9 billion *U*.
The federal government has had *-1 to pump in $2.28 billion *U* into the VA housing program since 1984 *PRO*-2 to keep the fund *PRO*-3 afloat and the VA requested an additional $120 million *U* for the fiscal year just ended.
All told, the federal government already guarantees more than $900 billion *U* of mortgages.
In its nicely produced publication "Where Will Our Children Live *T*-2?" the NAHB does acknowledge that "of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided *-1 by the federal government."
It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which *T*-1 pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low - and middle - income people.
But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program--comparable to, *PRO* say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies--0 *T*-2 to eliminate counterproductive controls.
The association, a majority of whose 156,000 members *T*-1 build fewer than 25 units a year, is like many other business lobbies.
Explains *ICH*-1 Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union: "It treads in two worlds.
The builders like the subsidies, but at the same time they tend *-1 to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues, such as the balanced - budget amendment."
Unfortunately, the organization's desire for pork tends *-1 to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility.
Two years ago when the NAHB lobbied for the $19 billion *U* omnibus housing bill *T*-1, the organization "basically dropped out of the taxpayers' coalition," says 0 *T*-2 Ms. MacDonald.
As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges *T*-1: "Government is not going *-2 to solve the problem....
The real key is *PRO* to have the economy working and interest rates down."
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy; more money to municipalities that *T*-1 are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies.
Is this what the home builders want *T*-1?

For the moment, at least, euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday *PRO*-2 to close at 2657.38, panic didn't sweep the world's markets, and investors large and small seemed *-1 to accept Friday's dizzying 190 - point plunge as a sharp correction, not a calamity.
Many went bargain - hunting.
Among those sighing with relief was *T*-2 John H. Gutfreund, chairman of Salomon Brothers, who *T*-1 took to the firm's trading floor *PRO*-3 to monitor yesterday's events.
As the rally gained strength at 3:15 p.m., he smiled broadly, brandished his unlit cigar and slapped Stanley Shopkorn, his top stock trader, on the back.
At first, it seemed as if history might repeat itself.
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board, stocks of many of the nation's biggest companies couldn't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers.
By 10:10, the Dow Industrials were off 63.52 points, and the stock of UAL Corp., whose troubles *T*-1 had kicked off Friday's plunge, still hadn't opened.
But then, as quickly as the Dow had fallen, it began *-1 to turn around.
It ended with a gain of 88.12 points.
By the market's close, volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million, the fourth highest on record.
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain, in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987.
But the rally was largely confined *-3 to the blue - chip stocks, which *T*-2 had been hard hit *-1 during Friday's selling frenzy.
Overall, more Big Board stocks *ICH*-1 lost money than *PRO* gained *?*.
And many arbitragers, already reeling from Friday's collapse of the UAL deal, were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, collapsed *T*-1.
Indeed, the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged 102.06 points, its second - worst drop in history.
World - wide, trading was generally manageable.
The Frankfurt stock exchange *ICH*-2 was hardest hit *-1 of the major markets, with blue chips there falling 12.8%.
In London, a midday rally left the market's major index *PRO*-1 off 3.2%, and Tokyo's leading stock index fell only 1.8% in surprisingly lackluster trading.
Other, more thinly traded Asian markets were hit *-1 harder than Tokyo's, but there were no free - fall declines.
Investors big and small say 0 they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash: In this age of computerized trading, huge corrections or runups in a few hours' time must be expected *-1.
What *T*-1's more, such short - term cataclysms are survivable and are no cause for panic selling.
Stephen Boesel, a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, says, "There was less panic than in 1987: We had been through it once."
In Somerset, Wis., Adrian Sween, who *T*-1 owns a supplier of nursing - home equipment and isn't active in the stock market, agrees.
"I look at it as a ho - hum matter," he says *T*-1.
Many other factors played a part in yesterday's comeback.
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness *PRO* to provide liquidity; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day.
Foreign stock markets, which *T*-1 kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree, began the day off by relatively modest amounts.
The dollar, after *PRO*-1 falling sharply in overnight trading to 139.10 yen, bounced back strongly to 141.8, *PRO* thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks.
And the widely disseminated opinion among most market experts that a crash wasn't in store also helped calm investors.
Many major institutions, for example, came into work yesterday ready *PRO*-2 to buy some of the blue chips 0 they felt 0 *T*-3 had been sharply undervalued *-1 on Friday.
Still, amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday's events, some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system 0 *T*-1 to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday's.
"There is too much complacency," says *T*-1 money manager Barry Schrager.
Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world - wide, so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed *-1 around the globe.
So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday's opening in Tokyo, where the Nikkei average of 225 blue - chip stocks got off to a rocky start *T*-1.
The average plunged some 600 points, or 1.7%, in the first 20 minutes of trading.
But the selling wave had no conviction, and the market first surged upward by 200 points, then drifted lower, *PRO* closing down 647.
Unlike two years ago, most of Japan's major investors chose *PRO*-1 to sit this calamity out.
In Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Tokyo trading room, some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly, with few orders to process.
Clients "are all staying out" of the market, one Merrill trader says 0 *T*-1.
The relative calm in Tokyo proved *-1 little comfort to markets opening up in Europe.
Frankfurt's opening was delayed *-1 a half hour because of a crush of sell orders.
"The beginning was chaotic," says *T*-1 Nigel Longley, a broker for Commerzbank
In London, the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm, Jefferies & Co., also was troubling.
A computer screen displaying 100 blue - chip stocks colors each one *PRO*-2 red when its price is falling *T*-1.
The screen was a sea of red.
"I see concern, but I don't see panic," says *T*-2 J. Francis Palamara, a New Yorker who *T*-1 runs the 15 - trader office.
London's blue - chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time, *PRO*-1 sending an encouraging message to Wall Street.
When trading opened in New York *T*-1 at 9:30 a.m. EDT, stocks fell sharply--as *PRO* expected *-2.
Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting 0 the Dow would fall by about 60 points.
With sell orders *ICH*-1 piled *-2 up from Friday, about half the stocks in the Dow couldn't open on time.
By 9:45, the industrial average had dropped 27 points.
By 10 a.m., it was down 49.
Ten minutes later, the Dow hit bottom - down 63.52 points, another 2.5%.
But shortly before then, some of Wall Street's sharpest traders say, 0 they sensed a turn.
"The first thing that *T*-1 caught my eye that *T*-2 was encouraging was 0 Treasury bonds were off," says *T*-3 Austin George, head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price.
"It meant that people weren't running pell - mell to the safety of bonds."
Shortly after 10 a.m., the Major Market Index, a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed * *PRO*-1 to mimic the DJIA, exploded upward.
Stock traders were buoyed *-1--because an upturn in the MMI had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday.
"The MMI has gone better," shouted *T*-1 a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton.
Shearson's London trading room went wild.
Traders shouted out as their Reuters, Quotron and Telerate screens posted an ever - narrowing loss on Wall Street.
Then, nine minutes later, Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day.
"Rally, rally, rally," shouted *T*-1 Shearson's Andy Rosen.
"This is panic buying."
Major blue - chip stocks like Philip Morris, General Motors and Proctor & Gamble led the rally.
Japanese were said *-1 to be heavy buyers.
German and Dutch investors reportedly loaded up on Kellogg Co.
Then, traders say 0 *?*, corporations with share buy - back programs kicked into high gear, *PRO* triggering gains in, among other issues, Alcan Aluminium and McDonald's.
Walt Disney Co., which *T*-1 had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that *T*-2 halted trading and never reopened that day, opened yesterday late at 114.5, down 8.5.
But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman, Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer, traders said 0 *T*-1.
By 10:25, the Dow had turned up for the day, *PRO* prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors.
Among Big Board specialists, the cry was "*PRO* Pull your offers"--*PRO*-2 meaning that specialists soon expected *-1 to get higher prices for their shares.
"It was bedlam on the upside," said *T*-1 one Big Board specialist.
"What we had *T*-1 was a real, old - fashioned rally."
This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street's "black boxes," computer programs designed * *PRO*-1 to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods.
Typical, perhaps, was *T*-1 Batterymarch's Dean LeBaron.
Mr. LeBaron, who *T*-1 manages $10 billion *U*, says, "We turned the trading system on, and it did whatever it was programmed *-3 *PRO*-4 to do *T*-2."
*PRO*-2 Asked *-3 what stocks the computer bought *T*-1, the money manager says, "I don't know."
Not everybody was making money.
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the nation's major options market, was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock - index options was halted *-1 Friday.
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday, and when the shutdown came *T*-2 they were frozen *-1 with huge losses.
Over the weekend, clearing firms told the Chicago market makers *PRO*-1 to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning.
"They were absolutely killed *-2, slaughtered *-2," said *T*-1 one Chicago - based options trader.
Meanwhile, a test of the stock market's rally came at about 2 p.m., with the Dow at 2600, up 31 points on the day.
Charles Clough, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, says 0 bargain hunting had explained the Dow's strength up to that point and that many market professionals were anticipating a drop in the Dow.
Moreover, the announcement that real estate magnate and sometime raider Donald Trump was withdrawing his offer for AMR Corp. might have been expected *-1 to rattle traders.
Instead, the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying.
The market closed minutes after *PRO* reaching its high for the day of
Across the country, many people took yesterday's events in stride, while *PRO*-1 remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general.
Says *ICH*-1 James Norman, the mayor of Ava, Mo.: "I don't invest in stocks.
I much prefer money 0 I can put my hands on *T*-1."
While Mayor Norman found the market's performance Monday reassuring, he says 0 *?*, he remains uneasy.
"We have half the experts saying one thing *RNR*-3 and half the other" *RNR*-3 about the course of the economy.
Ralph Holzfaster, a farmer and farm - supply store operator in Ogallala, Neb., says of the last few days events, "If anything good comes out of this, it might be that it puts some of these LBOs on the skids."
Says Gordon Fines, a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, "You're on a roller coaster, and that may last.
The public is still cautious.
Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that *T*-1 would restrict how the new savings - and - loan bailout agency can raise capital *T*-2, *PRO*-3 creating another potential obstacle to the government's sale of sick thrifts.
The bill, whose backers *T*-2 include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from *PRO*-4 raising temporary working capital by *PRO*-4 having an RTC - owned bank or thrift issue debt that *T*-3 wouldn't be counted *-1 on the federal budget.
The bill intends *PRO*-1 to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization.
"Such agency ` self - help' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive, far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing," said *T*-1 Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), the bill's chief sponsor.
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes *PRO*-1 raising $30 billion *U* from debt issued * by the newly created RTC.
This financing system was created *-1 in the new law in order *PRO*-2 to keep the bailout spending from *PRO*-3 swelling the budget deficit.
Another $20 billion *U* would be raised *-1 through Treasury bonds, which *T*-2 pay lower interest rates.
But the RTC also requires "working" capital 0 *PRO* to maintain *T*-4 the bad assets of thrifts that *T*-3 are sold *-1, until the assets can be sold *-2 separately.
That debt would be paid *-2 off as the assets are sold *-1, *PRO* leaving the total spending for the bailout at $50 billion *U*, or $166 billion *U* including interest over 10 years.
"It's a problem that *T*-2 clearly has *-3 to be resolved *-1," said *T*-4 David Cooke, executive director of the RTC.
The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion *U* *PRO*-2 selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely *-3 to sell or merge 600 by the time 0 the bailout concludes *T*-1.
Absent other working capital, he said 0 *?*, the RTC would be forced *-3 *PRO*-4 to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised *-1 by *PRO* selling the bad assets.
"We would have *-1 to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward," he said *T*-2.
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight.
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $5 billion *U* at any time.
Moreover, it says 0 the RTC's total obligations may not exceed $50 billion *U*, but that figure is derived *-1 after *PRO* including notes and other debt, and subtracting from it the market value of the assets 0 the RTC holds *T*-2.
But Congress didn't anticipate or intend more public debt, say 0 *T*-1 opponents of the RTC's working - capital plan, and Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y .) said 0 the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in *PRO*-2 not keeping Congress *PRO*-3 informed.
"That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which *T*-1 seems to me *-3 sort of draconian," he said *T*-2.
"The RTC is going *-1 to have *-2 to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility."
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday.
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen Antonia Novello to be the next surgeon general, Bush administration officials said 0 *T*-1.
If she is nominated *-2 by President Bush and confirmed *-2 by the Senate, Dr. Novello would succeed C. Everett Koop, who *T*-1 rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues.
Dr. Novello, an expert on pediatric kidney diseases, is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Dr. Novello's office said 0 she wouldn't talk with reporters, and it refused *PRO*-1 to release any information about her.
The newsletter Medicine & Health, which *T*-1 first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan, said 0 she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.
In a possible prelude to the resumption of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members, a federal mediator said 0 representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow.
"It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one," said *T*-2 Doug Hammond, the mediator, who *T*-1 called the agreement *PRO* to meet *PRO*-3 a first step toward a resumption of negotiations.
"We're encouraged *-3 that talks are scheduled *-1 again but beyond that, we have made no expression of expectations," a Boeing spokesman said *T*-2.
The Machinists union has rejected a three - year contract offer that *T*-1 would have provided a 10% wage increase over the life of the pact, plus some bonuses.
Currently, average pay for machinists is $13.39 *U* an hour, Boeing said 0 *T*-1.
Now in its 13th day, the strike has idled about 55,000 machinists and has started *-1 to delay delivery of some jetliners.
With a strike fund of about $100 million *U*, the union had said 0 it was prepared *-1 for a long strike.
After the third week on strike, union members will begin *-1 receiving $100 *U* a week from the fund.
Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other non-striking personnel manning the lines.
And at the company's Wichita, Kan., plant, about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working, Boeing said 0 *T*-1.
Under Kansas right - *PRO* to - work laws, contracts cannot require workers *PRO*-1 to be union members.
Boeing has declined *PRO*-2 to say how many employees *T*-1 are working at its giant Renton, Wash., plant.
Union officials couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
We're about *-1 to see if advertising works.
Hard on the heels of Friday's 190 - point stock - market plunge and the uncertainty that *T*-1's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message: *PRO* Keep on *PRO*-2 investing, the market's just fine.
Their mission is *PRO* to keep clients from *PRO*-1 fleeing the market, as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads *PRO* to calm investors.
This time around, they're moving even faster.
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads.
It considered *PRO*-2 running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided *PRO*-2 not to *?* when the market recovered yesterday *T*-1.
Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies.
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around, when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic *T*-1.
This time, the firms were ready.
Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.
When the market went into its free fall *T*-1 Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.
The ads touted Fidelity's automated 800 - number beneath the huge headline, "Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call."
A Fidelity spokesman says 0 the 800 - line, which *T*-1 already was operating but which many clients didn't know about *T*-2, received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend.
"A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us," he says *T*-1.
"*PRO* To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial.
It would have been too late 0 *PRO* to think about *T*-1 on Friday.
We had *-1 to think about it ahead of time."
Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, *PRO*-1 encouraging investors *PRO*-2 to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity.
Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need *-1 to know 0 their portfolios are balanced *-2 *PRO* to help *PRO*-3 protect them against the market's volatility."
It goes on *PRO*-1 to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name.
PaineWebber also was able *PRO*-1 to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash.
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began *-1 taping commercials in - house, *PRO*-1 ultimately getting its timing down fast enough *PRO* to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night.
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree *PRO*-1 to air its last - minute creations *T*-2.
The new PaineWebber commercial, created * with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co., features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.
*PRO* Taped *-1 just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, "We view the market here as *PRO*-2 going through a relatively normal cycle....
We continue *-1 to feel that the stock market is still the place 0 *PRO* to be *T*-2 for long - term appreciation."
The spot was scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to appear three times on CNN last night.
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell, *PRO* recommending specific stocks.
Instead, it settled on *PRO*-2 just urging the clients who *T*-1 are its lifeline *PRO*-3 to keep that money in the market.
"We're saying 0 the worst thing that anyone can do *T*-2 is *PRO* to see the market go down and dump everything, which *T*-1 just drives the prices down further," says *T*-3 John Lampe, PaineWebber's director of advertising.
"If you owned it and liked it Friday, the true value hasn't changed."
He adds, "This isn't 1987 revisited *."
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had *-1 to constantly revise their approach.
At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had *-1 to regroup yesterday afternoon.
The plan had been *PRO* to make one of Shearson's easy - 0 *PRO* to - film *T*-3, black - and - white "Where We Stand *T*-2" commercials, which *T*-1 have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985.
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow, *PRO*-1 replacing the debut commercial of Shearson's new ad campaign, "Leadership by Example."
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday, Shearson executives decided *PRO*-1 not to go ahead with the stock - market ad.
"We don't think at this point 0 anything needs *-2 to be said *-1.
The market seems *-1 to be straightening out; we're taking a *PRO* wait - and - see attitude," says *T*-2 Cathleen B. Stewart, executive vice president of marketing.
In any case, the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987.
But it *EXP*-2 remains *PRO* to be seen *-3 whether their ads will be any more effective.
In 1987, despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms, individuals ran from the market en masse.
Now the firms must try their hardest *PRO*-1 to prove that advertising can work this time around.
Ad Notes....
ARNOLD ADVERTISING:
Edward Eskandarian, former chairman of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS / Boston, reached an agreement *ICH*-1 in principle *PRO* to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising, a small Boston shop.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Mr. Eskandarian, who *T*-4 resigned his Della Femina post in September, becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold.
John Verret, the agency's president and chief executive, will retain the title of president.
Separately, McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., named Arnold *PRO*-1 to handle its estimated $4 million *U* cooperative ad account for the Hartford, Conn., area.
That account had been handled *-1 by Della Femina, McNamee WCRS.
EDUCATION ADS:
A 142 - page ad supplement to Business Week's special "Corporate Elite" issue calls on business leaders *PRO* to use their clout *PRO*-1 to help *PRO* solve the nation's education crisis.
The supplement, the largest ever for the magazine, includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two - year Business Week initiative on education.
The magazine will distribute 10% of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers.
Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday.
Yesterday, the stock market's influence at first created nervousness.
Later, however, it became more of an undercurrent than a dominating force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors.
Gold, the traditional haven in times of financial crisis, continued its inverse lockstep with the dollar, *PRO*-1 rising early in the day as the currency fell, and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered.
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy.
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that *T*-2 had been supporting prices appeared *-3 to be solved *-1.
Crude oil declined early, but as the stock market retained early gains, it, too, became stronger, *PRO*-1 ending with a small net loss.
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines.
In Chicago, grain and soybean prices rose slightly.
Livestock and meat prices, however, dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork.
In commodity markets yesterday: PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently, *PRO*-1 first falling and then later rising.
Silver performed quietly.
The spot October gold price rose $4 *U* to $367.30 *U* an ounce.
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $3.90 *U* an ounce at $371.20 *U*, after *PRO*-1 trading as high as $374 *U*.
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.163 *U*.
Platinum behaved more like an industrial metal, *PRO*-1 easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy, but recovering later, as the stock market strengthened.
Gold was nowhere the spectacular performer 0 it was *T*-1 two years ago on Black Monday.
For one thing, last Friday, precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late - in - the - day nose dive, so it couldn't react to it.
Back on Friday, Oct. 16, l987, the stock market declined during the day, and gold prices surged as the stock market fell.
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $8.70 *U* to as high as $471.60 *U*, and the more deferred positions, due *PRO* to mature as late as March 1989, rose as much as $9.60 *U*.
On Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, the October contract tacked on further gains, *PRO*-1 rising to as high as $491.50 *U* for a gain of almost $20 *U* on top of the Friday advances, before *PRO*-2 giving up almost $10 *U* of that at the close.
Yesterday's October gain of $4 *U* was miniscule compared with that.
One analyst, Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co., New York, said 0 the gold market already had some good price - supporting technical factors that *T*-1 would have caused prices to rise, with or without the stock market.
"What the stock market did *T*-1 was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened *?*," said *T*-2 Mr. Cardillo.
There's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further, he said 0 *T*-1.
He expects a drop in interest rates, which *T*-1 would help gold by *PRO*-2 keeping the dollar from *PRO*-3 rising.
Finally, according to Mr. Cardillo, the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected *-1 in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit, when the figures are released *-2 today *T*-3.
This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold, he said 0 *T*-1.
ENERGY:
*PRO*-1 Worried that Friday's 190 - point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things 0 *T*-2 to come for the economy, petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices.
The U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $20.59 *U* a barrel for November delivery, down 30 cents.
Some analysts said 0 crude was due for a correction anyhow, following several days of significant gains.
But most market observers agreed that Friday's stock market drop is what *T*-1 dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday.
Until yesterday, futures prices had been headed *-1 up on expectations that world oil demand will continue *-2 to be strong.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand.
So any bearish indicator, such as Friday's precipitous drop in the stock market, sends shivers through the oil markets as well.
Indeed, after *PRO*-1 reacting early in the trading day to Friday's plummet, futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market's partial recovery yesterday.
COPPER:
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that *T*-2 had been underpinning prices appeared *-3 to be solved *-1.
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $1.2745 *U*.
Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a consequent reduction in copper use.
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word *ICH*-1 spread that a three - month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over, according to an analyst.
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan, which *T*-1 recently began *-2 seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank.
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle, the contracting out of work by the company.
Now, the analyst said 0 *?*, only minor points remain *PRO*-1 to be cleaned *-2 up.
"For all intents and purposes, an agreement appears *-2 to have been achieved *-3," he said *T*-1.
Copper inventories in New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons, to 10,004 tons.
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons, to 89,300 tons.
The LME stocks decline was about as *PRO* expected *-1, but the Comex gain wasn't *?*.
However, this was brushed *-1 aside by concern over the stock market, the analyst said 0 *T*-2.
At one point in futures trading, as the stock market firmed, the December contract rose to as high as $1.2965 *U*, but it wasn't able *PRO*-1 to sustain the gain.
"It was simply overbought," he said 0 *?*, and selling by funds that *T*-1 are computer guided helped *PRO*-3 depress prices.
COTTON:
Futures prices eased, more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market.
The December contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound, at 74.48 cents.
Technical considerations following the hurricane, which *T*-1 was a factor in the market Friday, caused prices to decline yesterday, said 0 *T*-2 Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential - Bache Securities, New York.
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana, which *T*-1 is part of the Mississippi Delta cotton - growing area.
However, after *PRO*-1 absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane, prices began *-1 to slip late Friday, Mr. Simon said 0 *T*-2.
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices *PRO*-2 under pressure, he said 0 *T*-1.
Colder weather *ICH*-3 is being predicted *-1 for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend, Mr. Simon said 0 *T*-2.
That hasn't yet captured traders' attention, he added 0 *T*-1.
SUGAR:
Futures prices declined.
The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents.
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered *T*-1, but the price then fell back.
A price - depressing factor, one analyst said 0 *?*, was that India, which *T*-1 had been expected *-3 to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market, didn't make any purchases.
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected *-1 to buy more, the analyst said 0 *T*-2.
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market.
"India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar, it could buy at lower prices," said *T*-1 Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
At any rate, she added 0 *?*, "India needs the sugar, so it will be in sooner or later *PRO*-2 to buy it."
FARM PRODUCTS:
The prices of cattle and hog futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will linger in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough *PRO*-2 to prompt them *PRO*-3 to rein in their spending at the supermarket, which *T*-1 would hurt demand for beef and pork.
The price of the hog contract for October delivery dropped its maximum permissible daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound.
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of *PRO* recovering.
Earlier in the session, the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows.
A broad rally began when several major processors began *-2 buying futures contracts, apparently *PRO*-3 to take advantage of the price dip *T*-1.
EAST GERMANS RALLIED as officials reportedly sought Honecker's ouster.
In what *T*-2 was considered *-1 the largest protest in the Communist state's 40 - year history, at least 120,000 demonstrators marched through the southern city of Leipzig *PRO*-4 to press demands for democratic freedoms, opposition activists said 0 *T*-3.
Police didn't intervene.

E. Robert Wallach was sentenced *-1 by a U.S. judge in New York to six years in prison and fined *-1 $250,000 *U* for his racketeering conviction in the Wedtech scandal.
Wallach, an associate of ex-Attorney General Meese, was found *-2 *-2 guilty *ICH*-1 in August of *PRO*-3 taking $425,000 *U* in illegal payoffs from the now - defunct defense contractor.
NASA resumed the countdown for today's launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, and a federal appeals court in Washington dismissed a lawsuit by anti-nuclear groups 0 *T*-1 to delay the flight because the plutonium - powered Galileo space probe was aboard.
The space agency said 0 it didn't expect weather or protesters to block the liftoff.
The Bush administration is preparing *PRO*-1 to extend a ban on federal financing of research using fetal tissue, government sources said 0 *T*-2.

The Egyptian president said 0 he would visit Libya today *PRO*-1 to resume the talks.

Danilo Kis, 54, Yugoslav - born novelist and essayist, Sunday, in Paris, of cancer.
Hertz Corp. of Park Ridge, N.J., said 0 it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets *PRO*-1 to sell its Hertz Equipment Rental Corp. unit.
"There is no pressing need *PRO* to sell the unit, but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business, *PRO* renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad," said *T*-1 William Slider, Hertz's executive vice president.
"We are only going *-1 to sell at the right price."
Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $90 million *U* on revenue of $150 million *U* in 1988.
The closely held Hertz Corp. had annual revenue of close to $2 billion *U* in 1988, of which $1.7 billion *U* *T*-2 was contributed *-1 by its Hertz *PRO* Rent A Car operations world - wide.
Hertz Equipment is a major supplier of rental equipment in the U.S., France, Spain and the U.K.
It supplies commercial and industrial equipment including earth - moving, aerial, compaction and electrical equipment, compressors, cranes, forklifts and trucks.
Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for *PRO* not sending enough aid to Poland, so it is getting ready *PRO*-1 to send its own version of a CARE package.
Last month, the Senate voted *PRO*-1 to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland *PRO*-2 to assist its legislature, the Sejm, in democratic procedures.
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort *PRO*-1 "the first gift of democracy."
The Poles might do better *PRO*-1 to view it as a Trojan Horse.
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that *T*-2 helps *PRO*-3 create such legislative atrocities as the 1,376 page, 13 - pound reconciliation bill that *T*-1 claimed *PRO*-4 to be the budget of the United States.
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles, they'd be willing *PRO*-1 to come back and do the same for the American people.
West Germany's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle 0 *PRO* to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium - powered Galileo probe to Jupiter *T*-1.

A three - judge appeals panel yesterday refused *PRO*-1 to comply, though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way *PRO*-2 to deny that this was a "frivolous" case.
Of course it was *?*.
NASA should now sue for fines against all three politico - plaintiffs, foreign and domestic, for *PRO* bringing this mischievous case.
Britain's Blue Arrow PLC intends *PRO*-1 to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $1.2 billion *U* in good will realized * in the takeover of U.S. - based Manpower Inc.
Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to *PRO* reincorporating the world's biggest employment - services group in the U.S. .
Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps, expected * within a few months, as Blue Arrow posted a 2.5% drop in its third - quarter pretax earnings.
The name change and good will write - off could help *PRO*-1 solidify Blue Arrow's dominance of the U.S. temporary - help market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday's market plunge.
U.S. holders now own more than 60% of Blue Arrow compared with 9% last January.
"In the U.S. market, the recognition of the Manpower name is infinitely stronger than Blue Arrow," Mr. Fromstein said *T*-1.
The moves also could erase shareholders' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil.
"It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past," said *T*-1 Doug Arthur, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York.
The proposed changes "all make a lot of sense to me," he added 0 *T*-1.
In a widely publicized boardroom coup, Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January, a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $1 million *U* - a - year chief of Milwaukee - based Manpower.
Mr. Fromstein solidified his control in April by *PRO*-1 taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman.
But the Blue Arrow tumult isn't over yet, as the British government is investigating a disputed #25 million *U* ($39.4 million *U*) loan which Mr. Fromstein has said 0 *T*-2 was made *-1 under Mr. Berry's direction.
Blue Arrow was able *PRO*-1 to pull off the $1.34 billion *U* takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies.
Under British rules, Blue Arrow was able *PRO*-1 to write off at once the $1.15 billion *U* in good will arising from the purchase.
*PRO*-1 As a U.S. - based company, Blue Arrow would have *-1 to amortize the good will over as many as 40 years, *PRO* creating a continuing drag on reported earnings.
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm, operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets.
But with so many shares now held * in the U.S., Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways, based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards.
"Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice's wonderland," Mr. Fromstein said *T*-1.
The British version shows "a handful of pounds of net worth" following the 1987 write - off of good will, while the American version reflects "$1 billion *U* of net worth because almost none of {the good will} has been written *-1 off."
Mr. Fromstein said 0 he hopes *PRO*-1 to eradicate some of the good will left * on Blue Arrow's U.S. books in one fell swoop, but wouldn't specify how much.
People close to Blue Arrow suggested 0 the write - down would represent a sizable chunk, with executives claiming 0 prior management overstated the extent of Manpower's good will.
That move, along with the return to the Manpower name, could bolster the company's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help.
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1% in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, after *PRO*-2 sliding nearly 3.5% in July, said 0 *T*-1 Kidder Peabody's Mr. Arthur.
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of non-Manpower units in Britain.
Overall, pretax profit slid to #18.49 million *U* in the quarter from #18.98 million *U* a year earlier.
The Communications Workers of America ratified a new regional contract and all but one of the local agreements with Bell Atlantic Corp.
CWA's New Jersey Commercial local, which *T*-1 represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees, rejected the tentative agreement.
Both the union and the regional telephone company said 0 they were working together *PRO*-1 to resolve differences.
The new three - year contracts, which *T*-1 replace ones that *T*-2 expired Aug. 5, cover 41,000 Bell Atlantic employees.
The ratification follows a 23 - day strike against the Philadelphia - based company.
Meanwhile, CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members remain on strike against Nynex Corp., the New York - based regional phone company.
The unions and the company last week agreed to mediation.
The CWA represents 40,000 Nynex workers and the IBEW represents 20,000 workers.
While Friday's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy's prospects, a little - known indicator that *T*-1 has faithfully foreshadowed the economy's ups and downs by exceptionally long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity.
The barometer, developed * by analysts at Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle Research here, reached a record high of 223.0 in August, the latest month available, and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then.
The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which *T*-1 uses the 1967 average as a base of 100.
In contrast, the Commerce Department's widely followed index of leading indicators, while up in August, has fallen repeatedly since *PRO*-1 reaching a high early this year.
Its ragged behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters *PRO*-1 to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year's end.
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index "makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely," says 0 *T*-1 Geoffrey H. Moore, the director of the Columbia facility.
*PRO*-2 A leading authority on the business cycle, Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business Cycle Dating Group, the panel of private economists that *T*-1 decides for the government when expansions and recessions begin and end *T*-3.
The group normally convenes only when a change in the economy's general course seems *-2 likely *T*-1.
"No meeting is scheduled *-1 because the expansion shows no sign of *PRO* going off the tracks," Mr. Moore reports *T*-2.
*PRO* Based *-1 largely on the recent strength in their index, called *PRO* *PRO*-2 the long leading indicator, the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.
They expect a 2.6% rise in 1990 in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation.
Underlying this optimism is *T*-1 the index's longstanding ability *PRO* to signal recessions or recoveries, as the case may be *?*, by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
Over the full post-World War II era, the Columbia index, on the average, has entered sustained declines 14 months before the onset of recessions and turned up eight months before recoveries.
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index, whose components *T*-1 include the stock market, are far shorter--10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries.
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved *T*-2, had it existed, in 1929, before the stock market crash in October that *T*-1 ushered in the Great Depression.
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to *RNR*-1 and through *RNR*-1 the crash.
"It was an entirely different pattern from what we're seeing *T*-1 now," Mr. Moore says *T*-2.
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond - price index, which *T*-1 is not a part of the Commerce index.
In August, the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987.
It also rose last Friday, while the stock market sagged.
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries, the M2 version of the money supply, adjusted * for inflation, and the volume of new home - building permits.
Notably absent from the Columbia index is *T*-2 the stock market, which Mr. Moore says 0 "*T*-1 is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy's long - range prospects, though it still is useful for *PRO* anticipating some short - run twists and turns."
As recently as 1975, the stock market--as *PRO* reflected *-3 in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 common stocks--was rated *-1 by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that *T*-2 then made up the Commerce index.
It was assigned *-1 a mark of 80 out of a possible 100, compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components.
The stock market has lost some precursory power, analysts at the Columbia center claim 0 *?*, because of the growing impact of international developments.
"Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied * to the domestic economy," Mr. Moore says *T*-1, *PRO*-2 citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets, the foreign - trade balance and inflows of foreign capital.
He also feels that the rise of such computer - based practices as program trading has diminished the stock market's relevancy to the economic outlook.
Waterford Wedgwood PLC, a financially troubled Irish maker of fine crystal and Wedgwood china, reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish punts ($14.9 million *U*) from 5.8 million Irish punts a year earlier.
The results for the half were worse than market expectations, which *T*-1 suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish punts.
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday, Waterford shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence (79 cents).
The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish punts, compared with a loss of 9.3 million Irish punts for the year - earlier period.
There weren't any extraordinary items.
Sales for the total group rose 27% to 168.1 million Irish punts compared with 132.6 million Irish punts a year ago.
Waterford has decided against *PRO*-1 paying an interim dividend.
Waterford said 0 the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected *-1 to enhance the company's long - term prospects.
An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia.
This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over *T*-1 in the expectation that it's going *-2 to hold an election.
The most likely winner will be the Marxist - dominated SWAPO rebels.
The U.S. journalist's "crime" was writing that the head of the commission charged * with *PRO*-1 overseeing the election's fairness, Bryan O'Linn, was openly sympathetic to SWAPO.
Shortly after that, Mr. O'Linn had Scott Stanley arrested *-1 and his passport confiscated *-2.
Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a proclamation, issued * by the South African administrator general earlier this year, which *T*-1 made it *EXP*-2 a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to "insult, disparate or belittle" the election commission.
The Stanley affair doesn't bode well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when SWAPO starts *-2 running the government *T*-1.
To the extent 0 Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong, it may be that he is out of step with the consensus *ICH*-1 of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa.
SWAPO has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the "sole, authentic representative" of Namibia's people in
Last year, the U.S. brokered a peace settlement *PRO* to remove Cuba's "Afrika Korps" from Angola and hold "free and fair" elections that *T*-1 would end South Africa's control of Namibia.
The elections are set *-1 for Nov. 7.
In July, Mr. Stanley, editor of American Press International, a Washington D.C. - based conservative wire service, visited Namibia *PRO*-1 to report on the U.N. - monitored election campaign.
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn, head of a commission charged * with *PRO*-1 investigating electoral intimidation, and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court.
After Mr. Stanley's article was published *-1 in two Namibian newspapers, Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors, publisher and lawyer.
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged *-1 along with the others when he returned to Namibia this month *T*-2.
Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have protested Mr. Stanley's detention.
Mr. Stanley's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that *T*-1 threaten *PRO*-2 to derail Namibia's elections.
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters.
The U.S. is in the habit of *PRO* arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results.
It now has the chance *PRO* to redress that record in Namibia.
State and the human - rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released *-1 and that the United Nation's monitors make certain that Mr. O'Linn's commission investigates election complaints from all sides.
Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty chemicals marketing concern, said 0 SHV Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands has built up a 6.7% stake in the company.
James Alexander, a Burmah spokesman, said 0 SHV had previously owned "a little under 5%" of Burmah for about two years.
The Dutch company hadn't notified Burmah of its reason for *PRO* increasing the stake, he said 0 *T*-1.
SHV, which *T*-2 last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC, has been pegged *-1 by speculators as a possible suitor for Burmah Oil in recent weeks.
SHV also owns 40% of Calor.
Burmah, which *T*-1 owns the Castrol brand of lubricant oils, reported a 17% rise in net income to #43.5 million *U* ($68.3 million *U*) in the first half.
Agip S.p . A. and Societe National Elf Aquitaine, the state oil companies of Italy and France, respectively, submitted an offer *PRO* to buy Gatoil Suisse S.A.
The price wasn't disclosed *-1.
A spokesman for Gatoil said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer, submitted * last Friday, along with two other offers, also submitted * last week.
Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused *PRO*-1 to identify the bidding companies.
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers *ICH*-2 are expected *-1 from other companies within two weeks.
Gatoil Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day, along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets.
Chicken Chains Ruffled *-1 By Loss of Customers
FAST - FOOD chicken chains, faced * with a worsening business slump, are struggling *PRO*-1 to hatch some new marketing strategies.
The Crest Report, which *T*-1 tracks consumer purchases, says 0 customer traffic at chicken restaurants fell 10% in the second quarter, while the overall fast - food customer count was down 2%.
Chicken business is off largely because of more competition from grocery - store convenience food, home - delivered pizza and other takeout fare, says 0 *T*-1 a spokesman for the report, a publication of NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems.
Church's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken Inc., which *T*-2 have merged, are still troubled *-1 by overlapping restaurant locations.
Chicken chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald's Corp., which *T*-1 introduced its McChicken sandwich this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of chicken.
New management at Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., has fought back with new medium and large chicken sandwiches for the lunch crowd.
And the chain is testing products that *T*-2 aren't fried *-1, such as "char - grilled" chicken, *PRO*-4 to try *PRO*-3 to win health - conscious consumers.
Kentucky Fried Chicken also is testing home - delivery of chicken, which *T*-1 could be a hit with *PRO* stay - at - home diners.
But some fast - food industry analysts say 0 problems with *PRO* keeping chicken *PRO*-2 warm and fresh must be solved *-1 first.
A Kentucky Fried Chicken spokesman, however, disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued *-1 *T*-2.
He says 0 the test is continuing in Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, and a few other cities.
The advertising industry is buzzing with rumors that Kentucky Fried Chicken will drop Young & Rubicam and seek a new ad agency.
But the company declines *PRO*-1 to comment.
Emanuel Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, predicts 0 Kentucky Fried Chicken will post an 11% drop in 1989 net income.
"They've been laggard," he says *?*, "but they'll have *-2 to become more aggressive."
Reluctant Advertisers Try Soft - Sell Spots
*PRO* CALL IT *PRO*-1 un-advertising.
Pittsburgh consultant David Bear is selling a soft approach to clients who *T*-1 want exposure yet shun pushy ads.
His ploy: 60 - second radio spots that *T*-1 offer helpful hints.
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot.
The messages resemble the Business Traveler, a daily dose of travel tips developed * by Mr. Bear and sponsored * by travel agencies in several major cities.
New un-advertisers include Burt Hill Kosar Rittlemann Associates, a Butler, Pa., architectural firm.
Its radio series features such spots as "Floodlights: Evening Wear for Urban Structures" and "*PRO* Building a Place 0 *PRO* to Park *T*-1."
A harder sell, says 0 *?* John Kosar, the firm's president, would "detract from the profession."
Hospitals have signed up *PRO*-1 to use the messages *PRO*-2 to promote fundraisers, and Equitable Gas Co. is considering the format *PRO*-3 to offer energy tips to consumers.
But such spots can be too soft.
"There's always a risk of lost messages," says *T*-2 John Fitzgerald, chairman of Ketchum Advertising USA, which *T*-1 created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank.
"It's a question of how much credibility you gain *T*-1 for the possible loss of recognition."
Retailer Sees Pitfalls In Environmental Push
HERE'S *T*-2 a retailer that *T*-1's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products.
Big Bear Supermarkets Inc., a grocery chain based * in San Diego, plans *PRO*-2 to display shelf cards *RNR*-1 and distribute pamphlets *RNR*-1 recommending products deemed * safe for the environment.
The choices will be based *-1 on research by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition and will include products like Murphy's Oil Soap and other noncorrosive cleaners.
But the chain is quickly realizing the pitfalls of such endorsements.
For example, it recommends nonchlorinated dishwasher detergent and puts Sunlight on its environmentally safe list.
That doesn't thrill Procter & Gamble Co., maker of Cascade dishwasher detergent.
A company spokesman questioned the validity of the list, *PRO*-1 noting that chlorine is present in all major dishwasher detergents.
In fact, Lever Bros. confirms that its Sunlight brand does contain chlorine bleach, even though it isn't listed *-1 on the label for the powder version.
Thomas G. Dahlen, Big Bear's executive vice president, said 0 the chain is still reviewing its product list *PRO*-1 to avoid such problems.
"Our intent is *PRO* to promote the best alternative," he says *T*-1.
"And it *EXP*-1's important that we be accurate."
But in the end, customers' wishes are what *T*-1 will prevail.
Big Bear doesn't care for disposable diapers, which *T*-1 aren't biodegradable.
Yet parents demand them.
Says *ICH*-3 Mr. Dahlen, "We'll still be forced *-1 *PRO*-4 to sell items 0 we might not philosophically agree with *T*-2."
Odds and Ends
NEATNESS does count--at least in the grocery store.
A study by Safeway's Scanner Marketing Research shows 0 soap sales climbed 5% when bars were neatly stacked *-1 on shelves instead of dumped *-1 in a wire basket *T*-2....
Which celebrity endorsers *T*-1 are most believable?
For the third year in a row, consumers voted Bill Cosby *PRO*-1 first *RNR*-3 and James Garner *PRO*-4 second *RNR*-3 in persuasiveness as spokesmen in TV commercials, according to Video Storyboard Tests, New York.
Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce Willis in third place; Cher placed fourth for the second time.
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said 0 the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney's office in Baltimore.
Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens, N.Y., company's officials or employees have been charged *-1 with any crimes.
Vitarine won approval *PRO* to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests.
Mr. Nesbit also said 0 the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. *PRO*-1 to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic.
But so far the company hasn't complied with that request, the spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Bolar, the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the Inspector General's office of the Health and Human Services Department, only agreed *PRO*-1 to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin "as far down as direct customers, mostly wholesalers," Mr. Nesbit said 0 *T*-2.
Bolar, of Copiague, N.Y., earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug.
The FDA has said 0 it presented evidence 0 it uncovered *T*-1 *ICH*-2 to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand - name product for its own *PRO*-3 to gain government approval *PRO* to sell generic versions of Macrodantin.
Bolar has denied that it switched the brand - name product for its own in such testing.
As small investors peppered their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend, big fund managers said 0 they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals: cash.
Unlike the weekend before Black Monday, the funds weren't swamped *-1 with heavy withdrawal requests.
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say 0 they will be buying stock this week.
At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund company, telephone volume was up sharply, but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987.
The Boston firm said 0 stock - fund redemptions were running at less than one - third the level two years ago.
As of yesterday afternoon, the redemptions represented less than 15% of the total cash position of about $2 billion *U* of Fidelity's stock funds.
"Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around," said *T*-2 C. Bruce Johnstone, who *T*-1 runs Fidelity Investments' $5 billion *U* Equity - Income Fund.
"This feels more like a one - shot deal.
People aren't panicking."
The test may come today.
Friday's stock market sell - off came too late for many investors to act.
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made * after Friday's close would take place at today's closing prices.
Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle didn't begin *-1 to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday.
But fund managers say 0 they're ready.
Many have raised cash levels, which *T*-1 act as a buffer against steep market declines.
Mario Gabelli, for instance, holds cash positions well above 20% in several of his funds.
Windsor Fund's John Neff and Mutual Series' Michael Price said 0 they had raised their cash levels to more than 20% and 30% *U*, respectively, this year.
Even Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity's $12.7 billion *U* Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, built up cash to 7% or $850 million *U*.
One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions, the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September.
"I've let the money build up," Mr. Lynch *ICH*-2 said *T*-1, who *T*-4 added that he has had trouble *PRO*-5 finding stocks 0 he likes *T*-3.
Not all funds have raised cash levels, of course.
As a group, stock funds held 10.2% of assets *ICH*-1 in cash as of August, the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute.
That was modestly higher than the 8.8% and 9.2% levels in August and September of 1987.
Also, persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks *PRO*-1 to raise cash.
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around, fund managers said 0 *T*-1.
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday.
Stock - fund sales have rebounded in recent months, but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels.
"There's not nearly as much froth," said *T*-1 John Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group Inc., a big Valley Forge, Pa., fund company.
Many fund managers argue that now's *T*-2 the time 0 *PRO* to buy *T*-1.
Vincent Bajakian, manager of the $1.8 billion *U* Wellington Fund, added to his positions in Bristol - Myers Squibb, Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday.
And today he'll be looking *PRO*-3 to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly, Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields *T*-2 have been bolstered *-1 by stock declines.
Fidelity's Mr. Lynch, for his part, snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered *-1.
If the market drops further today, he said 0 he'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol - Myers and Kellogg.
"If they croak stocks like that," he said *?*, it presents an opportunity that *T*-1 is "the kind of thing 0 you dream about *T*-3."
Major mutual - fund groups said 0 phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday.
But most investors were seeking share prices and other information.
Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal.
Still, fund groups aren't taking any chances.
They hope *PRO*-2 to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that *T*-1 infuriated some fund investors in October 1987.
Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk - in investor centers across the country.
The centers normally are closed through the weekend.
In addition, East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT *ICH*-1 this morning, instead of the normal 8:30.
T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives 0 *T*-1 to handle investor requests.
The Baltimore - based group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money - market funds.
But most investors seemed *-1 to be "in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode," said 0 *T*-2 Steven Norwitz, a vice president.
And Vanguard, among other groups, said 0 it was adding more phone representatives today *PRO*-1 to help investors get through.
In an unusual move, several funds moved *PRO*-1 to calm investors with recordings on their toll - free phone lines.
"We view {Friday's} market decline as *PRO*-1 offering us a buying opportunity as long - term investors," a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said *T*-2 over the weekend.
The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors.
Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize.
Some early selling is likely *-2 to stem from investors and portfolio managers who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to lock in this year's fat profits.
Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25% through September, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
Elaine Garzarelli, who *T*-1 runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s $335 million *U* Sector Analysis Portfolio, predicts 0 the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and "some panic selling."
But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors 0 she expects 0 the stock market won't decline more than 10% to 15% *U* from recent highs.
"This is not a major crash," she said *T*-1.
Nevertheless, Ms. Garzarelli said 0 she was swamped *-1 with phone calls *ICH*-2 over the weekend from nervous shareholders.
"Half of them are really scared and want *PRO*-1 to sell," she said, "but I'm trying *PRO*-2 to talk them out of it."
She added, 0 "If they all were bullish, I'd really be upset."
The backdrop to Friday's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash, fund managers argue 0 *T*-1.
Two years ago, unlike today, the dollar was weak, interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued, they say 0 *T*-1.
"From the investors' standpoint, institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson...by *PRO*-1 selling at the lows" on Black Monday, said 0 *T*-2 Stephen Boesel, manager of the $580 million *U* T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund.
This time, "I don't think 0 we'll get a panic reaction.
CONCORDE trans-Atlantic flights are $2,400 *U* to Paris and $3,200 *U* to London.
In a Centennial Journal article Oct. 5, the fares were reversed *-1.
The only thing 0 Robert Goldberg could praise *T*-1 about CBS's new show "Island Son" (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 25) was the local color; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework.
For instance: "Haole" (white) is not the ultimate insult; "Mainland haole" is *?*.
Richard Chamberlain dresses as a "Mainland haole," *PRO*-1 tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves.
And the local expression for brother is "brah," not "bruddah."
And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while *PRO*-1 on duty, if she were engaged she would know *PRO*-2 to wear them behind her left, not right, ear.
Sorry, the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color.

The following issues were recently filed *-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission:
American Cyanamid Co., offering of 1,250,000 common shares, via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. said 0 it formed a $53.4 million *U* limited partnership subsidiary 0 *T*-1 to buy land in California suitable for residential development.
The partnership, Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership, is a 50 - 50 joint venture with a trust created * by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp., a unit of Heitman Financial Corp., a real estate advisory, management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills, Calif.
Kaufman & Broad, a home building company, declined *PRO*-1 to identify the institutional investors.
The land 0 *T*-2 to be purchased *-1 by the joint venture hasn't yet received zoning and other approvals required * for development, and part of Kaufman & Broad's job will be *PRO* to obtain such approvals.
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development, but in return, it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices, which *T*-2 can result in sizable savings, said 0 *T*-1 Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad.
"There are really very few companies that *T*-3 have adequate capital 0 *PRO* to buy properties in a raw state for cash *T*-1.
Typically, developers option property, and then once they get the administrative approvals, they buy it," said *T*-1 Mr. Karatz, *PRO*-2 adding that he believes 0 the joint venture is the first of its kind.
"We usually operate in that conservative manner."
By *PRO*-1 setting up the joint venture, Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of *PRO*-1 buying raw land, while *PRO*-1 avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet, Mr. Karatz said 0 *T*-2.
The company is putting up only 10% of the capital, although it is responsible for *PRO*-1 providing management, planning and processing services to the joint venture.
"This is one of the best ways 0 *PRO* to assure a pipeline of land 0 *T*-2 to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company *T*-3," Mr. Karatz said *T*-1.
Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-2 to pay $1.5 million *U* as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a defunct smelter 0 the company formerly operated *T*-1 in Idaho.
In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources, which *T*-1 was a part - owner of the smelter, that it was potentially liable for *PRO*-2 sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal Superfund program.
The 21 - square - mile area is contaminated with lead, zinc and other metals.
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that *T*-1 would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern, *PRO*-2 potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter's cleanup costs.
The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA, it "made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into * after the reorganization."
The company, which *T*-3 issued a statement on the agreement late Friday, said that $1 million *U* of the payment was previously provided for *-2 in its financial statements and that $500,000 *U* will be recognized *-1 in its 1989 third - quarter statement.
The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Gulf Resources added that it "will seek *PRO*-2 to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities 0 it may incur *T*-1 under the Superfund law."
Under the agreement, Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days' advance written notice before *PRO*-1 issuing any dividends on common stock.
The company's net worth cannot fall below $185 million *U* after the dividends are issued *-1.
"The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf's reorganization, which we anticipate 0 *T*-2 will occur sometime in early 1990," said *T*-1 Lawrence R. Mehl, Gulf's general counsel.
In addition, Gulf must give the government 20 days' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $50 million *U* that *T*-2 are made *-1 to the Bermuda - based holding company.
Gulf's net worth after those transaction must be at least $150 million *U*.
Separately, the company said 0 it expects *PRO*-3 to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 *PRO*-1 to vote on its proposed reorganization.
Japan's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3% from a year earlier and were up 0.4% from the previous month, the Bank of Japan announced 0 *T*-1 Friday.
The wholesale price index stood at 90.1, compared with a 1985 base of 100.
The real estate slump that *T*-1's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city's retail real estate market.
In Manhattan, once - desirable store sites sit *PRO*-2 vacant and newly constructed space has been slow 0 *PRO* to fill *T*-1.
Retail real estate brokers say 0 tenants are reluctant *PRO*-1 to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy, turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom.
"There is an unbelievable amount of space available," says *T*-2 Faith Consolo, senior vice president at Garrick - Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc.
There are about 2,000 stores for rent, up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500.
"This further confuses retailers," she says *T*-1.
"They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down?
Is this the wrong time 0 *PRO* to open a store *T*-1?
Who *T*-1 is going *-2 to be in the space next door?"
In addition, Ms. Consolo says 0 *?*, tenants usually can negotiate *PRO*-2 to pay rents that *T*-1 are about one - quarter lower than landlords' initial asking price.
A handful of hot retail locations, such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas, have been able *PRO*-1 to sustain what many see *T*-2 as astronomical rents.
And, in some neighborhoods, rents have merely hit a plateau.
But on average, Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10% to 15% in the past six months alone, experts say 0 *T*-1.
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months, after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986.
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing.
"As businesses contract or depart, the number of employees who *T*-1 might use retail services shrinks," says *T*-2 Edward A. Friedman, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc.
He says 0 financial problems plaguing electronics, fur and furniture companies--key categories in the local retail economy--have further deflated the market.
Hardest hit *-2 are *T*-1 what he calls *T*-3 *PRO*-5 "secondary" sites that *T*-4 primarily serve neighborhood residents.
In these locations, Mr. Friedman says 0 *?*, "Retailers are increasingly cautious about *PRO*-2 expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined."
Weakness in the restaurant industry, which *T*-1 is leaving retail space *PRO*-2 vacant, exacerbates the problem for landlords.
It *EXP*-2 is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores, which *T*-1 anchor retail neighborhoods, are in doubt *T*-3.
Hooker Corp., parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's, is mired *-1 in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale's is for sale by its owner, Campeau Corp.
The trend toward lower rents may seem *-1 surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.
But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed *-1 *T*-2.
Certainly, the recent drop in prices doesn't mean 0 Manhattan comes cheap.
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities.
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $500 *U* a square foot, and $250 *U* is not uncommon.
The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $100 *U* a square foot, as do up - and - coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue *?*.
By contrast, rentals in the best retail locations in Boston, San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $100 *U* a square foot.
And rents on Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive generally don't exceed about $125 *U* a square foot.
The New York Stock Exchange said 0 two securities will begin *-1 trading this week.
Precision Castparts Corp., Portland, Ore., will begin *-1 trading with the symbol PCP.
It makes investment castings and has traded over - the - counter.
Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, an Edinburgh, Scotland, financial services company, will list American depositary shares, *PRO*-1 representing preferred shares, with the symbol RBSPr.
It will continue *-1 to trade on the International Stock Exchange, London.
The American Stock Exchange listed shares of two companies.
AIM Telephones Inc., a Parsippany, N.J., telecommunications equipment supply company, started *-1 trading with the symbol AIM.
It had traded over - the - counter.
Columbia Laboratories Inc., Miami, began *-1 trading with the symbol COB.
The pharmaceuticals maker had traded over - the - counter.
The National Market System of the Nasdaq over - the - counter market listed shares of one company.
Employee Benefit Plans Inc., a Minneapolis health - care services company, was listed *-1 with the symbol EBPI.
Southmark Corp. said that it filed part of its 10 - K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that the filing doesn't include its audited financial statements and related information.
The real estate and thrift concern, *PRO*-1 operating under bankruptcy - law proceedings, said 0 it told the SEC 0 it couldn't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension "without unreasonable burden or expense."
The company asked for a 15 - day extension Sept. 30, when the financial reports were due *T*-1.
Southmark said 0 it plans *PRO*-2 to amend its 10K *PRO*-3 to provide financial results as soon as its audit is completed *-1.
Just when it *EXP*-1 seemed *-3 safe *PRO* to go back into stocks *T*-2, Wall Street suffered another severe attack of nerves.
Does this signal 0 another Black Monday is coming?
Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity, just like Oct. 19, 1987, eventually turned out *-1 to be *?*?
Here's *T*-4 what several leading market experts and money managers say *T*-2 about Friday's action, what *T*-1 happens next and what investors should do *T*-3.
Joseph Granville.
"I'm the only one who *T*-1 said 0 there would be an October massacre, all through late August and September," says *T*-2 Mr. Granville, once a widely followed market guru and still a well - known newsletter writer.
"Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987," he says *T*-1.
"Well, in some ways it is different, but technically it is just the same.
If you're a technician, you obey the signals.
Right now they're telling me *PRO*-1 to get the hell out and stay out.
I see no major support until 2200.
I see a possibility of *PRO* going to 2200 this month."
Mr. Granville says 0 he wouldn't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52 - week lows; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday.
"Most people," he says *?*, "have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like *T*-1."
Elaine Garzarelli.
*PRO*-1 A quantitative analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Ms. Garzarelli had warned clients *PRO*-2 to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash.
Friday's big drop, she says 0 *?*, "was not a crash.
This was an October massacre" like those that *T*-1 occurred in 1978 and 1979.
Now, as in those two years, her stock market indicators are positive.
So she thinks 0 the damage will be short - lived and contained.
"Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12% *U* down," she says *T*-1.
"This is exactly the same thing, as far as I'm concerned *-1."
Thus, she says 0 *?*, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below 2450, "It would just be a fluke.
My advice is *PRO* to buy."
As she calculates it, the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies' earnings.
She says 0 that ratio could climb to 14.5, given current interest rates, and still be within the range of "fair value."
Ned Davis.
Friday's fall marks the start of a bear market, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc.
But Mr. Davis, whose views *T*-1 are widely respected *-2 by money managers, says 0 he expects no 1987 - style crash.
"There was a unique combination in 1987," he says *T*-1.
"Margin debt was at a record high.
There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds.
The main thing was portfolio insurance," a mechanical trading system intended * to protect an investor against losses . "
A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject" to it.
In 1987, such selling contributed to a snowball effect.
Today could even be an up day, Mr. Davis says 0 *?*, if major brokerage firms agree *PRO*-2 to refrain from program trading.
Over the next several months, though, he says 0 things look bad.
"I think 0 the market will be heading down into November," he says *T*-1.
"We will probably have a year - end rally, and then go down again.
Sort of a two - step bear market."
He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year.
"That would be a normal bear market," he says *T*-1.
"I guess 0 that's my forecast."
Leon G. Cooperman.
"I don't think 0 the market is going through another October '87.
I don't think 0 that's the case at all," says *T*-1 Mr. Cooperman, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time 0 *PRO* to pick up bargains *T*-1, but he doesn't think 0 there's any need *PRO* to rush.
"I expect the market to open *PRO*-1 weaker Monday, but then it should find some stability."
He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago.
Unlike 1987, interest rates have been falling this year.
Unlike 1987, the dollar has been strong.
And unlike 1987, the economy doesn't appear *-1 to be in any danger of overheating.
But the economy's slower growth this year also means 0 the outlook for corporate profits "isn't good," he says 0 *T*-1.
"So it's a very mixed bag."
Thus, he concludes 0 *?*, "This is not a good environment 0 *PRO* to be fully invested" in stocks *T*-2.
"If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios, I would not do any buying.
But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio, so I would look *PRO*-1 to do some modest buying" on behalf of clients . "
We're going *-2 to look for some of the better - known companies that *T*-1 got clocked *-3" Friday.
John Kenneth Galbraith.
"This is the latest manifestation of the capacity of the financial community for recurrent insanity," says *T*-1 Mr. Galbraith, an economist.
"I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion," he says *T*-1.
"The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that *T*-1 are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity.
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable."
Nevertheless, he says 0 a depression doesn't appear *-1 likely.
"There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose 0 *?*," he says.
"It takes more error *ICH*-1 now *PRO* to have a major depression than back in the Thirties--much as the financial community and the government may try *?*."
Mario Gabelli.
New York money manager Mario Gabelli, an expert at *PRO* spotting takeover candidates, says that takeovers aren't totally gone.
"Companies are still going *-2 to buy companies around the world," he says *T*-1.
Examples are "Ford looking at Jaguar, BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting."
These sorts of takeovers don't require junk bonds or big bank loans 0 *T*-2 to finance them, so Mr. Gabelli figures 0 they will continue.
"The market was up 35% since {President} Bush took office," Mr. Gabelli says 0 *?*, so a correction was *-2 to be expected *-1.
He thinks 0 another crash is "unlikely," and says 0 he was "nibbling at" selected stocks during Friday's plunge.
"Stocks that *T*-1 were thrown *-3 out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity *ICH*-4 {this} week for guys like me," he says *T*-2.
Jim Rogers.
"It seems to me that this is the pin that *T*-1 has finally pricked the balloon," says *T*-2 Mr. Rogers, a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history, Quantum Fund.
He sees "economic problems, financial problems" ahead for the U.S., with a fairly strong possibility of a recession.
"Friday you couldn't sell dollars," he says *T*-1.
Dealers "would give you a quote, but then refuse *PRO*-1 to make the trade."
If the dollar stays weak, he says 0 *?*, that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it *EXP*-2 hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much.
Mr. Rogers won't decide what *PRO* to do *T*-1 today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go *T*-2.
He recommends that investors sell takeover - related stocks, but hang on to some other stocks--especially utilities, which *T*-1 often do well during periods of economic weakness.
Frank Curzio.
Many people now claim *PRO*-1 to have predicted the 1987 crash.
Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it: He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely *-1 to decline about 500 points the following month.
Mr. Curzio says 0 what *T*-1 happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board.
If it promptly cuts the discount rate 0 it charges *T*-1 on loans to banks, he says 0 *?*, "That could quiet things down."
If not, "We could go to 2200 very soon."
Frank W. Terrizzi.
Stock prices "would still have *-1 to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks," says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Terrizzi, president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati.
Renaissance, which *T*-2 manages about $1.8 billion *U*, drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally.
Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents, primarily U.S. Treasury bills.
"T - bills probably are the right place 0 *PRO* to be *T*-1," he says *T*-2.
Quest Medical Inc. said 0 it adopted a shareholders' rights plan in which rights *PRO* to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed *-1 as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23 *T*-2.
The company said 0 the plan wasn't adopted *-1 in response to any known offers for Quest, a maker and marketer of hospital products.
The rights allow shareholders to purchase Quest stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15% of the company's common stock or announces a tender offer.
Atco Ltd. said 0 its utilities arm is considering *PRO*-1 building new electric power plants, some valued * at more than one billion Canadian dollars (US$851 million *U*), in Great Britain and elsewhere.
C.S. Richardson, Atco's senior vice president, finance, said 0 its 50.1% - owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada, and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere, including Britain, where the British government plans *PRO*-1 to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private - sector suppliers as part of its privatization program *T*-2.
"The projects are big.
They can be C$1 billion *U* plus," Mr. Richardson said *T*-1.
"But we wouldn't go into them alone," and Canadian Utilities' equity stake would be small, he said 0 *T*-1.
"Ideally, we'd like *PRO*-1 to be the operator {of the project} and a modest equity investor.
Our long suit is our proven ability *PRO* to operate" power plants, he said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Richardson wouldn't offer specifics regarding Atco's proposed British project, but he said 0 it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that *T*-2 would be formed *-1 under the country's plan *PRO* to privatize its massive water and electric utilities.
Britain's government plans *PRO*-1 to raise about #20 billion *U* ($31.05 billion *U*) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities, beginning next month.
The planned electric utility sale, scheduled * for next year, is alone expected *-1 to raise #13 billion *U*, *PRO* making it the world's largest public offering.
Under terms of the plan, independent generators would be able *PRO*-1 to compete for 15% of customers until 1994, and for another 10% between 1994 and 1998.
Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$1.16 billion *U*, mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta, where the company serves about 800,000 customers *T*-1.
"There seems *-1 to be a move *ICH*-2 around the world *PRO* to deregulate the generation of electricity," Mr. Richardson said 0 *?*, and Canadian Utilities hopes *PRO*-3 to capitalize on it.
"This is a real thrust on our utility side," he said, *PRO*-1 adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries, though he would be specific.
Canadian Utilities isn't alone in *PRO*-1 exploring power generation opportunities in Britain, in anticipation of the privatization program.
"We're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England," said *T*-1 Bruce Stram, vice president, corporate strategy and corporate planning, with Enron Corp., Houston, a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator.
Mr. Stram said 0 Enron is considering *PRO*-2 building gas - fired power plants *ICH*-4 in the U.K. capable of *PRO*-3 producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $300 million to $400 million *U*.
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly *PRO*-1 to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. .
Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long - term view.
Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that *T*-1 supposedly inhibit free trade.
He said 0 such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in *PRO* reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
But Mrs. Hills, *PRO*-1 speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective "is not *PRO* to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather *PRO* to have a blueprint for action."
She added that she expected "*-1 perhaps to have a down payment...some small step 0 *T*-2 to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest."
How such remarks translate into policy *T*-1 won't become clear for months.
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.
Many called it *PRO*-1 simply a contrast in styles.
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.
Others said 0 the Bush administration may feel 0 the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand.
And some said 0 it reflected the growing debate in Washington over *PRO* pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher's, Mrs. Hills replied: 0 "I didn't hear every word 0 he spoke *T*-4, but as a general proposition, I think 0 we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration."
Yet more than one American official who *T*-1 sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said 0 her tone often was surprisingly "conciliatory."
"I think 0 my line has been very consistent," Mrs. Hills said *T*-1 at a news conference Saturday afternoon.
"I am painted *-1 sometimes as ferocious, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes 0 *PRO* to implement *T*-2.
I don't feel very ferocious.
I don't feel either hard or soft.
I feel committed to the program of *PRO* opening markets and expanding trade."
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday *T*-1, Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in *PRO* removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted * under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.
She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified *T*-1.
But her main thrust was *PRO* to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition.
She said 0 the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled *-1 by *PRO* setting quantitative targets.
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief.
"My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said *T*-1, *PRO*-2 drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues.
"But I am relieved *PRO*-1 to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity."
Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck *-1 around 10% for years.
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as *PRO*-1 assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied *PRO*-2 making any such promise.
At one of her news conferences, Mrs. Hills said, 0 "I believe 0 we can do much better than 20%."
But she stressed, 0 "I am against managed trade.
I will not enter into an agreement that *T*-1 stipulates to a percentage of the market.
A group of Arby's franchisees said 0 they formed an association 0 *T*-1 to oppose Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's control of the restaurant chain.
The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that *T*-1 began in August.
At the time, a group called * *PRO*-3 R.B. Partners Ltd., consisting of eight of Arby's largest franchisees, offered more than $200 million *U* *PRO*-2 to buy Arby's Inc., which *T*-1 is part of DWG Corp.
DWG is a holding company controlled * by Mr. Posner.
One week later, Leonard H. Roberts, president and chief executive officer of Arby's, was fired *-1 in a dispute with Mr. Posner.
Friday, 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association--called * *PRO*-2 A.P. Association Inc.--0 *T*-1 to "preserve the integrity of the Arby's system."
The franchisees, owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby's in the U.S., said: 0 "We have concluded that continued control of Arby's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us, because it is extremely likely *-1 to cause irreparable damage to the Arby's system.
We support all efforts *PRO* to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby's Inc. and the Arby's system."
The group said 0 it would consider, among other things, *PRO* withholding royalty payments and initiating a class - action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings.
In Florida, Renee Mottram, a senior vice president at DWG, responded: 0 "We don't think 0 any individual or group should disrupt a winning system or illegally interfere with existing contractual relationships for their own self - serving motives.
A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said 0 it has made a $409 million *U* cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp.'s real - estate and shopping - center holdings.
The $409 million *U* bid includes the assumption of an estimated $300 million *U* in secured liabilities on those properties, according to those making the bid.
The group is led *-1 by Jay Shidler, chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu, and A. Boyd Simpson, chief executive of the Atlanta - based Simpson Organization Inc.
Mr. Shidler's company specializes in commercial real - estate investment and claims *PRO*-1 to have $1 billion *U* in assets; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker.
"The assets are good, but they require more money and management" than *PRO* can be provided *-1 in L.J. Hooker's current situation, said 0 *T*-2 Mr. Simpson in an interview . "
Hooker's philosophy was *PRO* to build and sell.
We want *PRO*-1 to build and hold."
L.J. Hooker, based * in Atlanta, is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is currently being managed *-1 by a court - appointed provisional liquidator.
Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee.
The $409 million *U* bid is estimated *-1 by Mr. Simpson as *PRO*-2 representing 75% of the value of all Hooker real - estate holdings in the U.S. .
Not included * in the bid are *T*-1 Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co., L.J. Hooker's department - store chains.
The offer covers the massive 1.8 million - square - foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati, the 800,000 square - foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., and the 700,000 square - foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton, Colo.
The Thornton mall opened Sept. 19 with a Bigg's hypermarket as its anchor; the Columbia mall is expected *-1 to open Nov. 15.
Other Hooker properties included * are a 20 - story office tower in midtown Atlanta, expected *PRO* to be completed *-1 next February; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio; L.J. Hooker International, the commercial real - estate brokerage company that *T*-2 once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate, plus other shopping centers.
The consortium was put *-1 together by Hoare Govett, the London - based investment banking company that *T*-2 is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp.
"We don't anticipate any problems in *PRO* raising the funding for the bid," said Allan Campbell, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett, in an interview.
Hoare Govett is acting as the consortium's investment bankers.
According to people familiar with the consortium, the bid was code - named *PRO*-2 Project Klute, a reference to the film "Klute" in which a prostitute played * by actress Jane Fonda is saved *-1 from a psychotic businessman by a police officer named *PRO* *PRO*-4 John Klute *T*-3.
L.J. Hooker was a small home - building company based * in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired *-1 *PRO*-2 to push it into commercial development *T*-3.
The company grew modestly until 1986, when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired *-1 by Australian developer George Herscu, currently Hooker's chairman *T*-2.
Mr. Herscu proceeded *PRO*-2 to launch an ambitious, but ill - fated, $1 billion *U* acquisition binge that *T*-1 included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co., as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers, a Sacramento chain; Sakowitz Inc., the Houston - based retailer, and Parisian Inc., the Southeast department - store chain.
Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company, and Mr. Simpson said 0 he resigned in 1988.
Since then, Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian's management and is currently attempting *PRO*-1 to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain.
In addition, Robert Sakowitz, chief executive of the Sakowitz chain, is seeking funds 0 *T*-1 to buy out the Hooker interest in his company.
The Merksamer chain is currently being offered *-1 for sale by First Boston Corp.
*PRO*-2 Reached *-1 in Honolulu, Mr. Shidler said that he believes 0 the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management.
"These aren't mature assets, but they have the potential 0 *PRO* to be so *T*-1," said *T*-2 Mr. Shidler.
"*PRO*-1 Managed *-2 properly, and with a long - term outlook, these can become investment - grade quality properties.
*PRO* Call it *PRO*-2 the "we're too broke *PRO*-1 to fight" defense.
Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts *PRO* to defuse suits filed * by borrowers, developers and creditors.
The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed *-1 as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money 0 *PRO* to pay judgments *T*-2.
Though the argument may have a common - sense ring to it, even the S&L lawyers concede 0 there's little precedent 0 *T*-1 to back their position.
Still, one federal appeals court has signaled 0 it's willing *PRO*-2 to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted *-1 under state law *T*-3.
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward *PRO* clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which *T*-1 topped $73 million *U* last year.
The S&L lawyers were encouraged *-1 last month by an appellate - court ruling in two cases brought * against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known * as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team.
Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch.
Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "that there will never be any assets with which *PRO* to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings *T*-1 nor any means 0 *PRO* to collect from any other party, including FSLIC *T*-2."
"If true," the court wrote *?*, "this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."
But the court said 0 it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas.
Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says 0 he plans *PRO*-2 to file a brief *ICH*-3 this week urging the district judge *PRO*-1 to dismiss the suits, because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion *U* when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 *T*-4.
"This institution is just brain dead," says *T*-1 Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm.
But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a "defense du jour."
Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says 0 a judgment for Triland could be satisfied *-1 in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch.
"We're asking the court for a number of things 0 he can grant *T*-1 in addition to the thrill of victory," he says 0 *T*-2.
"We'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize.
Canadian steel - ingot production totaled 291,890 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 7, up 14.8% from the preceding week's total of 254,280 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said 0 *T*-1.
The week's total was up 6.2% from 274,963 tons a year earlier.
The year - to - date total was 12,006,883 tons, up 7.8% from 11,141,711 tons a year earlier.
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., *PRO*-1 charging 0 they defrauded the thrift by *PRO*-2 concealing their relationship when *PRO* persuading it *PRO*-4 to buy $284 million *U* in high - yield, high - risk junk bonds *T*-3.
In a suit filed * in federal court Thursday, the S&L alleged that a "disproportionate number" of the bonds 0 it purchased *T*-1 in 1984 declined in value.
Financial Corp. purchased the bonds, the suit alleged 0 *?*, after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51% stake in the thrift for about $34 million *U*.
Vagabond Hotels was controlled *-2 by Mr. Boesky, who *T*-3 currently is serving a prison term for securities violations.
Officials at Drexel said 0 they hadn't seen the suit and thus couldn't comment.
In addition to $33 million *U* compensatory damages, the suit seeks $100 million *U* in punitive damages.
Also named *-1 in the suit is *T*-2 Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp., the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels.
Northview officials couldn't be located *-1.
Financial Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said 0 Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by *PRO*-2 purchasing the bonds.
Shortly before the visit, Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent *PRO* to acquire the 51% stake in the company.
However, the agreement was canceled *-1 in June 1984.
Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $11 million *U* in losses on them, the company said 0 *T*-1.
The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden, a great zoo, its own charming Little Italy (on Arthur Avenue) and, of course, the Yankees.
However, most people, *PRO*-3 having been subjected *-1 to news footage of the devastated South Bronx, look at the borough the way 0 Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy did *?* *T*-2 in "Bonfire of the Vanities"--as a wrong turn into hell.
But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.
In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95 *U*), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled * mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic (real oddballs like her sexpot friend, the hell - kitten Diana, age five).
Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.
She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved *-1 by steep descents into hysteria *T*-2" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.
In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working - class people lived in drab, Soviet - style buildings "glamorized" * with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways *T*-2 were decorated *-1 with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy 0 she felt *T*-1 *PRO*-2 living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: "...outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures."
*PRO*-1 Sharp - witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy.
Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself *PRO*-1 *?* in the book, really wasn't ordinary.
She was raised *-1, for the first eight years, by her mother, Rosie, whom she remembers *T*-3 as a loving liar, who *T*-2 realigned history *PRO*-4 to explain why Lily's father didn't live with them *T*-5.
Rosie reinvented this man, who *T*-1 may *RNR*-2 or may not *RNR*-2 have known about his child, as a war hero for Lily's benefit.
Rosie died *PRO*-2 young and Lily has remembered her as a romantic figure, who *T*-1 didn't interfere much with her child's education on the streets.
The games 0 Bronx children played *T*-1 (*PRO* holding kids down and stripping them, for example) seem *-2 tame by today's crack standards, but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure.
"Without official knowledge of sex or death, we flirted with both," she writes *T*-1.
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements.
Her friend Susan, whose parents *T*-1 kept reminding her 0 she was unwanted, slept on a narrow bed wedged * into her parents' bedroom, as though she were a temporary visitor.
Her friend Diana's father was a professional thief; they didn't seem *-1 to have any bedrooms at all.
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept *T*-1 and how because her own arrangements kept *-2 shifting.
When Rosie died *T*-1, her uncles moved in--and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements.
They painted the apartment *PRO*-1 orange, pink and white, according to her instructions.
With loving detail she recalls her Uncle Gabe, an Orthodox Jew and song lyricist (who *T*-1 rhymed river with liver in a love song); and Uncle Len, a mysterious part - time investigator who *T*-2 looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila envelope, *PRO*-3 like an "undercover President on a good - will mission."
They came by their strangeness honestly.
Lily's grandmother, no cookie baker, excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album, and lugged around her perennial work - in - progress, "Philosophy for Women."
The book loses some momentum toward the end, when Lily becomes more preoccupied with *PRO* dating boys and less with her delightfully weird family *T*-1.
For the most part, though, there's much pleasure in her saucy, poignant probe into the mysteries of the Babylonian Bronx.
The Bronx also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman's latest novel, which *T*-1 flashes back to the New York of the '50s.
But both the past and present worlds of "The Current Climate" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 200 pages, $18.95 *U*) feel cramped and static.
For his sixth novel, Mr. Friedman tried *PRO*-1 to resuscitate the protagonist of his 1972 work, "About Harry Towns."
Harry is now a 57 - year - old writer, whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York *T*-1 seems *-2 quaintly out - of - synch.
Harry fondly remembers the "old" days of the early '70s, when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date *PRO*-3 to analyze what Travis was doing *T*-1 wrong *T*-2.
"An L.A. solution," explains *T*-1 Mr. Friedman.
Line by line Mr. Friedman's weary cynicism can be amusing, especially when he's riffing on the Hollywood social scheme--the way 0 people size each other up, *PRO*-3 immediately canceling the desperate ones who *T*-2 merely almost made it *T*-4 *T*-1.
Harry has avoided all that by *PRO*-1 living in a Long Island suburb with his wife, who *T*-2's so addicted to soap operas and mystery novels 0 she barely seems *-3 to notice when her husband disappears for drug - seeking forays into Manhattan *T*-4.
But it *EXP*-1 doesn't take too many lines *PRO* to figure Harry out.
He's a bore.
BULL HN INFORMATION SYSTEMS Inc. is a U.S. majority - owned unit of Cie. des Machines Bull.
In Friday's edition, the name of the unit was misstated *-1.
Time magazine, in a move 0 *T*-1 to reduce the costs of *PRO* wooing new subscribers, is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year, increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways.
In an announcement to its staff last week, executives at Time Warner Inc.'s weekly magazine said 0 Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation 0 it guarantees advertisers *T*-1 by 300,000, to four million; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $4 *U* to $55 *U*.
In a related development, the news - weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said 0 it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four - color page in the magazine costs about $120,000 *U*.
However, because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered *-1, ad rates will be effectively 7.5% *ICH*-2 higher per subscriber, according to Richard Heinemann, Time associate publisher.
Time is following the course of some other mass - circulation magazines that *T*-1 in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that *PRO* maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way 0 *PRO* to draw advertisers *T*-2.
In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co.'s McCall's, and most recently News Corp.'s TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases *PRO*-1 to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers.
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of *PRO* attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news - weeklies.
But Time, as part of the more cost - conscious Time Warner, wants *PRO*-1 to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks.
Besides, Time executives think 0 *PRO* selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky.
"Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said 0 *T*-1 Mr. Heinemann.
"That perception takes the focus off the magazine."
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers.
"What we are doing *T*-2 is *PRO* screening out the readers who *T*-1 are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said *T*-3 Mr. Heinemann.
"We are trying *PRO*-1 to create quality and involvement."
However, Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million *T*-1.
And Time's paid circulation, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations, dropped 7.3% to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30, 1989.
Still, Time's move is being received *-1 well, once again.
"It *EXP*-2's terrific for advertisers to know 0 the reader will be paying more," said 0 *T*-1 Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency.
"A few drops in circulation are of no consequence.
It's not a show of weakness; they are improving the quality of circulation while *PRO*-1 insuring their profits."
Mr. Heinemann said 0 the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped *-1 away.
"The question is how much are we getting *T*-1 from each reader," said *T*-2 Mr. Heinemann.
Time's rivals news - weeklies, Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, are less reliant on electronic giveaways, and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.
Both magazines are expected *-1 to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month.
The government sold the deposits of four savings - and - loan institutions, in its first wave of sales of big, sick thrifts, but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth.
The four S&Ls were sold *-1 to large banks, as *PRO* was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated * by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created *-2 in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago.
Two of the four big thrifts were sold *-1 to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., which *T*-2 has aggressively expanded its markets, particularly in Texas and Florida.
A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank.
Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets.
These "clean - bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, *PRO*-2 to be sold *-1 later.
In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck *-1 with $4.51 billion *U* in bad assets.
Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5% to 3.7% *ICH*-2 for the deposits and branch systems, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting *T*-1.
The buyers will also be locked *-1 into deposit rates for just two weeks, as *PRO* has been the case with previous deals.
After that, the buyers may repudiate the rates paid * by the former thrifts.
But it *EXP*-1's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps.
NCNB, for example, has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market, and in Florida, rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities.
The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order *PRO*-1 to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines, but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency.
"These thrifts are beached whales," said *T*-1 Bert Ely, an industry consultant based * in Alexandria, Va.
For example, the delay in *PRO* selling People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., with $1.7 billion *U* in assets, has forced the RTC *PRO*-1 to consider selling off the thrift branch - by - branch, instead of as a whole institution.
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets.
NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association, Houston, which *T*-1 had assets of $2.8 billion *U*.
NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the RTC a premium of $129 million *U* for $3.5 billion *U* in deposits.
As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk *T*-1, the RTC will pay $3.8 billion *U* to NCNB *PRO*-2 to take $750 million *U* of bad assets.
NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., which *T*-1 had total assets of $900 million *U*.
NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $40.4 million *U* for $1.1 billion *U* in deposits.
NCNB will also acquire $266 million *U* of Freedom's assets from the RTC, which *T*-1 will require $875 million *U* in assistance.
Meridian Bancorp Inc., Reading, Pa., will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa., which *T*-1 had $2.3 billion *U* in assets.
Meridian will pay a premium of $30.5 million *U* *PRO*-1 to assume $2 billion *U* in deposits.
It will also purchase $845 million *U* of the thrift's assets, with $1.9 billion *U* in RTC assistance.
In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer, Royal Trustco Ltd., Toronto, will acquire Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif., which *T*-1 had $949 million *U* in assets.
Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $25 million *U* *PRO*-1 to assume $989 million *U* in deposits.
It will also purchase $473 million *U* in assets, and receive $550 million *U* in assistance from the RTC.
British Aerospace PLC and France's Thomson - CSF S.A. said 0 they are nearing an agreement *PRO* to merge their guided - missile divisions, *PRO*-1 greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors.
The 50 - 50 joint venture, which *T*-52 may be dubbed *-51 *PRO*-53 Eurodynamics, would have combined annual sales of at least #1.4 billion *U* ($2.17 billion *U*) and would be among the world's largest missile makers.
After two years of talks, plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance.
The companies hope for a final agreement by year - end.
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies, and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting.
In recent months, a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once - balkanized world of European arms manufacture.
Already, British Aerospace and French government - controlled Thomson - CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air - traffic control radar system.
Just last week they announced 0 they may make a joint bid *PRO* to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked * by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit.
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF--traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts--is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.
Most threatened *-2 by closer British Aerospace - Thomson ties would be *T*-1 their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.
But neither Matra nor GEC--unrelated to Stamford, Conn. - based General Electric Co.--are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces.
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that *T*-1 would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson - CSF.
Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid *T*-1 include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler - Benz AG, and France's Dassault group.
But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether *PRO*-1 to bid, the source indicated 0 *T*-2.
GEC plans first *PRO*-1 to study Ferranti's financial accounts, which auditors recently said 0 *T*-2 included #215 million *U* in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit, International Signal & Control Group, with which Ferranti merged *T*-3 last year.
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked *-1 by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense - electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry.
A consortium bid, however, would diminish GEC's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials.
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared *-2 unperturbed by the prospect of a fight with GEC for Ferranti: "Competition is the name of the game," she said *T*-1.
At least one potential GEC partner, Matra, insists 0 it isn't interested in Ferranti.
"We have nothing 0 *PRO* to say *T*-3 about this affair, which *T*-1 doesn't concern us," a Matra official said *T*-2 Sunday.
The missile venture, the British Aerospace spokeswoman said 0 *?*, is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.
For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight - fisted defense ministries; and Middle East sales, a traditional mainstay for both companies' exports, have been hurt *-1 by five years of weak oil prices.
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.
Thomson feels 0 the future of its defense business depends on *PRO*-1 building cooperation with other Europeans.
The European defense industry is consolidating; for instance, West Germany's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain's Plessey Co., and Daimler - Benz agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Messerschmitt - Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H.
In missiles, Thomson is already overshadowed *-1 by British Aerospace and by its home rival, France's Aerospatiale S.A.; *PRO*-3 to better compete, Thomson officials say 0 *?*, they need a partnership.
*PRO*-1 To justify 50 - 50 ownership of the planned venture, Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace.
Annual revenue of British Aerospace's missile business is about #950 million *U*, a Thomson spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
British Aerospace's chief missile products include its 17 - year - old family of Rapier surface - to - air missiles.
Thomson missile products, with about half British Aerospace's annual revenue, include the Crotale surface - to - air missile family.
The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans *PRO*-2 to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands.
The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit 0 ASKO plans *PRO*-1 to file *T*-2 would be the first 0 *T*-3 to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management - controlled trusts *PRO*-4 to dilute voting power of common stockholders.
Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged *-1, though unsuccessfully, ASKO's Dutch lawyers noted 0 *T*-2.
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court *PRO*-1 to overturn such a vote - diluting maneuver recently deployed * by Koninklijke Ahold NV.
ASKO says 0 the Dutch - based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds 0 *PRO* to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust *T*-1 and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders.
*PRO*-1 Speaking through its Dutch lawyers, ASKO also disclosed 0 it holds a 15% stake in Ahold.
It *EXP*-4 was previously thought *-2 0 ASKO held a 13.6% stake that *T*-3 was accumulated *-1 since July.
A spokesman for Ahold said 0 his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred - share issue.
He termed ASKO's legal actions as "unproductive" to international cooperation among European retailers.
Kenneth J. Thygerson, who *T*-2 was named *-1 *PRO*-4 president of this thrift holding company in August, resigned, *PRO*-3 citing personal reasons.
Mr. Thygerson said 0 he had planned *PRO*-1 to travel between the job in Denver and his San Diego home, but has found the commute too difficult 0 *PRO* to continue *T*-2.
A new president wasn't named *-1.
Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1% from the previous month, *PRO* pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8%, the National Institute of Statistics said 0 *T*-1 Friday.
The monthly increase is the highest recorded * in the past four years.
The index, which *T*-1 registered 156.8 at the end of September, has a base of 100 set * in 1983 and isn't seasonally adjusted *-2.
Prices have risen 5.9% in the first nine months of the year, *PRO*-1 outstripping both the initial 3% inflation goal set * by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the second, revised goal of 5.8%.
Information International Inc. said 0 it was sued *-1 by a buyer of its computerized newspaper - publishing system, alleging that the company failed *-2 to correct deficiencies in the system.
A spokesman for Information International said 0 the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks restitution of the system's about $3 million *U* purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided * by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure *PRO* to pay royalties.
Information International said 0 it believes that the complaints, *PRO*-1 filed * in federal court in Georgia, are without merit.
Closely held Morris Communications is based *-1 in Augusta, Ga.
The units that *T*-1 filed the suit are Southeastern Newspapers Corp. and Florida Publishing Co.
Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which *T*-2 *T*-1 is the most troublesome right now?
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.
Or so it must seem *T*-1 to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30 *RNR*-2 - 10 *RNR*-2 p.m. EDT).
Not only is *ICH*-1 Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup," and he's currently a man in hot water.
Here, in neutral language, is *T*-1 the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted * first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign, and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company.
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically.
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically.
He said that Jews have contributed more *ICH*-2 to black causes over the years than vice versa.
Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.
He said 0 Jews were "sick with complexes"; and he called David Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's black opponent, *PRO*-1 "a fancy shvartze with a mustache."
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language *PRO*-1 to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot?
It probably would *?*, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered *PRO*-1 to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.
For example, the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck *T*-2."
These critics fail *-3 to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that *T*-1 aims at *PRO*-5 disparaging another group, such as "Polish jokes"; and the type that *T*-2 is double - edged, *PRO*-4 aiming inward as well as outward.
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected *-1 by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of *PRO*-1 mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves.
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double - edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.
But *PRO*-2 wielded *-1 by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.
Why constructive *T*-1?
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for *PRO* easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.
That's why it *EXP*-2's dangerous *PRO* to have well - intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences *T*-1.
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook, "Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed *-1 to simmer."
The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do *?*), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means *ICH*-2 do we have *T*-1 for *PRO* letting off steam?
*PRO* Don't say 0 the TV sitcom, because that happens *-2 to be a genre that, in its desperate need *PRO* to attract everybody and offend nobody, *T*-1 resembles politics more than it does *?* comedy.
It *EXP*-1 is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue - collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show."
But these are not the differences that *T*-1 make headlines.
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart).
It *EXP*-1's worth *PRO* noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants.
At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do *?* Jackie and Maddie.
It *EXP*-1 couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup" is being made *-2 from an old recipe.
And a safe one--*PRO* imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam.
Back in the 1920s, the play and movie versions of "Abie's Irish Rose" made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author, Anne Nichols, lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain.
And it has remained there, as *PRO* evidenced *-2 by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called * *PRO*-3 "Bridget Loves Bernie," whose sole distinction *T*-1 was that it led to the real - life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney.
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all.
So far, the bubbles have been few and far between.
Part of the problem is the tendency *ICH*-1 of all sitcoms, ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear, *PRO* to preach about social issues.
To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries *PRO*-2 to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by *PRO*-3 reversing them *T*-1.
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well - paying job as a salesman in order *PRO*-1 to become a social worker.
Even more problematic is *T*-1 the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona.
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode *T*-2 and starts *PRO*-1 meting out that old - fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself *T*-2.
But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about *PRO*-1 confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade - ethnic differences.
I'm not suggesting that the producers start *-1 putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic - Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have *-1 to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer.
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason *PRO*-2 to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "*PRO* caring for other people" that *T*-1 would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.
At your age, Jackie, you ought *-2 to know that you can't make soup without *PRO*-1 turning up the flame.
When the news *ICH*-1 broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago *T*-2, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing.
"They said, ` *PRO* follow CNN,"' he told reporters *T*-1.
That shows how far Ted Turner's Cable News Network has come *T*-2 since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered *-1 the laughingstock of television news *T*-3.
It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks.
Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world.
But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau.
Although viewership soars when big news breaks *T*-1, it ebbs during periods of calm.
CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and won't keep viewers *PRO*-2 coming back as the alternatives *ICH*-1 multiply for news and information on cable - TV.
"Just the fact 0 we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin," says *T*-1 Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president, news gathering (and no relation to Ted Turner).
"You can't live on that."
So CNN, a unit of Atlanta - based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying *PRO*-2 to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a "top of mind" network.
Tonight, *PRO*-1 to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime - time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time 0 *T*-2 to air head - to - head against the network newscasts.
The show will be co-anchored *-1 by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier, a 34 - year - old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who *T*-2 has never held a job in television or journalism.
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps 0 the network is taking *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to build audience loyalty by *PRO*-3 shifting away from its current format toward more full - length "signature" programming with recognizable stars.
*PRO*-1 To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program.
It is paying higher salaries--after years of scrimping--*PRO*-1 to lure and keep experienced staffers.
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble *PRO* to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team.
"The next stage is *PRO* to get beyond the opinion leaders who *T*-1 use us as a point of reference *PRO*-3 to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says *T*-2 Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News, CNN's sister network.
But that won't be easy.
Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that *T*-1 aren't easy 0 *PRO* to change *T*-2.
It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant *PRO*-1 to spend *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially *PRO*-5 to see *T*-4.
And the cable - TV operators--CNN's distributors and part owners--like things just the way 0 they are *T*-1.
The repositioning bid is aimed *-1 at CNN's unsteady viewership--and what *T*-2 may happen to it as the cable - TV news market grows more competitive.
Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel, both of which *T*-1 are likely *-2 to pursue more general news in the future.
In addition, many cable - TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced * by local broadcast stations.
CNN wants *PRO*-1 to change its viewers' habits.
Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel - zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who *T*-1 spend an average of just 26 minutes a day *PRO*-2 watching CNN, according to audience research.
That's less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks *T*-1.
The brief attention 0 viewers give CNN *T*-1 could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable - TV channels.
CNN's viewer habits have been molded *-1 by its format.
Its strategy in the past has been *PRO* to serve as a TV wire service.
It focused on *PRO*-1 building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks.
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called * *PRO*-1 "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look.
Now, the push *ICH*-1 is on for more - distinctive shows.
"Our goal is *PRO* to create more programs with an individual identity," says *T*-1 Paul Amos, CNN executive vice president for programming.
Accordingly, CNN is adding a world - affairs show in the morning because surveys show 0 its global - news hour in the afternoon is among its most "differentiated" programs in viewers' minds, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Amos.
And it is exploring other original programs, similar to its "Larry King Live" and "Crossfire" talk shows, which executives hope 0 *T*-1 will keep people tuned * in.
Then there's "The World Today," the prime - time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier.
Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period.
But 70% of the cable - television - equipped households that *T*-1 watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered 0 *T*-2, so CNN wants in.
Mr. Amos says 0 the Shaw - Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing *-1 similar to CNN's other newcasts.
Some in the industry are skeptical.
"I find it *EXP*-2 hard *PRO* to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, *T*-3 is the same news," says *T*-1 Reuven Frank, the former two - time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley - Brinkley Report.
The evening news is also slated *-1 as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism.
In August, the network hired award - winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC.
She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who *T*-1 will produce weekly, in - depth segments, with an eye toward *PRO* breaking big stories.
CNN executives hope 0 the headlines created * by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way 0 "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS *T*-1.
That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical 0 CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of *PRO*-1 producing in - depth pieces.
"They've never shown any inclination *PRO* to spend money on production," says *T*-2 Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil - Lehrer NewsHour, who *T*-1 notes that CNN is indispensable to his job.
The network's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards, *PRO* resulting in a less - experienced work force.
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid *-1 compared with the networks.
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Mosettig: "CNN is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
But *PRO*-1 to improve, they've really got *-1 to make the investment in people."
In any case, cable - TV - system operators have reason 0 *PRO* to fear any tinkering with CNN's format *T*-1.
They market cable - TV on the very grazing opportunities 0 CNN seeks *PRO*-1 to discourage *T*-2.
"We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest, long - format programming," says *T*-2 Robert Stengel, senior vice president, programming, of Continental Cablevision Inc., which *T*-1 holds a 2% stake in Turner Broadcasting.
Ford Motor Co. said 0 it acquired 5% of the shares in Jaguar PLC.
Jaguar, the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified *-1 of the transactions, the company said 0 *T*-2.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it wouldn't raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as 15% of Jaguar shares.
The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants *PRO*-2 to buy as much as 15% of the British luxury - car maker, the maximum allowed * under current United Kingdom government restrictions.
General Motors Corp. said 0 it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began *-1 buying shares.
GM said 0 it still is talking with Jaguar about *PRO*-1 acquiring a minority interest.
If a hostile predator *ICH*-1 emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co., co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy - out attempt, an official close to the company said 0 *T*-2.
Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday's stock - market sell - off in New York and turmoil in the junk - bond market.
But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant, which *T*-1 last week named a new chief executive officer 0 *T*-2 to replace Maurice Saatchi, has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks.
Last week, Saatchi's largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, said 0 it had been approached *-1 by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring.
And Carl Spielvogel, chief executive officer of Saatchi's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit, said 0 he had offered *PRO*-1 to lead a management buy - out of the company, but was rebuffed *-1 by Charles Saatchi.
Mr. Spielvogel said 0 he wouldn't launch a hostile bid.
The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that "if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer, a crazy offer which Saatchi knew 0 it couldn't beat *T*-1, it would have no choice but *PRO* to recommend it to shareholders.
But {otherwise} it would undoubtedly come back" with an offer by management.
The executive said 0 any buy - out would be led *-1 by the current board, whose chairman *T*-2 is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force *T*-3 is believed *-4 to be Charles Saatchi.
Mr. Spielvogel isn't part of the board, nor are *?* any of the other heads of Saatchi's big U.S. - based ad agencies.
The executive didn't name any price, but securities analysts have said 0 Saatchi would fetch upward of $1.3 billion *U*.
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer *PRO*-1 only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy - back.
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive, Robert Louis - Dreyfus, who *T*-1 joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1.
Mr. Louis - Dreyfus, formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc., has a reputation as a savvy financial manager, and will be charged *-1 largely with *PRO*-2 repairing Saatchi's poor financial state.
*PRO*-3 Asked *-1 about the speculation that Mr. Louis - Dreyfus has been hired *-2 *PRO*-6 to pave the way for a buy - out by the brothers, the executive replied, "That isn't the reason 0 Dreyfus has been brought *-5 in *T*-4.
He was brought *-1 in *PRO*-2 to turn around the company."
Separately, several Saatchi agency clients said 0 they believe 0 the company's management shakeup will have little affect on them.
"It hasn't had any impact on us, nor do we expect it to *?*," said *T*-1 a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co., a major client of Backer Spielvogel.
John Lampe, director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc., a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client, said: 0 "We have no problem with the announcement, because we don't know what change it's going *-1 to bring *T*-2 about.
We aren't going *-1 to change agencies because of a change in London."
Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc., as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co., also said 0 they saw no effect.
Executives at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc., a Backer Spielvogel client that *T*-1 is reviewing its account, declined comment.
Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential - Bache was prepared *PRO*-1 to finance either a management buy - out and restructuring, or a buy - out of Backer Spielvogel alone, led * by him.

Samsung already owns Korea First Advertising Co., that country's largest agency.
Bozell joins Backer Spielvogel Bates and Ogilvy Group as U.S. agencies with interests in Korean agencies.
Alan Seelenfreund, 52 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 chairman of this processor of prescription claims, *PRO*-1 succeeding Thomas W. Field Jr., 55, who *T*-2 resigned last month.
Mr. Field also had been chairman of McKesson Corp., *PRO*-1 resigning that post after a dispute with the board over corporate strategy.
Mr. Seelenfreund is executive vice president and chief financial officer of McKesson and will continue in those roles.
PCS also named Rex R. Malson, 57, executive vice president at McKesson, as a director, *PRO*-1 filling the seat vacated * by Mr. Field.
Messrs. Malson and Seelenfreund are directors of McKesson, which *T*-1 has an 86% stake in PCS.
Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican, but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush's economic policy - making.
"There are some very significant issues out there, such as the fiscal deficit, the trade deficit, our relations with Japan, that *T*-3 have *-2 to be the subject of major initiatives," he said *T*-1 in an interview.
"I'd like *PRO*-1 to see that initiative, and I haven't *?*.
There isn't a big shot, an agenda."
A few hours later, the stock market dropped 190 points.
Politicians tried *PRO*-1 to finger each other for the blame, although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street's woes.
But Mr. Butcher's comments make one thing *ICH*-1 clear: Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy.
*PRO* Consider this:
-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight, President Bush must order $16 billion *U* of automatic, across - the - board cuts in government spending *PRO*-1 to comply with the Gramm - Rudman budget law.
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed *-1 to reach agreement on a deficit - cutting bill.
"We simply don't have strong leadership 0 *T*-2 to try *PRO*-3 to reduce the deficit and make tough choices," House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif .) said *T*-1 yesterday on NBC News's "*PRO* Meet the Press."
-- For the last two weeks, the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged *-1 in a semi-public battle over international economic policy.
The administration has been trying *PRO*-1 to push the dollar lower; the Fed has been resisting.
"One of the things that *T*-1 continues *-3 to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board," said *T*-2 Lawrence Kudlow, a Bear, Stearns & Co. economist, on ABC's "This Week."
-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers.
Last month, Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines *PRO*-1 to reduce a stake held * by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision.
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines, which *T*-1 includes a big stake by British Airways PLC *T*-2.
Some analysts say 0 uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through *T*-2--the event that *T*-1 triggered the market drop.
In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508 - point crash.
Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of *PRO*-1 taking hold.
The Treasury was locked *-1 in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve.
And concern about official actions aimed * at takeovers--then by the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department--were making markets nervous.
The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit, *PRO* resulting in a two - year plan *PRO* to reduce the deficit by more than $76 billion *U*--even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $12 billion *U* during that period.
But, barring further drops in the market this week, a similar outcome doesn't seem *-1 likely this year.
Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday's drop, by itself, isn't enough *PRO* to force both sides back to the table *PRO*-2 to try *PRO*-3 to reach a deficit - reduction agreement that *T*-1 would be more serious and more far - reaching than last spring's gimmick - ridden plan, which *T*-4 still isn't fully implemented *-5.
One of the biggest reasons that new talks aren't likely *-1 to come about *T*-2 is that, as everyone learned in 1987, the economy and the market can survive a one - day 508 - point tumble.
"Everybody thought 0 we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession," Rep. Panetta said *T*-1 yesterday in an interview.
"That did not happen.
They learned 0 they could survive it without much problem."
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta, who *T*-1 said 0 a precipitous drop this week "is going *-2 to force the president and Congress *PRO*-3 to take a much harder look at fiscal policy."
In that case, there will be plenty of blame 0 *T*-1 to go around.
"There is an underlying concern *ICH*-5 on the part of the American people--and there should be *?* - that the administration has not gone far enough in *PRO*-1 cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling *PRO*-2 to cut what the administration asked us *PRO*-4 to cut *T*-3," said *T*-6 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas).
Nevertheless, it clearly will take more than Friday's 190 - point decline *PRO* to overcome the bitter feelings that *T*-1 have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital - gains fight.
Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush's claim that the capital - gains cut was part of April's budget accord and his insistence on *PRO* combining it with the deficit - reduction legislation.
"There is no prospect of any so - called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply didn't live up to this year's deal," Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said *T*-1 yesterday on CBS News's "*PRO* Face the Nation."
During last week's maneuverings on the deficit - cutting bill and the capital - gains issue, there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds.
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal 0 *T*-1 to exclude capital gains from the deficit - reduction legislation *T*-2, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it *EXP*-3 was the president's policy *PRO* to include it.
When an agreement *ICH*-1 was reached *-3 *PRO* to strip capital gains from the legislation *T*-2, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the tax - writing Senate Finance Committee, hailed it.
*PRO*-2 Asked *-1 if the administration agreed, he curtly replied: 0 "The adminstration will have *-3 to speak for itself."
Friday's market tumble could spur action on *PRO* reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit - reduction measure, a process that *T*-1 isn't expected *-2 to begin until tomorrow at the soonest.
Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate, which *T*-1 on Friday agreed *PRO*-2 to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that *T*-4 would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit.
"The market needs a strong signal that we're serious about deficit reduction, and the best way 0 *PRO* to do that *T*-1 is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill" of similar provisions, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H .). said 0 *T*-2 yesterday.
The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations *T*-2 determine whether the Gramm - Rudman targets are met *-1, estimated that the House - passed deficit - reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion *U*, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion *U*.
Rep. Panetta said that OMB's figure would still be enough *PRO* to avoid permanent across - the - board cuts, but added: 0 "We're getting very close to the margins here."
No one in Washington was willing *PRO*-1 to take the blame for *PRO* provoking Friday's drop in the stock market.
But some players were quick *PRO*-1 to seize the moment.
Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply - side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision *PRO* to postpone action on capital gains.
"Investors, who *T*-1 had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-4, were spooked *-3," he said *T*-2.
"There have been many preposterous reasons *ICH*-1 advanced * *PRO* to support a capital - gains tax cut," Sen. Mitchell said *?* during his television appearance, "but I suggest 0 that is perhaps more than any of the others.
RJR Nabisco Inc. is disbanding its division responsible for *PRO* buying network advertising time, just a month after *PRO*-1 moving 11 of the group's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta.
A spokesman for the New York - based food and tobacco giant, taken *PRO* *PRO*-1 private earlier this year in a $25 billion *U* leveraged buy - out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit, and dismissing its 14 employees, in a move *PRO* to save money.
The spokesman said 0 RJR is discussing its network - buying plans with its two main advertising firms, FCB / Leber Katz and McCann Erickson.
"We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost," said *T*-3 the spokesman, who *T*-1 declined *PRO*-4 to specify how much RJR spends *T*-2 on network television time.
An executive close to the company said 0 RJR is spending about $140 million *U* *ICH*-1 on network television time this year, down from roughly $200 million *U* last year.
The spokesman said 0 the broadcast unit will be disbanded *-1 Dec. 1, and the move won't affect RJR's print, radio and spot - television buying practices.
The broadcast group had been based *-1 in New York until a year ago, when RJR's previous management moved it to Atlanta, the company's headquarters before this summer *T*-2.
One employee with the group said 0 RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because "there was supposed *-1 to be a future."
He said 0 the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks, *PRO*-1 wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies.
The RJR spokesman said 0 the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of *PRO*-1 purchasing ad time for the networks' upcoming season.
"The studies {on *PRO* closing the unit} couldn't be completed *-1 until now," he said *T*-2.
The group's president, Peter Chrisanthopoulos, wasn't in his office Friday afternoon *PRO*-1 to comment.
On a recent Saturday night, in the midst of West Germany's most popular prime - time show, a contestant bet the host that she could name any of 100 different cheeses after just one nibble, while *PRO*-2 blindfolded *-1.
The woman won the bet.
But *PRO* perhaps even more remarkable, the three - hour - show, "Wetten Dass" (*PRO* Make a Bet), regularly wins the top slot in the country's TV ratings, *PRO*-1 sometimes drawing as many as 50% of West German households.
As the 1992 economic integration approaches, Europe's cultural curators have taken to the ramparts against American "cultural imperialism," *PRO*-1 threatening *PRO*-2 to impose quotas against such pop invaders as "Dallas," "Miami Vice" and "L.A. Law."
But much of what the Europeans want *PRO*-2 to protect *T*-1 seems *-5 every bit as cheesy as what they are trying *PRO*-3 to keep *T*-4 out.
The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who *T*-2 have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of Europe's TV shows be produced *-1 in Europe.
So far, the French have failed *-1 to win enough broad - based support *PRO* to prevail.
A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why.
While there are some popular action and drama series, few boast the high culture and classy production values 0 one might expect *T*-1.
More European air time is filled *-1 with low - budget game shows, variety hours, movies and talk shows, many of which *T*-2 are authorized knock - offs of their American counterparts.
One of France's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar - school classmates for on - air reunions.
A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending *PRO* to be Italian.
One of Italy's favorite shows, "Fantastico," a tepid variety show, is so popular that viewers clamored *PRO*-3 to buy a chocolate product, "Cacao Fantastico," whose praises *T*-2 were sung *-1 each week by dancing showgirls--even though the product didn't exist.
*PRO*-1 Topping the cheese stunt, on another typical evening of fun on "Wetten Dass," a contestant won a bet *ICH*-2 with the show's host, Thomas Gottschalk, that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone.
A celebrity guest, U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Richard Burt, also won a bet that someone could pile up $150 *U* worth of quarters on a slanted coin.
Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost, *PRO*-1 agreeing *PRO*-2 to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister Hans - Dietrich Genscher *PRO*-3 frying and selling their combined weight in potato pancakes.
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which *PRO* to raise the protectionist barriers *T*-2, it may be because these shows need all the protection 0 they can get *T*-1.
European programs usually target only their own local audience, and often only a small portion of that.
Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain, and almost never show up on U.S. screens.
Attempts *PRO* to produce "pan-European" programs have generally resulted in disappointment.
One annual co-production, the three - hour - long "Eurovision Song Contest," featuring soft - rock songs from each of 20 European countries, has been described *-1 as the world's most boring TV show.
Another, "Jeux Sans Frontieres," where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves *PRO*-1 performing pointless tasks *T*-2, is a hit in France.
A U.S. - made imitation under the title "Almost Anything Goes" flopped fast.
For the most part, what *T*-1's made *-2 here stays here, and for good reason.
The cream of the British crop, the literary dramas that *T*-2 are shown *-1 on U.S. public television as "Masterpiece Theater," make up a relatively small part of British air time.
Most British programming is more of an acquired taste.
There is, for instance, "One Man and His Dog," a herding contest among sheep dogs.
Also riveting to the British are *T*-1 hours of dart - throwing championships, even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons.
European drama has had better, though still mixed, fortunes.
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns.
A French knock - off of "Dallas," called * *PRO*-3 "Chateauvallon" and set * in a French vineyard, had a good run in France, which *T*-2 ended after the female lead was injured *-1 in a real - life auto accident.
"Schwarzwaldklinik," (Black Forest Clinic), a kind of German "St . Elsewhere" set * in a health spa, is popular in Germany, and has spread into France.
Italy's most popular series is a drama called * *PRO*-2 "La Piovra," or "The Octopus," which *T*-1 chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia.
It was front - page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned *-2 down in the series *T*-1.
Spain's most popular mini-series this year was "Juncal," the story of an aging bullfighter.
"The trend is pretty well established *-1 now that local programs are the most popular, with American programs second," says *T*-2 Brian Wenham, a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp.
"Given a choice, everybody will watch a home - produced show."
But frequently there isn't much choice.
Thus, Europe has begun the recent crusade 0 *T*-1 to produce more worthy shows of its own, programs with broader appeal.
"We've basically got *-4 to start from scratch, to train writers and producers *PRO*-5 to make shows that other people will want *PRO*-2 to see *T*-3," concedes *T*-1 Colin Young, head of Britain's National Film Theatre School.
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the bane of television, here many believe that its absence is *PRO*-1 to blame *-2 for the European TV industry's sluggish development.
Until recently, national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising.
Since production costs were guaranteed *-2, it *EXP*-3 didn't matter that a program couldn't be sold *-4 abroad or put *-4 into syndication, as most American programs are *?* *-1.
But not much money was spent *-1 on the shows, either, a situation that *T*-2 encouraged cheap - 0 *PRO* to - make *T*-4 talk and game shows, while *PRO*-3 discouraging expensive - 0 *PRO* to - produce *T*-5 dramas.
Now, however, commercial channels are coming to most European countries, and at the same time, satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly.
Just last week, Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time; Spain earlier began *-1 to allow commercial television alongside its state channels.
The result is a new and huge appetite for programming.
But perhaps to the consternation of those calling for quotas, most of this void is likely *-2 to be filled *-1 with the cheapest and most plentiful programming now available--reruns--usually of shows made * in the U.S. .
Sky Channel, a British - based venture of Australian - American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch, offers what *T*-1 must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience.
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made *PRO* available cheaply from its boss's other ventures.
In a Madrid hotel room recently, a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, *PRO*-2 only to be urged *-6 by the British announcer *PRO*-3 to "stay *PRO*-4 tuned *-5 for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo."

It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. .
The Cincinnati consumer - products giant got clobbered *-1 two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called * *PRO*-4 Attack, which *T*-2 quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets *T*-3.
"They don't want *PRO*-2 to get caught *-3 again," says *T*-1 one industry watcher.
Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say 0 P&G's new powdered detergent--0 *T*-2 to be called *-1 *PRO*-3 Cheer with Color Guard--will be on shelves in that market by early November.
A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month.
She said 0 the company will study results from this market before *PRO*-1 expanding to others.
Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G.
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after *PRO*-1 watching the success of Attack.
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 *T*-1, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.
With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated *-1 to be 12%.
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion *U* U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow *T*-1 and liquids have gained prominence over powders *T*-1.
The company may have chosen *PRO*-1 to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best - selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach.
With superconcentrates, however, it *EXP*-1 isn't always easy *PRO* to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend *-2 to dump too much detergent into the washing machine, *PRO*-2 believing that it *EXP*-3 takes a cup of powder *PRO* to really clean the laundry.
In the early 1980s, P&G tried *PRO*-2 to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets *T*-1 in Europe.
But the product, which *T*-1 wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped *-2.
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly *PRO*-1 to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches, but they haven't sold well, despite the convenience.
But P&G contends 0 the new Cheer is a unique formula that *T*-1 also offers an ingredient that *T*-2 prevents colors from *PRO*-3 fading.
And retailers are expected *-1 to embrace the product, in part because it will take up less shelf space.
"When shelf space was cheap *T*-1, bigger was better," says Hugh Zurkuhlen, an analyst at Salomon Bros.
But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case.
If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely *-1 to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates.
Then retailers "will probably push the {less - established} brands out altogether," he says 0 *T*-1.
Competition is bound *PRO*-1 to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. .
*PRO* To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time *PRO* taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which *T*-2 has about 23% of the market.
Kao officials previously have said 0 they are interested in *PRO*-1 selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand - lotion maker.
It also has a product - testing facility in California.
Some believe 0 P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese.
"This is something 0 P&G would do *T*-1 with or without Kao," says *T*-2 Mr. Zurkuhlen.
James Robinson, 57 years old, was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives.
He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp., a division of North American Philips Corp., itself a subsidiary of N.V . Philips of the Netherlands.
Charles J. Lawson Jr., 68, who *T*-1 had been acting chief executive since June 14, will continue as chairman.
The former president and chief executive, Eric W. Markrud, resigned in June.
While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought - induced peaks of 1988, wheat prices remain stubbornly high.
And they're likely *-1 to stay that way for months 0 *T*-2 to come, analysts say 0 *T*-3.
For one thing, even with many farmers planting more winter wheat *ICH*-2 this year than last, tight wheat supplies are likely *-3 to support prices well into 1990, the analysts say 0 *T*-1.
And if rain doesn't fall soon across many of the Great Plains' wheat - growing areas, yields in the crop now being planted * could be reduced *-1, *PRO* further squeezing supplies.
Also supporting prices are *T*-1 expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months.
By next May 31, stocks of U.S. wheat 0 *T*-2 to be carried over into the next season--before the winter wheat now being planted * is harvested *-1--are projected *-3 to drop to 443 million bushels.
That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s.
Stocks were 698 million bushels on May 31 of this year.
In response to dwindling domestic supplies, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said 0 the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres 0 farmers can plant *T*-1 in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments.
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels.
It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels, compared with this year's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought - stunted 1.81 billion in 1988.
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted * won't be felt *-1 until the second half of next year.
Until then, limited stocks are likely *-1 to keep prices near the $4 *U* - a - bushel level, analysts say 0 *T*-2.
On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.0675 *U* a bushel, unchanged.
In theory at least, tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market *PRO*-2 susceptible to a supply - demand squeeze, said *T*-1 Daniel Basse, a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago.
Such a situation can wreak havoc, as *PRO* was shown *-1 by the emergency that *T*-2 developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade.
In July, the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. *PRO*-1 to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans.
The exchange said 0 it feared that some members wouldn't be able *PRO*-2 to find enough soybeans *PRO* to deliver and would have *-2 to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate, which *T*-1 had refused requests *PRO* to reduce its holdings.
Ferruzzi has denied 0 it was trying *PRO*-1 to manipulate the soybean futures market.
Unseasonably hot, dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat - growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening *PRO*-1 to reduce the yield from this season's winter wheat crop, said 0 *T*-2 Conrad Leslie, a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago.
For example, in the Oklahoma panhandle, 40% or more of the topsoil is short of moisture.
That figure climbs to about 47% in wheat - growing portions of Kansas, he said 0 *T*-1.
The Soviet Union hasn't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans, but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months, *PRO* further supporting prices.
"Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand" in coming weeks, predicted 0 *T*-1 Richard Feltes, vice president, research, for Refco Inc. in Chicago.
*PRO* Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
Orange Juice Traders will be watching *PRO*-2 to see how long and how far the price decline that *T*-1 began Friday will go *T*-3.
Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what *T*-91 would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989 - 90 Florida orange crop.
It was near the low range of estimates, at 130 million 90 - pound boxes, compared with 146.6 million boxes last season.
However, as *PRO* expected *-1, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $1.34 *U* a pound from around $1.55 *U*.
Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had *T*-1 and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time.
It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $1.3210 *U* a pound.
Brazilian juice, after a delay caused * by drought at the start of its crop season, is beginning *-1 to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities.
Brazil wants *PRO*-2 to stimulate demand for its product, which *T*-1 is going *-3 to be in plentiful supply.
The price cut, one analyst said 0 *?*, appeared *-3 to be aimed *-1 even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen *T*-4.
It's a dollar - priced product, and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe, the analyst said 0 *T*-1.
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $2 *U* a pound at midyear.
Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely *-1 to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak *T*-3, the analyst said 0 *T*-2.
Energy
Although some analysts look for profit - taking in the wake of Friday's leap in crude oil prices, last week's rally is generally expected *-1 to continue this week.
"I would continue *-1 to look for a stable crude market, at least in futures" trading, said *T*-2 William Hinton, an energy futures broker with Stotler & Co.
Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $20.89 *U* a barrel, up 42 cents on the day.
On European markets, meanwhile, spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel.
"This market still wants *PRO*-2 to go higher," said *T*-1 Nauman Barakat, a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
He predicted that the November contract will reach $21.50 *U* *ICH*-1 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
There has been little news 0 *T*-1 to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets.
Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes.
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell *?*.
Many traders foresee a tightening of near - term supplies, particularly of high - quality crudes such as those produced * in the North Sea and in Nigeria.
The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60 - year history of calm, right up through Friday.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock - market decline "doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy."
"The economy," he added 0 *?*, "remains well - balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth."
*PRO* Sound familiar?
Here's *T*-2 what Ronald Reagan said *T*-1 after the 1987 crash: "The underlying economy remains sound.
There is nothing wrong with the economy...all the indices are up."
*PRO* Heard that before?
After the 1929 crash, Herbert Hoover said: 0 "The fundamental business of the country...is on a sound and prosperous basis.
Syms Corp. completed the sale of its A. Sulka & Co. subsidiary, a men's luxury haberdashery, to Luxco Investments.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
As Syms's "core business of off - price retailing grows, a small subsidiary that *T*-1 is operationally unrelated becomes a difficult distraction," said *T*-2 Marcy Syms, president of the parent, in a statement.
A spokeswoman said 0 Sulka operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas.
Syms operates 25 off - price apparel stores in the U.S. .
Ports of Call Inc. reached agreements *PRO* to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that *T*-2 weren't disclosed *-1.
The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes 0 the travel company has sold *T*-1 this year as part of a restructuring.
The company said 0 a portion of the $32 million *U* realized * from the sales will be used *-1 *PRO* to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended air - charter operations.
Earlier the company announced 0 it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs.
Population Drain Ends For Midwestern States
IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.
So are *T*-1 Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s.
The gains, *PRO* to be sure, are rather small.
Iowa, for instance, saw its population grow by 11,000 people, or 0.4%, between 1987 and 1988, the Census Bureau says 0 *T*-1.
Still, even that modest increase is good news for a state that *T*-1 hadn't grown at all since 1981.
Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest 0 *T*-1 to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980--Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race.
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980, including New York, which *T*-1 lost 4% of its population during the 1970s.
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade, they are growing again.
At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround.
Seven states that *T*-1 grew in the early 1980s are now losing population--West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Alaska.
Overall, though, the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest, and fast - growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue.
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started *-1 narrowing.
More Elderly Maintain Their Independence
THANKS TO modern medicine, more couples are growing old together.
And even after *PRO*-1 losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent.
A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 *ICH*-1 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970.
This doesn't mean 0 they're less likely *-1 to live alone, however.
That share has remained at about 24% since 1970.
What *T*-1 has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.
In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 *ICH*-1 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970.
As people get even older, many become widowed.
But even among those aged 75 and older, the share living with a spouse rose slightly, to 40% in 1988 from 38% in 1970.
Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely *-1 to live with other relatives.
Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970.
The likelihood of *PRO* living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%.
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially.
Careers Count Most For the Well - to - Do
MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family.
At least that's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich, Clancy, Shulman indicates *T*-1.
Two - thirds of respondents said 0 they strongly felt the need *PRO* to be successful in their jobs, while fewer than half said 0 they strongly felt the need *PRO* to spend more time with their families.
*PRO* Being successful in careers and spending the money 0 they make *T*-1 are top priorities for this group.
Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich.
Average household income for the sample was $194,000 *U*, and average net assets were reported *-1 as $775,000 *U*.
The goal was *PRO* to learn about one of today's fastest - growing income groups, the upper - middle class.
Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one - third of discretionary income.
Across the board, these consumers value quality, buy what they like *T*-2 rather than just what they need *T*-3, and appreciate products that *T*-1 are distinctive.
Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one - fourth don't feel that they have made it.
Twenty percent don't even feel 0 they are financially well off.
Many of the affluent aren't comfortable with themselves, either.
About 40% don't feel 0 they're more able than others.
While twothirds feel some guilt about *PRO*-1 being affluent, only 25% give $2,500 *U* or more to charity each year.
Thirty - five percent attend religious services regularly; at the same time, 60% feel that in life one sometimes has *-1 to compromise one's principles.
Odds and Ends
THE NUMBER of women and minorities who *T*-1 hold jobs in top management in the nation's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978.
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47% of officials and managers in the top 50 banks, up from 33% in 1978.
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16% from 12%....
Per - capita personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The amount of income divvied * up for each man, woman and child was $16,489 *U* *ICH*-1 in 1988, up 6.6% from $15,472 *U* in 1987.
Per capita personal income ranged from $11,116 *U* in Mississippi to $23,059 *U* in Connecticut....
There are 13.1 million students in college *ICH*-1 this fall, up 2% from 1988, the National Center for Education Statistics estimates 0 *T*-2.
About 54% are women, and 44% are part - time students.
The U.S., which *T*-1 is finalizing its steel - import quotas, is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which *T*-2 have relatively unsubsidized steel industries.
Meanwhile, the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan's steel quota, and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community.
Brazil, similar to Mexico and South Korea, is expected *-2 to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had * under the previous five - year steel quotas, which *T*-1 expired Sept. 30.
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that *T*-1 haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990.
In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used * annually by the nation.
Of the remaining 20% needed *, the steel - quota negotiations allocate about 15% *T*-3 to foreign suppliers, with the difference supplied *-4 mainly by Canada--which *T*-2 isn't included *-1 in the quota program.
Other countries that *T*-1 don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel.
Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that *T*-1 are similar to quotas.
The Bush administration earlier this year said 0 it would extend steel quotas, known * as voluntary restraint agreements, until March 31, 1992.
It also said 0 it would use that two - and - a - half year period *PRO*-2 to work toward an international consensus on *PRO* freeing up the international steel trade, which *T*-1 has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected *-3 by governments.
The U.S. termed its plan, *PRO*-1 a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension.
Mexico, which *T*-1 was one of the first countries 0 *T*-2 to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.
South Korea, which *T*-1 had 1.9% under the previous quotas, is set *PRO*-2 to get a small increase to about 1.95%.
That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean - U.S. steel project is included *-1.
Meanwhile, Brazil is expected *-2 to increase its allowance from the 1.43% share 0 it has had *T*-1 in recent years.
The EC and Japan--the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers--haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.
The EC steel industry, which *T*-1 has been coping with strong European demand, has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.
Japan has been shipping steel 0 *T*-1 to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%.
In the recent talks, the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons, to 7% of the U.S. market from 6.7% in 1988.
But its quota has been as high as 6.9% in 1984.
Japan, however, has agreed *PRO*-1 to cut its quota to about 5% from 5.9% previously.
Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported * to the U.S. under the quota program.
The balance is supplied *-1 by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela.
The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market 0 *PRO* to give *T*-1 to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.
That was essentially made *-1 up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from *PRO* cutting Japan's allowance.
Negotiators from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1% of the U.S. steel market 0 *PRO* to allocate *T*-1 *T*-2.
These optional 1% - a - year increases to the steel quota program are built *-1 into the Bush administration's steel - quota program *PRO* to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers 0 *PRO* to try *PRO*-2 to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries *T*-3.
The Bush administration, *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, is questioning whether Italy's Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets.
Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export - control policies *T*-2, are expected *-3 to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting 0 *T*-4 to be held *-1 in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.
They plan *PRO*-1 to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools, computers and other high - technology products.
But the Bush administration says 0 it wants *PRO*-1 to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before it will support further liberalization.
*PRO*-2 To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government *PRO*-3 to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer - driven devices that *T*-1 could be used *-4 *PRO* to build parts for combat aircraft.
The London Sunday Times, which *T*-1 first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $25 million *U* in "embargoed, state - of - the - art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry."
Olivetti reportedly began *-1 shipping these tools in 1984.
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined *PRO*-1 to confirm any details.
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week.
Olivetti has denied that it violated Cocom rules, *PRO*-2 asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed *-1 by the Italian authorities.
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question, the disclosure couldn't be better timed *-2 *PRO* to support the position of export - control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community.
"It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting," said *T*-1 a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export - control policies, *PRO* reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.
Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods *T*-1.
But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc *T*-1.
However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization.
"There's no evidence that the Soviet program 0 *T*-2 to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished," said *T*-1 a State Department spokesman.
Interprovincial Pipe Line Co. said 0 it will delay a proposed two - step, 830 million Canadian - dollar (US$705.6 million *U*) expansion of its system because Canada's output of crude oil is shrinking.
Interprovincial, Canada's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S., said 0 revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day *ICH*-2 by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.
Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day *ICH*-1 during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level.
"The capability of existing fields 0 *T*-1 to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas, said 0 *T*-2 Ronald Watkins, vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial's parent, Interhome Energy Inc.
Mr. Watkins said 0 volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected *-1 to fall further, *PRO* making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s.
"There has been a swing of the pendulum back to the gas side," he said *T*-1.
Many of Canada's oil and gas producers say 0 the outlook for natural gas is better than it is *?* for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration," said *T*-1 Robert Feick, manager of crude oil with Calgary's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
Mr. Watkins said 0 the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.
Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced * in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.
Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports *T*-3 to the U.S. is transported *-1 on Interprovincial's system, whose main line *T*-2 runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said 0 *T*-1 John Lichtblau, president of the New York - based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
That ranks Canada as the fourth - largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.
Mr. Lichtblau said 0 Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast - shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help *PRO* intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.
"It's very much a growing concern.
But when something is inevitable *T*-1, you learn *PRO*-2 to live with it," he said *T*-3.
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited *-1 in any case by Canada's falling output.
Under terms of its proposed two - step expansion, which *T*-1 would have required regulatory approval, Interprovincial intended *PRO*-2 to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system, beginning with a modest expansion by 1991.
The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day.
The Senate's decision *PRO* to approve a bare - bones deficit - reduction bill without a capital - gains tax cut still leaves *PRO*-1 open the possibility of *PRO* enacting a gains tax reduction this year.
Late Friday night, the Senate voted 87 - 7 *PRO*-1 to approve an estimated $13.5 billion *U* measure that *T*-2 had been stripped *-8 of hundreds of provisions that *T*-9 would have widened, rather than narrowed, the federal budget deficit.
Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill *PRO*-1 to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special - interest tax breaks and spending increases.
"We're putting a deficit - reduction bill back in the category of *PRO* being a deficit - reduction bill," said *T*-1 Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn .).
But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills *ICH*-2 would soon be moving through Congress that *T*-4 could carry some of the measures that *T*-1 had been cast *-3 aside, including a capital - gains tax cut.
In addition, the companion deficit - reduction bill already passed * by the House includes a capital - gains provision.
House - Senate negotiations are likely *-1 to begin at midweek and last for a while.
"No one can predict exactly what *T*-1 will happen on the House side," said *T*-2 Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan .).
But, he added 0 *?*, "I believe 0 Republicans and Democrats will work together *PRO*-2 to get capital - gains reform this year."
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration wouldn't push *PRO*-1 to keep the capital - gains cut in the final version of the bill.
"We don't need this as a way 0 *PRO* to get capital gains *T*-2," he said *T*-1.
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif .) said in an interview, 0 "If that's the signal that *T*-1 comes from the White House, that will help a great deal."
The Senate's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital - gains tax cut less certain this year.
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said 0 he was "confident" that any House - Senate agreement on the deficit - reduction legislation wouldn't include a capital - gains tax cut.
And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax legislation originates *T*-2, said 0 there aren't any "plans *PRO* to produce another tax bill that *T*-1 could carry a gains tax cut this year."
One obvious place 0 *PRO* to attach a capital - gains tax cut, and perhaps other popular items stripped * from the deficit - reduction bill, *T*-1 is the legislation 0 *T*-2 to raise the federal borrowing limit.
Such legislation must be enacted *-1 by the end of the month.
The Senate bill was pared *-1 back in an attempt *PRO* to speed deficit - reduction through Congress.
Because the legislation hasn't been completed *-1, President Bush has until midnight tonight *PRO*-2 to enact across - the - board spending cuts mandated * by the Gramm - Rudman deficit - reduction law.
Senators hope that the need *PRO* to avoid those cuts will pressure the House *PRO*-1 to agree to the streamlined bill.
The House appears *-1 reluctant *PRO*-2 to join the senators.
A key is whether House Republicans are willing *PRO*-1 to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues' decision *PRO* to drop many pet provisions.
"Although I am encouraged *-1 by the Senate action," said *?* Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill .) of the House Ways and Means Committee, "it *EXP*-4 is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved *-2 in the upcoming conference with the Senate."
Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks *T*-1.
He has been resisting a stripped - down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital - gains tax cut.
But Republican senators saw no way 0 *PRO* to overcome a procedural hurdle *T*-1 and garner the 60 votes needed * *PRO* to win the capital - gains issue on the floor *T*-1, so they went ahead with the streamlined bill.
The Senate bill was stripped *-1 of many popular, though revenue - losing, provisions, a number of which *T*-2 are included *-3 in the House - passed bill.
These include a child - care initiative and extensions of *PRO* soon - to - expire tax breaks for low - income housing and research - and - development expenditures.
Also missing from the Senate bill is *T*-2 the House's repeal of a law, called * *PRO*-3 Section 89, that *T*-1 compels companies *PRO*-4 to give rank - and - file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives.
One high - profile provision that *T*-1 was originally in the Senate bill but was cut *-3 out because it lost money was the proposal *ICH*-2 by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee *PRO* to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
Mr. Bentsen said 0 he hopes 0 the Senate will consider that measure soon.
To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed * by the Finance Committee that *T*-1 would have overhauled the entire physician - reimbursement system under Medicare.
To the detriment of many low - income people, efforts *PRO* to boost Medicaid funding, especially in rural areas, also were stricken *-1.
*PRO*-3 Asked *-1 why senators were giving up so much *T*-2, New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said, 0 "We're looking like idiots.
Things had just gone too far."
Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator.
It worked, others said 0 *?*, because there were no exceptions: all revenue - losing provisions were stricken *-1.
The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that *T*-1 would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced *-2 *T*-3.
In addition, the bill dropped a plan *PRO* to make permanent a 3% excise tax on long - distance telephone calls.
It no longer includes a plan that *T*-2 would have repealed what *T*-3 remains of the completed - contract method of accounting, which *T*-4 is used *-1 by military contractors *PRO* to reduce their tax burden.
It also drops a provision that *T*-1 would have permitted corporations *PRO*-3 to use excess pension funds *PRO*-2 to pay health benefits for current retirees.
Also stricken *-3 was *T*-2 a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties, which *T*-1 would have raised $65 million *U* in fiscal 1990.
A provision that *T*-2 would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised *-1.
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell, who *T*-1 had proposed the streamlining.
Mr. Mitchell's relations with Budget Director Darman, who *T*-3 pushed for a capital - gains cut to be added *-4 to the measure, have been strained since Mr. Darman chose *PRO*-2 to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill.
The deficit reduction bill contains $5.3 billion *U* in tax increases in fiscal 1990, and $26 billion *U* over five years.
The revenue - raising provisions, which *T*-7 affect mostly corporations, would:
-- Prevent companies that *T*-8 have made leveraged buy - outs from *PRO*-1 getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused * by interest payments on debt issued * *PRO* to finance the buy - outs, effective Aug. 2, 1989.
-- Require mutual funds *PRO*-1 to include in their taxable income dividends paid * to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received *-4 *T*-2, effective the day after the tax bill is enacted *-5.
-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans *ICH*-3, effective June 6, 1989, that *T*-1 has been exploited *-6 by investment bankers in corporate takeovers.
The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given * to banks on the interest from loans used * *PRO* to acquire securities for an ESOP, if the ESOP owns less than 30% of the employer's stock.
-- Curb junk bonds by *PRO* ending tax benefits for certain securities, such as zero - coupon bonds, that *T*-1 postpone cash interest payments.
-- Raise $851 million *U* by *PRO* suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes.
-- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies, effective August 1990.
-- Impose a tax on ozone - depleting chemicals, such as those used * in air conditioners and in Styrofoam, beginning at $1.10 *U* a pound starting next year.
-- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding.
-- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly, effective next year.
-- Restrict the ability *ICH*-1 of real estate owners *PRO* to escape taxes by *PRO*-2 swapping one piece of property for another instead of *PRO*-3 selling it for cash.
-- Increase to $6 *U* a person from $3 *U* the international air - passenger departure tax, and impose a $3 *U* - a - person tax on international departures by commercial ships.
The measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees.
Among its provisions:
-- Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $2.8 billion *U*, in part by *PRO* curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians.
The plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year.
-- Removal of the U.S. Postal Service's operating budget from the federal budget, *PRO* reducing the deficit by $1.77 billion *U*.
A similar provision is in the House version.
-- Authority for the Federal Aviation Administration to raise $239 million *U* by *PRO*-1 charging fees for commercial airline - landing rights at New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airports, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington.
-- Increases in Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees totaling $54 million *U*.
-- Direction *ICH*-2 to the U.S. Coast Guard *PRO*-1 to collect $50 million *U* from users of Coast Guard services.
-- Raising an additional $43 million *U* by *PRO* increasing existing Federal Communications Commission fees and penalties and establishing new fees for amateur radio operators, ship stations and mobile radio facilities.

Weatherford International Inc. said 0 it canceled plans for a preferred - stock swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock, and added that it expects *PRO*-1 to publicly offer about 10 million common shares.
The company said 0 it planned *PRO*-1 to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding.
The exchange ratio was never established *-1.
Weatherford said 0 market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange.
The energy - services concern said, however, that in January 1990, it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock.
Weatherford suspended its preferred - dividend payment in October 1985 and said 0 it hasn't any plans *PRO* to catch up on dividends in arrears about $6 million *U*, but will do so some time in the future.
Additionally, the company said 0 it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock, expected * to be offered *-1 in November.
The company said 0 Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., underwriters for the offering, were granted *-1 an option *PRO* to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares *PRO*-2 to cover over - allotments.
Proceeds will be used *-1 *PRO* to eliminate and restructure bank debt.
Weatherford currently has approximately 11.1 million common shares outstanding.
Investors who *T*-1 bought stock with borrowed money--that is, "on margin"--may be more worried than most following Friday's market drop.
That's because their brokers can require them *PRO*-3 to sell some shares or put up more cash 0 *T*-2 to enhance the collateral backing their loans.
In October 1987, these margin calls were thought *-1 to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market.
Typically, a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75% of its original value *T*-1.
If the investor doesn't put up the extra cash 0 *T*-1 to satisfy the call, the brokerage firm may begin *-2 liquidating the securities.
But some big brokerage firms said 0 they don't expect major problems as a result of margin calls.
Margin calls since Friday "have been higher than usual, but reasonable," a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said 0 *T*-1.
Merrill Lynch & Co. officials "don't expect {margin calls} to be as big a factor as in 1987" because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin, a spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp., the San Francisco - based discount brokerage firm, said 0 he didn't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers.
He said 0 Schwab had increased margin requirements "so customers have more of a cushion."
He added: "We learned a lesson *ICH*-1 in 1987 about volatility.
MedChem Products Inc. said 0 a U.S. District Court in Boston ruled that a challenge by MedChem to the validity of a U.S. patent held * by Pharmacia Inc. was "without merit."
Pharmacia, based * in Upsala, Sweden, had charged in a lawsuit against MedChem that MedChem's AMVISC product line infringes on the Pharmacia patent.
The patent is related to hyaluronic acid, a rooster - comb extract used * in eye surgery.
In its lawsuit, Pharmacia is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction 0 *T*-1 to block MedChem from *PRO*-2 selling the AMVISC products.
A MedChem spokesman said 0 the products contribute about a third of MedChem's sales and 10% to 20% *U* of its earnings.
In the year ended Aug. 31, 1988, MedChem earned $2.9 million *U*, or 72 cents a share, on sales of $17.4 million *U*.
MedChem said 0 the court's ruling was issued *-1 as part of a "first - phase trial" in the patent - infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case.
It said 0 it is considering "all of its options *ICH*-1 in light of the decision, including a possible appeal."
The medical - products company added that it plans *PRO*-1 to "assert its other defenses" against Pharmacia's lawsuit, including the claim that it hasn't infringed on Pharmacia's patent.
MedChem said that the court scheduled a conference for next Monday--*PRO*-1 to set a date for proceedings on Pharmacia's motion for a preliminary injunction.
Diamond Shamrock Offshore Partners said 0 it had discovered gas offshore Louisiana.
The well flowed at a rate of 2.016 million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16 64 - inch opening at depths between 5,782 and 5,824 feet.
Diamond Shamrock is the operator, with a 100% interest in the well.
Diamond Shamrock Offshore's stock rose 12.5 cents Friday *PRO*-1 to close at $8.25 *U* in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Pension funds, insurers and other behemoths of the investing world said 0 they began *-1 scooping up stocks during Friday's market rout.
And they plan *PRO*-1 to buy more today.
Rightly or wrongly, many giant institutional investors appear *-2 to be fighting the latest war by *PRO*-3 applying the lesson 0 they learned *T*-1 in the October 1987 crash: *PRO* Buying at the bottom pays off.
*PRO* To be sure, big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today.
They could still panic and bail out of the market.
But their 1987 performance indicates that they won't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse.
"Last time, we got rewarded *-3 for *PRO*-4 going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst *T*-5," said *T*-2 John W. Rogers, president of Chicago - based Ariel Capital Management Inc., which *T*-1 manages $1.1 billion *U* of stocks.
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for "our favorite stocks that *T*-1 have fallen apart."
He expects *PRO*-2 to invest the rest if the market weakens further.
Denver - based portfolio manager James Craig wasn't daunted *-2 when Friday's rout shaved $40 million *U* from the value of the $752 million *U* Janus Fund 0 he oversees *T*-1 *T*-3.
"I waited *PRO*-2 to make sure 0 all the program trades had kicked through," he said *T*-1.
Then he jumped into the market:
"I spent $30 million *U* in the last half - hour."
Other money managers also opened their wallets.
"I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know 0 we're getting good value," said *T*-1 Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn.
"There is no justification *ICH*-1 on the fundamental level for this crash."
Unlike mutual funds, which *T*-1 can be forced *-2 *PRO*-7 to sell stockholdings when investors rush *PRO*-4 to withdraw money *T*-3, big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide *PRO*-5 to ride out market storms without *PRO*-6 jettisoning stock.
Most often, they do just that, because stocks have proved *-1 to be the best - performing long - term investment, *PRO*-2 attracting about $1 trillion *U* from pension funds alone.
"If you bought after the crash, you did very very well off the bottom," said *T*-1 Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer of Chicago - based Kemper Financial Services Inc.
The $56 billion *U* California Public Employees Retirement System, for one, added $1 billion *U* to its stock portfolio two years ago.
"The last crash taught institutional investors that they have *-2 to be long - term holders, and that they can't react to short - term events, good or bad," said *T*-1 Stephen L. Nesbitt, senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
"Those that *T*-1 pulled out (of stocks) regretted it," he said *?*, "so I doubt 0 you'll see any significant changes" in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday's decline.
Stocks, as *PRO*-1 measured *-2 by the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index, have been stellar performers this year, *PRO*-1 rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.
Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades.
"You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market," said *T*-1 James D. Awad, president of New York - based BMI Capital Corp.
Mr. Awad, however, worries that the market "could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days.
It can happen before you can turn around."
He said 0 he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading.
"The only thing 0 you don't have *T*-1," he said *?*, "is the ` portfolio insurance' phenomenon overlaid * on the rest."
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which *T*-1 is widely thought *-2 to have worsened the 1987 crash.
*PRO*-1 Not really insurance, this tactic was designed *-1 *PRO*-3 to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by *PRO*-2 selling waves of S&P futures contracts.
In its severest test, the $60 billion *U* of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected.
Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday, money managers said 0 *T*-1.
Neil Weisman, whose New York - based Chilmark Capital Partners *T*-4 had converted 85% of its $220 million *U* investment pool to cash in recent months, said 0 he was besieged *-3 by Wall Street firms *ICH*-1 Friday asking him *PRO*-2 to take stock off their hands.
"We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want *PRO*-2 to make bids on anything," said *T*-1 Mr. Weisman, who, *PRO*-4 happy with his returns on investments chalked * up earlier, *T*-3 declined the offers.
Mr. Weisman predicts 0 stocks will appear *-1 to stabilize in the next few days before *PRO*-1 declining again, *PRO*-2 trapping more investors.
"I think 0 it will be a rigor mortis rally," he said *T*-1.
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles *T*-1 had put them at odds with the market rally.
Especially gleeful were *T*-3 the short sellers, who *T*-2 have been pounded *-1 by this year's market climb.
The shorts sell borrowed shares, *PRO*-1 hoping *PRO*-2 to profit by *PRO*-3 replacing them later at a lower price.
The nation's largest short - selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif., which *T*-1 said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point.
All that now has changed.
"We're ahead for the year because of Friday," said *T*-1 the firm's Kurt Feshbach.
"We're not making a killing, but we had a good day.
The Treasury plans *PRO*-1 to raise $175 million *U* in new cash Thursday by *PRO*-2 selling about $9.75 billion *U* of 52 - week bills and redeeming $9.58 billion *U* of maturing bills.
The bills will be dated *-1 *PRO*-2 Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25, 1990.
They will be available in minimum denominations of $10,000 *U*.
Bids must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the Arcadian Phosphate case did not repudiate the position 0 Pennzoil Co. took *T*-1 in its dispute with Texaco, contrary to your Sept. 8 article "Court Backs Texaco's View in Pennzoil Case--Too Late."
The fundamental rule of contract law applied * to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend *PRO*-2 to be bound *-1 *T*-3.
In the Pennzoil / Texaco litigation, the courts found 0 Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended *PRO*-3 to be bound *-1; in Arcadian Phosphates they found 0 there was no intention *PRO* to be bound *-2.
Admittedly, the principle in the cases is the same.
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts.
And the facts, as *PRO* found *-1 by the various courts in these two lawsuits, were different.
When you suggest otherwise *T*-1, you leave the realm of reporting and enter the orbit of speculation.

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said 0 Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application *PRO* to buy five Valley Federal branches, *PRO*-1 leaving the transaction in limbo.
The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp., whose spokesman *T*-1 said 0 the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because of an informal notice that Imperial's thrift unit failed *-2 to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
The Community Reinvestment Act requires savings and loan associations *PRO*-3 to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received *-1 *T*-2.
The transaction, *PRO*-1 announced *-2 in August, included about $146 million *U* in deposits at the five outlets in California's San Joaquin Valley.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1, but Valley Federal had said 0 it expected *-2 to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $2 million *U* in operating costs annually.
Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether *PRO*-2 to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp., which *T*-1 said 0 it is attempting *PRO*-3 to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements.
Valley Federal, with assets of $3.3 billion *U*, is based *-1 in Van Nuys.
Imperial Corp., based * in San Diego, is the parent of Imperial Savings & Loan.
In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $33.1 million *U*.
It was Friday the 13th, and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points.
Just a coincidence?
Or is triskaidekaphobia--fear of the number 13--justified?
In academia, a so - called Friday the 13th effect has been set *-1 up and shot *-1 down by different professors.
Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez, professors of finance at the University of Miami, found evidence that the market is spooked *-1 by Friday the 13th.
But their study, which *T*-87 spanned the 1962 - 85 period, has since been shown *-1 to be jinxed *-86 by an unlucky choice of data.
In the '70s, the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you - know - what.
But the date tends *-1 to be a plus, not a minus, for stocks, according to Yale Hirsch, a collector of stock market lore.
Another study found that the 82 Fridays the 13th in the 1940 - 1987 period had higher than average returns--higher even than Fridays in general, which *T*-1 tend *-2 to be strong days for stock prices.
On the only other Friday the 13th this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points.
Professor Kolb says 0 the original study, titled * *PRO*-2 Friday the 13th, Part VII, was published *-1 tongue - in - cheek.
In a similar vein, he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday's full moon could have played a part, too, in Friday's market activity.
In response to your overly optimistic, outdated piece on how long unemployment lasts *T*-1 (People Patterns, Sept. 20): I am in the communications field, above entry level.
I was laid *-1 off in August 1988, and after a thorough and exhausting job search, was hired *-1 in August 1989.
My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies.
The statistics quoted * by the "new" Census Bureau report (garnered * from 1984 to 1986) are out of date, certainly as an average for the Northeast, and possibly for the rest of the country.
I think 0 what *T*-1 bothered me most about the piece was that there seemed *-2 to be an underlying attitude *PRO* to tell your readers 0 all is well--if you're getting laid *-3 off *PRO* don't worry, and if you're unemployed, it's a seller's market.
*PRO*-1 To top it off, you captioned the graph showing the average number of months in a job search as "Time Off."
Are you kidding?
*PRO* Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life--and is *?* for most people.
Your paper needs a serious reality check.

This small Dallas suburb's got trouble.
Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool.
More than 30 years ago, Prof. Harold Hill, the con man in Meredith Willson's "The Music Man," warned the citizens of River City, Iowa, against the game.
Now kindred spirits on Addison's town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the Grand Kempinski, from *PRO*-1 installing three free pool tables in its new lounge.
Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said 0 they were worried about *PRO* setting a precedent that *T*-1 would permit pool halls along Addison's main street.
And the mayor, in an admonition that *T*-1 bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill's, warned that "alcohol leads to betting, which *T*-2 leads to fights."
The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim 0 *T*-2 has been maligned *-1 unjustly for years.
"Obviously they're not in touch with what *T*-2's going on," says *T*-1 Tom Manske, vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association.
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago, he insists 0 *?*, where "upscale, suit - and - tie places" are adding tables *T*-3.
With today's tougher drunk driving laws, he adds 0 *?*, "people don't want *PRO*-2 to just sit around and drink."
Besides, rowdy behavior seems *-2 unlikely at the Grand Kempinski, where rooms average $200 *U* a night *T*-1 and the cheap mixed drinks go for $3.50 *U* a pop *T*-1.
At the lounge, manager Elizabeth Dyer won't admit patrons in jeans, T - shirts or tennis shoes.
But a majority of the Addison council didn't buy those arguments.
*PRO* Introducing pool, argued 0 *?* Councilwoman Riley Reinker, would be "dangerous.
It would open a can of worms."
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either.
After its previous mayor committed suicide last year, an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects, gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town's coffers for trips and retreats.
The revelations embarrassed town officials, although they argued that the problems weren't as severe as the media suggested 0 *?*.
Now comes the pool flap.
"I think 0 there's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous," Councilman John Nolan says *T*-1.

Moody's Investors Service said 0 it reduced its rating on $165 million *U* of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift, *PRO*-1 citing turmoil in the market for low - grade, high - yield securities.

FRANKLIN SAVINGS ASSOCIATION (Ottawa, Kan.) --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it downgraded its rating *ICH*-1 to B - 2 from Ba - 3 on less than $20 million *U* of this thrift's senior subordinated notes.
The rating concern said 0 Franklin's "troubled diversification record in the securities business" was one reason for the downgrade, *PRO*-1 citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries.
"They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these," said *T*-1 Franklin President Duane H. Hall.

There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday.
When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today *T*-1, the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure.
For the first time, the 83 - year - old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.
This role reversal holds *PRO*-1 true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens.
But are these four players, three of them in their 80s, ready *PRO*-1 to assume a different role after 88 years, collectively, of service on the high court?
Every indication is that the four are prepared *PRO*-1 to accept this new role, and the frustrations that *T*-5 go with it, but in different ways.
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear *-1 philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear *-2 fighting mad.
The four justices are no newcomers to dissent, *PRO*-1 often joining forces in the past decade *PRO*-2 to criticize the court's conservative drift.
But always, in years past, they have bucked the trend and have been able *PRO*-1 to pick up a fifth vote *PRO*-2 to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases.
Now, however, as the court's new five - member conservative majority continues *-1 to solidify, victories for the liberals are rare.
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided * by the court.
Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions, with the contentious flag - burning ruling as his only big victory.
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, *PRO*-1 strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech.
"Each time 0 the court revisits an issue *T*-2, the justices will be forced *-1 by a dissent *PRO*-4 to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said *T*-3.
Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s *T*-1, he knew that the tables might turn in the future.
He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt *T*-2, a reference to the late conservative justice who *T*-1 was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court's opinions.
Associates of 81 - year - old Justice Marshall say 0 he was "depressed" about the court's direction last spring, but is feisty about his role and determined *PRO*-1 to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights.
"We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going *-1 to do it," he said *T*-2 in a speech last month.
He, *PRO*-2 like Justice Brennan, considers dissents highly important for the future, a point that *T*-1 hasn't escaped legal scholars.
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says 0 there is a "generation - skipping" flavor to current dissents.
The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says 0 *?*, appeared *-2 to be writing for the short - term, *PRO* suggesting that the court's direction might change soon.
"Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says *T*-1.
Justice Blackmun, who *T*-1 will turn 81 next month, also seems *-2 feisty about his new role.
Associates say 0 he takes some defeats *ICH*-1 more personally than his colleagues, especially attempts *PRO* to curtail the right to abortion first recognized * in his 1973 opinion, Roe vs. Wade.
Friends and associates who *T*-1 saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said 0 he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years.
And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August.
But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.
He concluded his remarks by *PRO*-1 quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on Washington.
Justice Stevens, 69, is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role, in part because he may be the least liberal of the four, but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of *PRO* arguing with the majority more than the others.
If the role 0 these four dissenters are assuming *T*-1 is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history, it also differs in an important way from recent history, court watchers say 0 *T*-2.
"The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited *T*-1," says 0 *?* Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School, "but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created *T*-2.
September's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists, and the pessimism over interest rates caused * by the new price data contributed to the stock market's plunge Friday.
After *PRO*-1 falling for three consecutive months, the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9% last month, the Labor Department reported 0 *?* Friday, as energy prices jumped after *PRO*-2 tumbling through the summer.
Although the report, which *T*-2 was released *-1 before the stock market opened, didn't trigger the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, analysts said 0 it did play a role in the market's decline.
Analysts immediately viewed the price data, the grimmest inflation news in months, as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely *-1 to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped 0 *?*.
*PRO*-2 Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient *PRO* to keep the Fed from *PRO*-1 easing credit, the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5% in September, to $145.21 billion *U*.
That rise came on top of a 0.7% gain in August, and suggested 0 there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy.
"I think 0 the Friday report, combined with the actions of the Fed, weakened the belief that there was going *-2 to be an imminent easing of monetary policy," said *T*-1 Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled * by the new numbers.
"The overall 0.9% increase is serious in itself, but what *T*-1 is even worse is that excluding food and energy, the producer price index still increased by 0.7%," said *T*-2 Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers.
But Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis, blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump.
"I would say 0 this is not bad news; this is a blip," he said *T*-1.
"The core rate is not really out of line."
All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which *T*-1 measures changes in the prices 0 producers receive *T*-2 for goods.
Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run - up in world oil prices sent the index *PRO*-2 surging at double - digit annual rates *T*-1.
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer, *PRO* causing the index to decline for three consecutive months.
Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year, the Labor Department said 0 *T*-1.
While *PRO* far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988.
Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after *PRO*-2 plunging 7.3% in August *T*-1.
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, *PRO* leaving the future pace of inflation *PRO*-1 uncertain.
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index, but the 0.9% climb was higher than most anticipated 0 *?*.
"I think 0 the resurgence {in inflation} is going *-2 to continue for a few months," said *T*-1 John Mueller, chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon, a Washington economic forecasting firm.
He predicted 0 that inflation will moderate next year, *PRO*-1 saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world - wide.
But Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler - Distributors, said that last month's rise "isn't as bad an omen" as the 0.9% figure suggests 0 *?*.
"If you examine the data carefully, the increase is concentrated *-1 in energy and motor vehicle prices, rather than *PRO* being a broad - based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods," he explained *T*-2.
Passenger car prices jumped 3.8% in September, after *PRO*-1 climbing 0.5% in August and declining in the late spring and summer.
Many analysts said 0 the September increase was a one - time event, *PRO*-1 coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models.
Although all the price data were adjusted *-1 for normal seasonal fluctuations, car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase.
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1% in September, while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1%.
Food prices declined 0.6%, after *PRO*-1 climbing 0.3% in August.
Meanwhile, the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8% in September to $32.82 billion *U*.
But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices, analysts said 0 *T*-1.
Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7% after *PRO*-1 declining 0.6% in August, while sales of building materials fell 1.8% after *PRO*-2 rising 1.7%.
Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4% in September, after *PRO*-1 dropping for three consecutive months.
Prices for crude goods, an array of raw materials, jumped 1.1% after *PRO*-1 declining 1.9% in August and edging up 0.2% in July.
Here are *T*-1 the Labor Department's producer price indexes (1982 = 100) for September, before seasonal adjustment, and the percentage changes from September, 1988.
*PRO* Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, alleging:
1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial "Kangaroo Committees" was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading.
I thought 0 your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative.
2 . That Mr. Lantos supported the rights *ICH*-1 of the witnesses *PRO* to take the Fifth Amendment.
Yes, he did.
As I watched him on C - Span, I heard 0 him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights, which he quotes *T*-1 from the transcript of the hearings.
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution.
He used about 56 words *PRO*-1 defending the witnesses' constitutional rights.
Unfortunately, by my rough guess, he used better than 5,000 words *PRO*-1 heaping scorn on the witnesses for *PRO*-2 exercising the Fifth.
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary.
As your editorial rightly pointed out, Samuel Pierce, former HUD secretary, and Lance Wilson, Mr. Pierce's former aide, "are currently being held *-1 up to scorn for *PRO*-1 taking the Fifth Amendment.
" That certainly is not the supposed "distorted reading" indicated * by Mr. Lantos.
3 . That his "committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD.
My colleagues and I fully realize 0 we are not a court...etc."
Absolute rubbish.
By any "reasonable man" criterion, Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted.
Apparently, their verdict is in.
Right now they're pursuing evidence.
That's not a bad way 0 *PRO* to proceed *T*-1, just somewhat different from standard American practice.
How was that practice referred to *-1 *T*-3 when I was in school *T*-2?
Ah, yes, something called * *PRO*-1 a Star Chamber.
Of course, Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change.
No doubt 0 that's partially true.
Everything that Mr. Lantos says *T*-1 in his letter is partially true.
He's right about his subcommittee's responsibilities when it comes to *PRO* obtaining information from prior HUD officials *T*-1.
But if his explanation of motivation is true, why is his investigation so oriented *-2 as *PRO*-2 to identify criminal activity *T*-1?
Why not simply questions designed *PRO* to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency?
Such as, what *T*-1 happened when Congress wanted *PRO*-4 to know about $400 *U* toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost *T*-2 *T*-3?
No, Mr. Lantos's complaints simply won't wash.
4 . That the Journal defends "the sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public that *T*-1 took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD," etc. and so forth.
No, to my mind, the Journal did not "defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence - peddling and abuse of the public trust ..."
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense.
The problem, which the Journal so rightly pointed *T*-1 out in a number of articles, is not the likes of Mr. Lantos, who *T*-2 after all is really a bit player on the stage, but the attempt *ICH*-3 by Congress *PRO* to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary / judicial body.
(Of course, we've also got a judiciary that *T*-1 seeks the same objective.)
The system is the problem, not an individual member.
Individuals can always have their hands slapped *-1.
It's when such slapping doesn't occur *T*-1 that we've got trouble *T*-2.
I do not by any means defend HUD management.
But I think 0 the kind of congressional investigation that *T*-2 has been pursued *-1 is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency (and, yes, maybe criminality) within HUD could possibly generate *?*.
The last time 0 I saw a similar congressional hearing *T*-1 was when "Tail Gunner Joe" McCarthy did his work *T*-2.
Raymond Weber
Parsippany, N.J.
I disagree with the statement *ICH*-2 by Mr. Lantos that one should not draw an adverse inference against former HUD officials who *T*-1 assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against self - incrimination in congressional hearings.
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person "shall be compelled *-1, in any criminal case, *PRO*-2 to be a witness against himself."
This privilege against self - incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who *T*-3 chooses not *PRO*-1 to testify.
Thus, in a criminal case, a prosecutor cannot comment on a defendant's failure *PRO* to testify nor can the defendant be compelled *-1 *PRO*-3 to take the stand as a witness, thus *PRO* forcing him *PRO*-2 to "take the Fifth."
The privilege, however, has been limited *-1 in accordance with its plain language *PRO* to protect the defendant in criminal matters only.
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that "the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed *-1 by a party to a civil cause *T*-2."
Baxter v. Palmingiano, 425 U.S. 308 (1976).
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called *-1 as a witness, he may be forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.
*PRO* Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based *-2 on a constitutional right *PRO* to refuse *PRO*-3 to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter *T*-4, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used *-1 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant *PRO*-1 to testify.
Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after *PRO*-2 presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel *T*-3, one must conclude that he held a good - faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used *-1 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.
The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right *PRO* to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help *PRO* convict him of a crime.
*PRO* Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self - incrimination.

*PRO* Don't jump yet.
The stock market's swoon may turn out *-1 to be good news for the economy.
In one wild hour of trading, the market managed *PRO*-1 to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying *PRO*-2 to do *T*-3, unsuccessfully, for weeks.
It is forcing the Federal Reserve *PRO*-1 to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar.
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business--indeed, the entire economy.
This may sound strangely optimistic.
After all, until a few years ago, the stock market was viewed *-1 as a barometer of the national economy.
When it went down *T*-1, by all tradition, the economy followed.
That has changed, partly because the two years following the worst stock - market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable.
The 1987 crash was "a false alarm however you view it *T*-1," says 0 *T*-2 University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz.
The market seems *-1 increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation.
Its spasms can't be traced *-1 to fundamental business conditions, nor do they appear *-2 to presage major shifts in the economy.
"The market today has a life of its own," John Akers, chairman of International Business Machines Corp., said *T*-1 Saturday.
"There's nothing rational about this kind of action."
Of course, the health of the economy will be threatened *-1 if the market continues *-2 to dive this week.
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth, damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies *T*-1 for financial sustenance.
The financial - services industry was battered *-1 by the 1987 crash.
What *T*-1's more, although the stock market is far less overvalued *ICH*-2 today than two years ago, the U.S. economy is weaker.
Growth is slower.
Profits are softer.
Debt burdens are heavier.
But if the stock market doesn't continue *-1 to plummet, the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate.
The Fed, which *T*-1 until Friday had been resisting moves 0 *T*-2 to ease credit, is now poised *PRO*-3 to pour money into the economy if *PRO* needed *-4 *PRO* to soothe the markets.
Fed officials may protest that this doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest - rate policies.
But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests 0 the Fed is likely *-1 to bring down short - term interest rates in its effort *PRO* to calm markets.
*PRO*-1 Anticipating the Fed's move, money traders lowered a key interest rate known * as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625% *ICH*-2 late Friday, down from 8.820% the day before.
Tiny movements in the rate, which *T*-1 is what banks charge each other *T*-3 for overnight loans, are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves *T*-2 on the monetary markets.
The dollar also began *-2 to decline Friday as the stock market's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire *PRO* to invest in the U.S. .
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals, *PRO*-2 threatening *PRO*-3 to extinguish the export boom that *T*-1 has sustained manufacturers for several years.
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar.
A modest drop in the dollar--only a modest one, *PRO* mind you--would be welcomed *-1 by the U.S. .
That wasn't the case in 1987, when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse, *PRO* producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. *T*-1.
Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 isn't so comforting.
In the third quarter of 1987, the economy spurted at an inflation - adjusted annual rate of 5.3%.
The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3% in the third quarter of 1989, which *T*-1 ended two weeks ago.
The plunge in stock prices "is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down *T*-1," says 0 *T*-2 economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting company.
"A lot of pent - up demand is gone."
Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987--"but only slightly and for a short period of time," recalls 0 *T*-1 Mr. Zarnowitz, a longtime student of business cycles.
"That was offset *-1 by strength elsewhere.
{The effects} were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected 0 *?*.
" Today, he frets *?*, exports and business investment spending may be insufficient *PRO*-2 to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction.
What *T*-1's more, the corporate borrowing binge hasn't abated in the past two years.
"We've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt...just at the time when earnings are being squeezed *-1 *T*-3," Mr. Chimerine notes *T*-2.
The more a company relies on borrowed money, the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown.
A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court.
The Fed, of course, knows that very well--hence its readiness *PRO* to pump credit into the economy this morning.
But, in the process, the Fed risks *PRO*-1 reigniting inflation.
Even before Friday's events, Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed won't be able *PRO*-1 to live up to its tough words on *PRO* eliminating inflation because of its responsibility *PRO* to protect fragile financial markets, banks and highly leveraged corporations.
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now isn't recession, he reasons 0 *T*-1; it's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation.
In the end, the 1987 collapse suggested 0 *?*, the economy doesn't move in lockstep with stock prices.
The economy does, however, depend on the confidence of businesses, consumers and foreign investors.
A panic on Wall Street doesn't exactly inspire confidence.
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday.
A 190 - point drop isn't likely *-1 to make much of a dent; *PRO* multiply that a few times over, though, and it will *?*.
If the reactions of executives gathered * Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled *-1 by Friday's decline.
And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious--well, the dollar's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it.
On the bottom line, the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we've been through this before.
Two years ago, about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression.
The doomsayers had a receptive audience.
The prosperity that *T*-1 followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today.
At the very least, the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation's success in *PRO* handling the last go - around.
As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) observed yesterday, "The Fed avoided a meltdown last time.
They are more sophisticated this time.
Ideal Basic Industries Inc. said 0 its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for HOFI North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with Ideal in a transaction that *T*-1 will leave Ideal's minority shareholders with 12.8% of the combined company.
HOFI, the North American holding company of Swiss concern Holderbank Financiere Glaris Ltd., previously proposed *PRO*-1 combining its 100% stake in St. Lawrence Cement Inc. and its 60% stake in Dundee Cement Co. with its 67% stake in Ideal.
But HOFI's first offer would have given Ideal's other shareholders about 10% of the combined company.
Ideal's directors rejected that offer, although they said 0 they endorsed the merger proposal.
Under the agreement, HOFI will own 87.2% of the combined company.
Ideal's current operations will represent about 39.2% of the combined company.
The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by Ideal shareholders.
Ideal said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to complete the transaction early next year.

Britain's retail price index rose 0.7% in September from August and was up 7.6% for the year, the Central Statistical Office said 0 *T*-1.
Avis Inc., *PRO*-1 following rival Hertz Corp.'s lead, said 0 it is backing out of frequent - flier programs with three airlines.
The Garden City, N.Y., car - rental company said 0 it won't renew contracts with NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit, Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year.
But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines.
Industry estimates put Avis's annual cost of all five programs at between $8 million and $14 million *U*.
A spokesman for Avis wouldn't specify the costs but said 0 the three airlines being dropped * account for "far less than half" of the total.
Budget Rent a Car Corp., of Chicago, and National Car Rental Systems Inc., of Minneapolis, both said 0 they had no plans *PRO* to follow suit.
In fact, Budget indicated 0 it saw some benefit to *PRO*-1 staying involved in these programs, in which renters earn frequent - flier miles *T*-2 and fliers can get car - rental discounts *T*-2.
"I cannot see how this news by Hertz and Avis cannot benefit Budget's programs *T*-2," said *T*-1 Bob Wilson, Budget's vice president, marketing planning.
Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements *T*-1.
National also participates in the Northwest frequent - flier program along with four other airlines, including Delta and USAir Group Inc.'s USAir unit.
A month ago, Hertz, of Park Ridge, N.J., said that it would drop its marketing agreements *ICH*-1 at year end with Delta, America West and Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines, and that pacts with American Airlines, UAL Inc's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended *-2...sometime after Dec. 31.
At the time, Hertz said 0 its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $20 million *U* and that the value of redeemed awards topped $15 million *U*.
Analysts and competitors, however, doubt 0 the numbers were that high.
Budget said 0 its frequent - flier costs are "substantially below" Avis's level.
Robert D. Cardillo, Avis vice president of marketing, said, 0 "The proliferation and costs attached * to {frequent - flier programs} have significantly diminished their value."
This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis, said 0 *T*-1 Charles Finnie, car - rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons.
"They've been looking *PRO*-2 to get their costs down, and this is a fairly sensible way 0 *PRO* to do it *T*-3," he said *T*-1.
General Motors Corp., in a series of moves that *T*-2 angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada, has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles *PRO*-1 to cut its excess vehicle - making capacity.
In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.
GM is under intense pressure *PRO* to close factories that *T*-1 became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.
The company, *PRO*-1 currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed 0 it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.
Just a month ago, GM announced 0 it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility 0 *T*-1 to close since 1987.
Now, GM appears *-1 to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation *PRO*-2 to get in shape for the 1990s.
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that *T*-1 are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match *?*.
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled 0 they want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that *T*-2 will be negotiated *-1 next year.
GM officials want *PRO*-1 to get their strategy 0 *PRO* to reduce capacity and the work force *T*-2 in place before those talks begin.
The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying *PRO*-2 to silence dissidents who *T*-1 charge 0 the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs *T*-3.
Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who *T*-2 recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement *ICH*-1 Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.
The auto maker's decision *PRO* to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness *PRO* to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said 0 *T*-1.
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves: Production of full - sized vans will be consolidated *-1 into a single plant in Flint, Mich.
That means 0 two plants--one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio--probably will be shut *-1 down after the end of 1991.
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.
Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown *PRO*-1 to criticize the U.S. - Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that *T*-1 affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec.
Workers at plants in Van Nuys, Calif., Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Mich., were told *-1 0 their facilities are no longer being considered *-2 to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars.
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro - Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese, Quebec, company and union officials said 0 *T*-1.
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City *PRO*-1 uncertain about their futures.
The Van Nuys plant, which *T*-1 employs about 3,000 workers, doesn't have a product 0 *PRO* to build *T*-2 after 1993.
Jerry Shrieves, UAW local president, said 0 the facility was asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to draw up plans *PRO* to continue *-4 working as a "flex plant," which *T*-1 could build several different types of products on short notice *PRO*-5 to satisfy demand.
At the Oklahoma City plant, which *T*-1 employs about 6,000 workers building the eight - year - old A - body mid-sized cars, Steve Featherston, UAW local vice president, said 0 the plant has no new product lined *-3 up, and "0 none of us knows" when the A - body cars will die *T*-2.
He said 0 he believes 0 GM has plans *PRO* to keep *-1 building A - body cars into the mid-1990s.
At Pontiac, however, the Camaro - Firebird decision appears *-1 to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that *T*-2 last built the plastic - bodied, two - seater Pontiac Fiero model.
The Fiero plant was viewed *-3 as a model of union - management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company *PRO*-4 to close the factory last year.
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result.
Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor - management cooperation's failure.
The oil industry's middling profits could persist through the rest of the year.
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected *-1 to report much less robust earnings than they did *?* for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability.
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely *-1 to remain weak, industry executives and analysts say 0 *?*, *PRO* reducing chances that profits could equal their year - earlier performance.
The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals," Glenn Cox, president of Phillips Petroleum Co., said 0 *T*-1 in an interview.
"That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general, he added 0 *T*-1.
He didn't forecast Phillips's results.
But securities analysts say 0 Phillips will be among the companies hard - hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third - quarter earnings.
So, too, many analysts predict 0 *?*, will *?* *T*-1 Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp.
Typical is *T*-2 what *T*-1 happened to the price of ethylene, a major commodity chemical produced * in vast amounts by many oil companies.
It has plunged 13% since July to around 26 cents a pound.
A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents, *PRO*-1 peaking at about 34 cents last December.
A big reason for the chemical price retreat is overexpansion.
Beginning in mid-1987, prices began *-1 accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand.
Companies added capacity furiously.
Now, greatly increased supplies are on the market, while the dollar is stronger, and domestic economic growth is slower.
Third - quarter profits from gasoline were weaker.
"Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year," said *T*-1 William Randol, a securities analyst at First Boston Corp.
Oil company refineries ran flat out *PRO*-2 to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that *T*-1 didn't materialize.
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period.
In addition, crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier, *PRO* further pressuring profitability.
Refiners say 0 margins picked up in September, and many industry officials believe 0 gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.
During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits.
Crude oil production may turn out *-2 to be the most surprising element of companies' earnings this year.
Prices--*PRO*-1 averaging roughly $2 *U* a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier--have stayed well above most companies' expectations.
Demand has been much stronger than *PRO* anticipated *-1, and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter.
"We could see higher oil prices this year," said *T*-1 Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
That will translate into sharply higher production profits, particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $13 *U* a barrel in the fourth quarter *T*-1.
While oil prices have been better than *PRO* expected *-1, natural gas prices have been worse.
In the third quarter, they averaged about 5% less than they were *?* in 1988.
The main reason remains weather.
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that *T*-1 caused utilities to burn more natural gas *PRO*-2 to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use.
This summer, on the other hand, had milder weather than usual.
"We've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices," said *T*-1 Mr. Cox, Phillips's president.
"The lagging gas price is not going *-1 to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 0 *?*."
*PRO*-1 Going into the fourth quarter, natural gas prices are anywhere from 8% to 17% *U* lower than a year earlier.
For instance, natural gas currently produced * along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $1.47 *U* a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from $1.69 *U* a thousand cubic feet a year ago.
CBS Inc. is cutting "The Pat Sajak Show" down to one hour from its current 90 minutes.
CBS insisted 0 the move wasn't a setback for the program, which *T*-1 is the network's first entry into the late - night talk show format since 1972.
"I have every intention of *PRO*-4 making this the best possible show and *PRO* having it run one hour is the best way to it," said *T*-3 Rod Perth, who *T*-2 was named *-1 *PRO*-5 vice president of late night entertainment in August.
"This will raise the energy level of the show."
CBS will continue *-1 to program action - adventure shows 0 *T*-2 to follow the Sajak hour.
But CBS News will extend its four - hour "Nightwatch" by 30 minutes and begin at 1:30 a.m.
The show, despite a promising start, has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as *PRO* compiled *-1 by A.C. Nielsen Co., *PRO*-2 finishing far below "Tonight" on NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., and "Nightline" on ABC - TV, a unit of Capital Cities / ABC Inc.
Further fractioning the late - night audience is *T*-1 the addition of the "Arsenio Hall Show," syndicated * by Paramount Communications Inc.
It all seemed *-1 innocent enough: Last April, one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here, identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company's new cassette players for children.
"It is almost identical to the Sony product," Mr. Iken remarked *T*-1, after *PRO*-2 seeing prototypes and pictures.
Replied a Justin salesman: "Exactly."
The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40% below those of Sony Corp. of Japan's "My First Sony" line.
The visitor waxed *PRO* enthusiastic and promised *PRO*-1 to return.
But instead of a new customer--part of a hoped - for bonanza from *PRO* underselling Sony--Justin got a costly legal morass *T*-1.
Mr. Iken, it turned out *?*, was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder *PRO* to gather information for Sony.
His recording later turned up as a court exhibit.
*PRO*-2 Seeking *PRO*-1 to keep Justin's "My Own" product line off the U.S. market, Sony last May filed a suit *ICH*-3 in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement, unfair competition and other violations of business law.
Since then, life has changed a lot for 61 - year - old Leonard Kaye, Justin's owner.
"I haven't been able *PRO* to get a decent night's sleep since this has been going on," he says *T*-1.
"It's the most distracting thing in my life--I can't even attend to my business."
His company (annual sales: about $25 million *U*) may suffer a costly blow--*PRO* losing an estimated 10% of total sales--if Sony (annual sales: about $16 billion *U*) prevails.
Justin's plight shows what *T*-1 can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational *T*-2.
With considerable irony, the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business *T*-1.
Americans used *-1 to complain bitterly about *PRO*-1 being undersold by *PRO* look - alike products from Japan.
Now Sony, whose innovative, premium - priced products *T*-1 are among the most admired in consumer electronics, is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap *PRO* look - alike produced * in China.
"The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants *PRO*-3 to stop it," says *T*-2 Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who *T*-1 previously guarded Rubik's Cube.
(Sony itself declines *PRO*-1 to comment.)
If Sony wins, Mr. Eslinger says 0 *?*, its little rival will have *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to sell the products overseas.
At worst, he adds *?*, "They'd have *-2 to grind them all up and throw them away."
Mr. Kaye denies the suit's charges and says 0 his only mistake was *PRO* taking on Sony in the marketplace.
"I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper," he says *T*-1.
Today, U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected *-1 to rule on Sony's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products, on which deliveries began in July *T*-2.
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order--a decision upheld * on appeal--but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments.
Though *PRO*-1 hoping *PRO*-2 to settle the case, Justin vows *PRO*-1 to fight on, if necessary.
But the battle is more than Justin bargained for *?*.
"I had no idea 0 I was getting in so deep," says *T*-2 Mr. Kaye, who *T*-1 founded Justin in 1982.
Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc., a Taiwan electronics maker, and retired, only *PRO* to find 0 he was bored.
With Justin, he began *-1 selling toys and electronics made * mostly in Hong Kong, *PRO* beginning with Mickey Mouse radios.
The company has grown--to about 40 employees, from four initially, Mr. Kaye says *T*-1.
Justin has been profitable since 1986, adds 0 *T*-2 the official, who *T*-1 shares his office with numerous teddy bears, all samples from his line of plush toys.
Like many others, Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony, in a classic example of market segmentation, changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children *T*-1.
The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models.
(In court papers, Sony says 0 it has spent more than $3 million *U* *PRO*-1 to promote the line, with resulting sales of over a million units.)
Sony found a new market niche, but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower - priced competitor.
His products aren't exact copies of Sony's but strongly resemble them in size, shape and, especially, color.
Sony uses mostly red and blue, with traces of yellow--and so does Justin, on the theory that kids prefer these colors.
("*PRO* To be successful, a product can be any color whatsoever, as long as it is fire - engine red," says *T*-1 Charles E. Baxley, Justin's attorney.)
By last winter, Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York--and Sony noticed.
Indeed, *PRO*-1 concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation--such as *PRO* withholding desirable Sony products--against Justin's customers, Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April.
He himself threatened *PRO*-1 to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department.
But Justin hasn't pursued those charges (which *T*-1 were without merit, according to Mr. Eslinger, the Sony attorney).
Recalls Mr. Baxley: "Our purpose was *PRO* to influence them *PRO*-2 to leave us *PRO*-1 alone.
We never intended *PRO*-1 taking on Sony--we don't have the resources."
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit.
Off and on since then, the companies have skirmished in court.
And Justin, in a news release, says, "*PRO*-1 Once competitive, Sony now resorts to strong - arm tactics in American courtrooms *PRO*-1 to carve out *RNR*-2 and protect *RNR*-2 niche markets."
Sony's lawyer insists that the company's tactics--including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer--are routine in such matters.
He also insists that Sony, no less than others, has a legal right *PRO* to protect its "trade dress," in this case, mostly the colors that it claims 0 *T*-1 make My First Sony products distinctive.
(Justin claims 0 it began *-1 using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children's market.)
Whatever its merits *T*-1, Sony's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin.
It's also costly.
Mr. Kaye says 0 he has paid more than $70,000 *U* in legal fees so far.
Of Sony, Mr. Kaye says: "They know 0 there's no way 0 for them to lose *T*-1.
They just keep *-1 digging me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away *T*-2."
For now, though, he vows *PRO*-1 to hang in.

*PRO* Assuming 0 the stock market doesn't crash again and completely discredit yuppies and trading rooms, American television audiences in a few months may be seeing Britain's concept of both.
"Capital City" is a weekly series that *T*-1 premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer, Thames Television.
The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987.
*PRO* Let's make that 1929, just *PRO* to be sure.
According to the program's publicity prospectus, "Capital City," set at Shane Longman, a fictional mid-sized securities firm with #500 million *U* capital, "follows the fortunes of a close - knit team of young, high - flying dealers, hired * for their particular blend of style, genius and energy.
But with all the money and glamour of high finance come *T*-1 the relentless pressures *PRO* to do well; pressure *PRO* to pull off another million before lunch; pressure *PRO* to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ..."
You needn't be a high - powered securities lawyer *PRO*-1 to realize 0 the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure.
The slickly produced series has been criticized *-1 by London's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail, but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters' professional and private lives.
*PRO*-1 Turned loose in Shane Longman's trading room, the yuppie dealers do little right.
*PRO* Judging by the money lost * and mistakes made * in the early episodes, Shane Longman's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week.
In the opening episode we learn that Michelle, a junior bond trader, has indeed pulled off another million before lunch.
Trouble is, 0 she has lost it just as quickly.
Rather than *PRO*-1 keep the loss *PRO*-2 a secret from the outside world, Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while *PRO* ordering lunch over the phone.
Little chance that Shane Longman is going *-1 to recoup today.
Traders spend the morning *PRO*-1 frantically selling bonds, in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy.
Ah, perfidious Columbia!
The trade figures turn out well, and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price.
So much for *PRO* anticipating the market by a fraction of a second.
And a large slice of the first episode is devoted *-1 to efforts *PRO* to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds (since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays *T*-3?).
Surprisingly, Shane Longman survives the week, only *PRO* to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into *PRO* becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation.
Instead of *PRO* closing ranks *PRO* to protect the firm's reputation, the executive's internal rivals, led * by a loutish American, demand his resignation.
The plot is thwarted *-1 when the firm's major stockholder, kelp farming on the other side of the globe, hurries home *PRO*-2 to support the executive *T*-3.
But the investigation continues.
If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six - figure salaries, you still are left *-1 *PRO*-2 puzzled, because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously.
In fact, few consume much of anything.
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture.
Michelle lives in a hotel room, and although she drives a canary - colored Porsche, she hasn't time 0 *PRO* to clean or repair it *T*-3; the beat - up vehicle can be started *-1 only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock.
And it *EXP*-1 takes Declan, the obligatory ladies' man of the cast, until the third episode *PRO* to get past first base with any of his prey.
Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class - conscious Britain isn't ready *PRO* to come to terms with the wealth created * by the Thatcherian free - enterprise regime.
After all, this isn't old money, but new money, and in many cases, young money.
This attitude is clearly illustrated *-1 in the treatment of Max, the trading room's most flamboyant character.
Yuppily enough, he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church, wears designer clothes and drives an antique car.
But apparently *PRO* to make him palatable, even lovable, to the masses, the script inflates pony - tailed Max into an eccentric genius, master of 11 Chinese dialects.
He takes his wash to the laundromat, where he meets a punky French girl who *T*-1 dupes him into *PRO* providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe *T*-3.
In *PRO* producing and promoting "Capital City," Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day.
The production costs are a not inconsiderable #8 million *U* ($12.4 million *U*), and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of "Dealers," an earlier *PRO* made *-1 - for - TV movie.
Another half million quid went for a volley of full - page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway.
These expenses create a special incentive for "Capital City's" producers to flog it, or a Yank - oriented version of it, in America.
Thames's U.S. marketing agent, Donald Taffner, is preparing *PRO*-1 to do just that.
He is discreetly hopeful, *PRO* citing three U.S. comedy series--"Three's Company," "Too Close for Comfort" and "*PRO* Check It Out"--that *T*-1 had British antecedents.
Perhaps without *PRO*-1 realizing it, Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution: "Capital City" should have been a comedy, a worthy sequel to the screwball British "Carry On" movies of the 1960s.
The seeds already are in the script.
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading - room crew minded a baby, the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm *T*-2.
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known * for light roles.
Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor; William Armstrong, who *T*-1 plays Max, could pass for Hans Conreid, and Douglas Hodge (Declan) for James Farentino; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall, the blank - faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies.
So, OK kids, everybody *?* on stage for "*PRO* Carry On *PRO*-2 Trading": The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly *T*-1 have soared in value because Dai - Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House.
The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa, who *T*-1 slaps a security guard.
He backflips into a desktop computer terminal, which *T*-1 explodes, *PRO*-2 covering Huntz Hall's face with microchips.
And all the while, the bonds are in the baby's diaper.
It should run forever.
Mr. Rustin is senior correspondent in the Journal's London bureau.
Of all the one - time expenses incurred * by a corporation or professional firm, few *T*-1 are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease.
*PRO* To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment, however, the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms.
It must also evaluate the real - estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective.
Specifically, it must understand how real - estate markets overreact to shifts in regional economies *T*-1 and then take advantage of these opportunities.
When a regional economy catches cold *T*-1, the local real - estate market gets pneumonia.
In other words, real - estate market indicators, such as building permits and leasing activity, plummet much further than a local economy in recession.
This was seen *-1 in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York.
But the reverse is also true: When a region's economy rebounds from a slowdown *T*-1, these real - estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy.
Why do local real - estate markets overreact to regional economic cycles *T*-1?
Because real - estate purchases and leases are such major long - term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when *PRO*-2 confident of future economic stability and growth *T*-1.
Metropolitan Detroit was written *-1 off economically during the early 1980s, as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment.
Area employment dropped by 13% from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14%.
However, the real - estate market was hurt *-1 even more.
For example, residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76% from the 1979 peak level.
Once metropolitan Detroit's economy rallied in the mid-1980s, real estate rebounded.
Building permits, for example, soared a staggering 400% between 1982 and the peak year of 1986.
Where, savvy corporations and professional firms are now asking, are *T*-1 today's opportunities?
*PRO* Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver, two of the most depressed, overbuilt and potentially undervalued real - estate markets in the nation.
Of course, some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a counter-cyclical play.
But now appears *-1 to be the time 0 *PRO* to act *T*-2.
Metropolitan Houston's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak.
In the mid-1980s, employment was down as much as 5% from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13%.
The real - estate market suffered even more severe setbacks.
Office construction dropped 97%.
The vacancy rate soared more than 20% in nearly every product category, and more than 30% of office space was vacant.
To some observers, the empty office buildings of Houston's "see - through skyline" were indicative of a very troubled economy.
As usual, the real - estate market had overreacted.
Actually, the region's economy retained a firm foundation.
Metropolitan Houston's population has held *PRO*-1 steady over the past six years.
And personal income, after *PRO* slumping in the mid-1980s, has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms.
Today, metropolitan Houston's real - estate market is poised for a significant turnaround.
More than 42,000 jobs were added *-2 in metro Houston last year, primarily in biotechnology, petrochemical processing, and the computer industry.
This growth puts Houston in the top five metro areas in the nation last year.
And forecasts project a 2.5% to 3% *U* growth rate in jobs over the next few years--nearly twice the national average.
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real - estate market has overreacted to the region's economic trends *T*-1, although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston.
By some measures, metropolitan Denver's economy has actually improved in the past four years.
Its population has continued *-1 to increase since 1983, the peak year of the economic cycle.
Employment is now 4% higher than in 1983.
Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15% between 1983 and 1987 (the most recent year available).
The rates of increase, however, are less than the rapid growth of the boom years, and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy.
In a self - fulfilling prophecy, therefore, the region's real - estate market all but collapsed in recent years.
Housing building permits are down more than 75% from their 1983 peaks.
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver's real - estate market will rebound *T*-1, major public works projects costing several billion dollars *ICH*-2 are under way or planned *-3--such as a new convention center, a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area, and a new regional airport.
When Denver's regional economy begins *-1 to grow faster *T*-2--such a recovery could occur as early as next year--business and consumer confidence will return, and the resulting explosion of real - estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound.
What real - estate strategy should one follow *T*-2 in a metropolitan area whose economic health *T*-1 is not as easy 0 *PRO* to determine *T*-3 as Houston's or Denver's?
Generally, overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak, even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington, New York and Los Angeles.
Vacancy rates in the 15% to 19% *U* range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20% range in a couple of years.
Under these conditions, even a flattening out of economic growth--"*PRO* catching cold"--in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia.
Those looking for real - estate bargains in distressed metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short - term (three - year) lease and wait for the bargains ahead.

American Physicians Service Group Inc. said 0 it purchased about 42% of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $5 million *U* from Texas American Energy Corp.
American Physicians said 0 it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime's five - member board.
American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals.
Prime, based * in Bedminster, N.J., provides management services to cardiac rehabilitation clinics and diagnostic imaging centers.
For the year ended June 30, Prime had a net loss of $3 million *U* on sales of $13.8 million *U*.
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., a unit of Lockheed Corp., said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to join with Aermacchi S.p . A. of Varese, Italy, *PRO* to propose a new generation of jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force.
The Air Force is looking *PRO*-1 to buy 540 new primary jet trainers, with a total value of $1.5 billion *U* to $2 billion *U*, between 1994 and 2004.
The aircraft would replace the T - 37, made * by the Cessna Aircraft Co. unit of General Dynamics Corp., which the Air Force uses *T*-38 *PRO*-1 to train jet pilots.
Lockheed said 0 the U.S. Navy may also buy an additional 340 trainer aircraft 0 *T*-1 to replace its T34C trainers made * by the Beech Aircraft Corp. unit of Raytheon Corp.
Under the agreement with Lockheed, Aermacchi will license Lockheed *PRO*-340 to build the Aermacchi MB - 339 jet tandem - trainer and will supply certain structures.
Lockheed will build additional structures and perform final assembly of the tandem - seat trainer at its Marietta, Ga., plant should the Air Force order the craft.
A Lockheed spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said 0 he wasn't aware of which other companies *T*-1 would be competing for the Air Force contract.
Lomas Financial Corp., Dallas, said 0 it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court *PRO*-1 to allow it to hire Lazard Freres & Co. *PRO*-4 to help it *PRO*-2 sell its leasing unit.
Lomas, assisted * by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, has been trying *PRO*-1 to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months, apparently without success.
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped *PRO*-1 to use proceeds from the sale *PRO*-2 to reduce its debt.
*PRO*-2 Without cash from asset sales and unable *PRO* to reach a new bank - credit agreement, Lomas defaulted on $145 million *U* in notes that *T*-1 became due Sept. 1.
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 *PRO* to give it additional time 0 *PRO* to work on a plan *PRO* to restructure its $1.45 billion *U* in senior debt *T*-1.
Lomas said 0 Merrill Lynch, which *T*-1 owns bonds and equity in Lomas, couldn't continue as Lomas's investment banker because it is also a creditor.
It said 0 it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard's offices in Europe and Japan, where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company *T*-1.
The inflation - adjusted growth rate for France's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised *-1 upward to 0.8% from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7%, the National Statistics Institute said 0 *T*-2.
The state agency said 0 the latest revision left the growth rate for the first - quarter compared with the previous three months *PRO*-1 unchanged at 1.3%.
If the economy continues *-1 to expand by 0.8% a quarter for the rest of the year, it would leave GDP growth for all of 1989 at 3%, the institute said 0 *T*-2.
That would be down from the 3.8% rise posted * in 1988.
Giant Group Ltd. said 0 it terminated negotiations for the purchase of Aspen Airways, a Denver - based regional carrier that *T*-1 operates the United Express connector service under contract to UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
Giant, a Beverly Hills, Calif., collection of companies that *T*-3 is controlled *-1 by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, didn't give a reason for *PRO* halting its plan *PRO* to acquire the airline, and Aspen officials couldn't be reached *-2 for comment.
Giant agreed last month *PRO*-1 to purchase the carrier.
Giant hasn't ever disclosed the proposed price, although Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va. - based aircraft consulting concern, has valued Aspen's fleet at about $46 million *U*.
The airline would have become the latest in a peculiar blend of Giant companies, which *T*-1 are involved in *PRO* making cement, recycling newsprint and operating fast - food restaurants.
Apple Computer Inc. said 0 it will offer cash rebates on several of its machines from Oct. 14 to Dec. 31., as part of a holiday - season sales promotion.
Apple will offer a $150 *U* rebate on its Apple IIGS with any Apple Monitor and disk drive; $200 *U* on the basic Macintosh Plus central processing unit; $250 *U* on the Macintosh SE central processing unit; $250 *U* on the Macintosh SE / 30 cpu, and $300 *U* on a Macintosh IIcx with any Apple video card and Apple monitor.
The rebates, as a percentage of the retail cost of the cpu of each system, amount to 6% to 13% *U*.
The company is also offering a free trial of its computers to consumers who *T*-1 qualify for its credit cards or leases.
Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said 0 a temporary cessation of operations at its Sunshine Bridge uranium - recovery facility in Donaldsonville, La., will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners Limited Partnership unit.
The company didn't elaborate.
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary mothballing of the plant, but that the plant can be reactivated *-1 quickly when the market improves *T*-2.
More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced *-1 at the facility during the past seven years.
A second uranium - recovery plant at Uncle Sam, La., that *T*-1 produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually, will continue *-2 to operate.
Freeport - McMoRan said 0 the shutdown won't affect sales volumes under long - term sales contracts of its Freeport Uranium Recovery Co. unit, but will reduce the amount of product sold * on the spot market.
Freeport - McMoRan Resource Partners, as owner of the uranium - recovery technology, receives royalty payments.
Kysor Industrial Corp. said 0 it expects its third - quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents *U* a share, compared with 61 cents a share a year ago.
Analysts had been projecting that the company's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents *U* a share.
The year - earlier third - quarter earnings amounted to $4.1 million *U*.
The company said 0 a drop in activity in the powerboat industry reduced sales volume at its two marine - related operations.
Also, the company said 0 its commercial products operation failed *-1 to meet forecasts.
Kysor, a maker of heavy - duty truck and commercial refrigeration equipment, said 0 it expects its fourth - quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels, which *T*-1 are between 30 cents and 50 cents *U* a share.
Government officials here and in other countries laid plans *ICH*-1 through the weekend *PRO* to head off a Monday market meltdown--but went out of their way *PRO*-2 to keep their moves *PRO*-3 quiet.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones, *PRO*-2 making it *EXP*-1 clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared *PRO* to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system, as it did in October 1987, if the action were needed *PRO* to prevent a financial crisis.
And at the Treasury, Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge.
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters.
In addition, officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that *PRO* avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday's market drop turn into this morning's rout.
"The disadvantage at this point is that anything 0 you do *T*-2 that *T*-1 looks like you are doing too much tends *-4 to reinforce a sense of crisis," said *T*-3 one government official, insisting on anonymity.
The Fed's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled *-1 Sunday morning, when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official *PRO*-3 saying 0 the central bank was prepared *PRO* to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning *T*-2.
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised *-1 by both stories, according to knowledgeable sources, and insisted 0 he hadn't authorized any public comment.
Nevertheless, Fed officials acknowledged 0 the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank's game plan.
It is prepared *PRO* to assume the same role 0 it played *T*-2 in October 1987, *PRO* providing money to the markets if *PRO* necessary *PRO* to keep the financial system *PRO*-3 afloat.
The Fed provides money to the banking system by *PRO*-1 buying government securities from financial institutions.
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC's "This Week."
"Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact.
I'm sure 0 they'll do what *T*-1's right, what *T*-2's prudent, what *T*-3's sensible," he said *T*-4.
When it was suggested *-1 0 his comment was a "non-answer *T*-2," Mr. Darman replied: "It is a non-answer.
But, in this context, that's the smart thing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1."
At the Treasury, Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market's drop.
"Today's stock market decline doesn't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy," he said *T*-1.
"The economy remains well - balanced, and the outlook is for continued moderate growth."
But administration officials conceded that Friday's drop carried the chance of further declines this week.
"One possibility is that this is a surgical setback, reasonably limited in its breadth, and not a major problem," said *T*-2 one senior administration official, who also *T*-3 asked that he not be named *-1.
"The other is that we see another major disaster, like two years ago.
I think 0 that's less likely."
Nevertheless, Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening, *PRO*-1 monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world.
The action was expected *-1 to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST--when stocks there plunged *T*-2--and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe.
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned *PRO*-1 to keep market rooms *PRO*-2 operating throughout the night *PRO* to monitor the developments.
In Tokyo, share prices dropped sharply by 1.7% in early Monday morning trading.
After the initial slide, the market appeared *-1 to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower.
In the Bush administration, the lead is being taken *-1 by Treasury Secretary Brady, Undersecretary Robert Glauber and Assistant Secretary Mullins.
The three men worked together on the so - called Brady Commission, headed * by Mr. Brady, which *T*-2 was established *-1 after the 1987 crash *PRO*-1 to examine the market's collapse.
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets, and financial market crises.
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market's decline began *T*-1.
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. Mullins, who in turn *T*-3 was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges.
Later, Mr. Brady phoned Mr. Greenspan, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas.
Aides say 0 he continued *-4 to work the phones through the weekend.
Administration officials say 0 President Bush was briefed *-1 throughout Friday afternoon and evening, even after *PRO* leaving for Camp David.
He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin, chairman of the counsel of economic advisers.
Government officials tried throughout the weekend *PRO*-5 to render a business - as - usual appearance in order *PRO*-5 to avoid any sense of panic.
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford, for instance, was at a meeting of the Business Council in Hot Springs, Va., when the stock market fell *T*-6, and remained there through the following day.
And as of last night, Fed Chairman Greenspan hadn't canceled his plans *PRO* to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning.
Ironically, Mr. Greenspan was scheduled *-7 *PRO*-8 to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20, 1987.
He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19, when the market plummeted 508 points *T*-8, but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without *PRO*-9 delivering his speech.
Drug Emporium Inc. said 0 Gary Wilber, 39 years old, who *T*-2 had been president and chief operating officer for the past year, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 chief executive officer of this drugstore chain.
He succeeds his father, Philip T. Wilber, who *T*-1 founded the company and remains chairman.
Robert E. Lyons III, 39, who *T*-2 headed the company's Philadelphia region, was appointed *-1 *PRO*-3 president and chief operating officer, *PRO*-1 succeeding Gary Wilber.
U.S. OFFICIALS MOVED *PRO*-1 to head off any repeat of Black Monday today following Friday's plunge in stock prices.
Fed Chairman Greenspan signaled that the central bank was prepared *PRO* to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system *PRO* to prevent a financial crisis.
Other U.S. and foreign officials also mapped out plans, though they kept their moves *PRO*-3 quiet *PRO*-2 to avoid *PRO*-1 making the financial markets more jittery.
Friday's sell - off was triggered *-1 by the collapse of UAL's buy - out plan and a big rise in producer prices.
The Dow Jones industrials skidded 190.58, to 2569.26.
The junk bond market came to a standstill, while Treasury bonds soared and the dollar fell.
Japanese stocks dropped early Monday, but by late morning were turning around.
The dollar was trading sharply lower in Tokyo.
Prospects for a new UAL buy - out proposal appear *-1 bleak.
Many banks refused *PRO*-1 to back the $6.79 billion *U* transaction, but bankers said 0 it was not from any unwillingness *PRO* to finance takeovers.
The decision was based *-1 solely on problems with the UAL management - pilot plan, they said 0 *T*-2.
The surge in producer prices in September followed three months of declines, but analysts were divided on whether the 0.9% jump signaled a severe worsening of inflation.
Also, retail sales grew 0.5% last month.
A capital - gains tax cut was removed *-1 from the Senate's deficit reduction bill, but proponents still hope *PRO*-2 to enact the cut this year.
Bush won't press for a capital - gains provision in the final deficit bill when House - Senate conferees meet later this week *T*-1.
General Motors signaled that up to five North American assembly plants may close by the mid-1990s as it tries *PRO*-1 to cut excess capacity.
U.S. car and truck sales fell 12.6% in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 - model year, *PRO*-1 dragged down by a sharp decline in GM sales.
Warner and Sony are entangled in a legal battle over movie producers Peter Gruber and Jon Peters.
The fight could set back Sony's plans *PRO* to enter the U.S. movie business.

When China opened its doors to foreign investors in 1979 *T*-1, toy makers from Hong Kong were among the first 0 *T*-2 to march in.
Today, with about 75% of the companies' products being made *-1 in China, the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council, Dennis Ting, has suggested a new sourcing label: "Made * in China by Hong Kong Companies."
The toy makers were pushed *-1 across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony.
But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4, the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China.
Although the manufacturers stress that production hasn't been affected *-1 by China's political turmoil, they are looking for additional sites.
The toy makers, and their foreign buyers, cite uncertainty about China's economic and political policies.
"Nobody wants *PRO*-2 to have all his eggs in one basket," says *T*-1 David Yeh, chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd.
Indeed, Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, long before the massacre.
Their steps were partly prompted *-1 by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China.
By *PRO* diversifying supply sources, the toy makers don't intend *PRO*-1 to withdraw from China, manufacturers and foreign buyers say 0 *T*-2.
It *EXP*-1 wouldn't be easy *PRO* to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade.
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong's port, airport, banks and support industries, such as printing companies, have made China's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site.
"South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world," says *T*-1 Henry Hu, executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd.
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers' reliance on factories across the border.
In 1988, exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19% from 1987, to HK$10.05 billion *U* (US$1.29 billion *U*).
But re-exports, mainly from China, jumped 75%, to HK$15.92 billion *U*.
In 1989's first seven months, domestic exports fell 29%, to HK$3.87 billion *U*, while re-exports rose 56%, to HK$11.28 billion *U*.
Manufacturers say 0 there is no immediate substitute for southern China, where an estimated 120,000 people are employed *-1 by the toy industry *T*-2.
"For the next few years, *PRO* like it or not, China is going *-1 to be the main supplier," says *T*-2 Edmund Young, vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd., one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers 0 *T*-3 to move across the border.
In the meantime, as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites, they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia.
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand, including Matchbox, Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co., the toy manufacturer headed * by Mr. Ting.
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied *-1.
With the European Community set *-1 to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992, several Hong Kong companies are beginning *-2 to consider Spain, Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites.
Worries about China came just as Hong Kong's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies, Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc.
Hong Kong manufacturers say 0 large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, *PRO* causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management.
The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that *T*-1 will lead to improved results.
Still, they long for a "mega-hit" toy to excite retail sales in the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest market for toys and games.
The closest thing 0 the colony's companies have *T*-1 to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured * by Playmates Holdings Ltd.
*PRO*-1989 Introduced in mid-1988, the 15 - centimeter - tall plastic turtles are based *-1989 on an American comic book and television series.
Paul Kwan, managing director of Playmates, says 0 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold *-1, *PRO* placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest - selling toys in the U.S. .
Should sales continue *-2 to be strong through the Christmas season, which *T*-1 accounts for about 60% of U.S. retail toy sales, Mr. Kwan said 0 the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates.
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988.
Besides the lack of a fast - selling product, they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System, an expensive video game made * by Nintendo Co. of Japan.
Nintendo buyers have little money left *PRO* to spend on other products.
Many of the toy makers' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing's austerity programs launched * late last year.
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided *-1 only three days a week in recent months, down from five days a week, as the province's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity.
Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants.
Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4.
Also, concern exists that the harder - line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong, which *T*-1 has been the main laboratory for the open - door policy and economic reforms.
But, toy manufacturers and other industrialists say 0 Beijing will be restrained *-1 from *PRO* tightening controls on export - oriented southern China.
They say 0 China's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short *ICH*-1 of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong.
"The Chinese leaders have *-1 to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports," says *T*-2 Mr. Kwan of Playmates.
The Canadian government announced a new, 12 - year Canada Savings Bond issue that *T*-1 will yield investors 10.5% in the first year.
The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set *-1 each fall, when details of a new series are released *-2 *T*-3.
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for *PRO* meeting its financial requirements.
The government has about 41.4 billion Canadian dollars (US$35.2 billion *U*) of such bonds currently outstanding.
Only Canadian residents are permitted *-3 *PRO*-4 to buy Canada Savings Bonds, which *T*-2 may be redeemed *-1 any time at face value.
The bonds go on sale Oct. 19.
The state - controlled insurer Assurances Generales de France said 0 it has obtained regulatory approval *PRO* to increase its stake in the financial holding company Cie. de Navigation Mixte above 10% from the current level of about 8%.
Friday's approval was needed *-1 *PRO* to conform with Bourse rules regarding companies with bank interests and follows a similar approval given * Wednesday to Cie . Financiere de Paribas.
Both Paribas and AGF have been increasing their stakes in Navigation Mixte recently for what they have termed *T*-2 *PRO*-3 "investment purposes," although the issue has been surrounded *-1 by takeover speculation in recent weeks.
AGF didn't comment officially on its reasons for *PRO* seeking the approval, but people close to the group said 0 it was done *-1 *PRO* to make sure 0 the group would have the flexibility 0 *PRO* to increase its stake in the future *T*-2, should interesting price opportunities arise.
An AGF official did specify, however, that there was no foundation to recent rumors 0 the group might be acting in concert with Paribas.
Proposals for government - operated "national service," like influenza, flare up from time to time, depress the resistance of the body politic, run their course, and seem *-1 to disappear, only *PRO* to mutate and afflict public life anew.
The disease metaphor comes to mind, of course, not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service.
Rather, it is born *-1 of frustration with *PRO* having *-3 to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought 0 *T*-4 had been eliminated *-2 in the early 1970s, along with smallpox.
It is back with us again, in the form of legislation *PRO* to pay volunteers under a "National and Community Service Act," a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall.
Why does the national - service virus keep coming back *T*-1?
Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel.
If only we could get America's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able *PRO* to teach self - discipline again and revive the spirit of giving.
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted *-1 as a way of *PRO* curing the manifest inequities of the draft--by, of all things, *PRO* expanding the draft *ICH*-2.
Those of us who *T*-1 resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long - term aim of many national - service backers, despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion.
Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed *-1 to doom national service as much as the draft.
But the virus was kept *-1 *PRO*-4 alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago, when it again was let *-2 loose *T*-3.
This time it attempted *PRO*-1 to invade two connected problems, the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans.
Why *PRO* not keep *RNR*-1 and even expand *RNR*-1 the loans and grants, the advocates reasoned *?*, but *PRO* require some form of service from each recipient *T*-3?
Military service, moreover, could be a national - service option.
Thus, undoubtedly it *EXP*-2 was hoped *-1 that the new strain of national service would prove *-3 contagious, *PRO* infecting patriotic conservatives, *PRO* pay - as - you - go moderates, and idealistic liberals.
The Democratic Leadership Council, a centrist group sponsoring the plan, surely thought 0 it might help the party *PRO*-1 to attract support, especially among college students and their parents.
A provision allowing grants to be applied *-2 to first - home purchases was added *-1 *PRO* to appeal to those who *T*-3 had had enough of schooling.
The DLC plan envisaged "volunteers" planting trees *RNR*-1, emptying bedpans *RNR*-1, tutoring children *RNR*-1, and assisting librarians *RNR*-1 for $100 *U* a week, tax free, plus medical care.
With a tax - free $10,000 *U* voucher payment at the end of each year, the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $17,500 *U* a year.
Mind you, most of "the volunteers" would be unskilled 17 - to 18 - year - olds, some not even high school graduates, and many saving money by *PRO*-1 living at home.
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families.
As it happened, political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that *T*-1 count on the present education grant system, so the national - service devotees decided *PRO*-2 to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of "*PRO* give in order *PRO* to get."
Opposition to national service from the Pentagon, which *T*-2 wants *PRO*-3 to protect its own recruitment process, also led to the military - service option being dropped *-1.
Clearly, a new rationale for national service had *-1 to be cooked up.
What better place 0 *PRO* to turn *T*-3 than Sen. Edward Kennedy's Labor Committee, that great stove of government expansionism, where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept *-1 on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine *T*-2?
In this case, the new recipe for national service called for *PRO* throwing many assorted legislative leftovers *ICH*-2 into one kettle: a demonstration project for educational aid (particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn), a similar demonstration program for youth conservation (a la Sen. Chris Dodd), a competitive grants program to states 0 *T*-1 to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects (a Kennedy specialty), a community service work - study program for students (pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers, among others), plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer, Foster Grandparent, and Senior Companion programs.
Before the menu is printed *-1, the House may add more ingredients, also *PRO* changing the initial price, now posted at some $330 million *U*.
It is widely known *-1 that "too many cooks spoil the broth," but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks, especially if they are senators.
The "omnibus" bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop, but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard.
The aroma of patronage is in the air.
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance?
On the contrary, it is as robust as ever.
According to the Gallup Poll, American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service, while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30% (adjusted * for inflation).
Even if government does see various "unmet needs," national service is not the way 0 *PRO* to meet them *T*-1.
If we want *PRO*-1 to support students, we might adopt the idea used * in other countries of *PRO* offering more scholarships based * on something called * *PRO*-2 "scholarship," rather than on the government's idea of "service."
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students.
What we do not need *-4 to do *T*-1 is *PRO* start a war, and then try *PRO*-2 to justify it by *PRO*-3 creating a GI Bill.
To the extent 0 we lack manpower 0 *T*-3 to staff menial jobs in hospitals *T*-2, for example, we should raise pay, pursue labor - saving technology, or allow more legal immigration, rather than overpay high school graduates as short - term workers and cause resentment among permanent workers paid * lesser amounts *PRO*-1 to do the same jobs.
Will national service, in the current highly politicized and opportunistic form exert enough appeal *PRO* to get adopted *-1?
Not necessarily.
Polls show wide, generalized support for some vague concept of service, but the bill now under discussion lacks any passionate public backing.
Nonetheless, Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting "associations," "societies" and "councils," some of which *T*-1 may hope *PRO*-2 to receive the paid "volunteers."
So far, the president seems *-1 ill - disposed *PRO* to substitute any of the omnibus for his own free - standing proposal *PRO* to endow a "Points of Light" foundation with $25 million *U* *PRO* to inform citizens of all ages and exhort them to genuine volunteerism.
However, even this admirable plan could become objectionable if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure *PRO* to add to the scope of the president's initiative or *PRO* to involve the independent foundation in *PRO* "brokering" federal funds for volunteer projects.
There's no need for such concessions.
The omnibus can be defeated *-1, the virus controlled *-3, and real service protected *-4.
National service, the utopian idea, still won't go away then, of course, but the millions of knee - socked youth performing works of "civic content" will be mobilized *-1 only in the imagination of their progenitors.

Recognition Equipment Inc. said 0 it settled a civil action filed * against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service.
The government sued the company in April, *PRO*-1 seeking $23,000 *U* and other unspecified damages related * to an alleged contract - steering scheme.
The suit named the company, former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr., former vice president Robert W. Reedy and five defendants who *T*-1 weren't part of the company.
The suit charged the defendants with *PRO* causing Peter E. Voss, an ex-member of the Postal Service board of governors, to accept $23,000 *U* in bribes, kickbacks and gratuities.
Mr. Voss was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $11,000 *U* for his role in the scheme.
In the agreement, Recognition agreed *PRO*-1 to pay the government $20,000 *U* in return for the release of all claims against the company, Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy.
The five additional defendants weren't parties to the settlement.
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia.
They were indicted *-1 last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related * to an effort *PRO* to win $400 million *U* in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment.
The company and its executives deny the charges.
In a related development, Recognition Equipment said 0 the Postal Service has barred the company from *PRO* bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days.
The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7, 1988, and has been renewing the ban ever since.
The company said 0 it will continue *-1 to pursue a lifting of the suspension.
Common Cause asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department *PRO*-2 to investigate $1 million *U* in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles Keating to five U.S. senators who *T*-1 interceded with thrift - industry regulators for him.
Mr. Keating is currently the subject of a $1.1 billion *U* federal anti-racketeering lawsuit accusing him of *PRO* bleeding off assets of a California thrift 0 he controlled *T*-1, Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and driving it into insolvency.
Fred Wertheimer--president of Common Cause, the self - styled citizens lobby--said 0 Mr. Keating already has conceded *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO*-2 to buy influence with the lawmakers--Democratic Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan; and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
Mr. Wertheimer based this on a statement by Mr. Keating that *T*-2 was quoted *-1 in a Wall Street Journal story in April: "One question...had *-3 to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures *PRO*-4 to take up my cause.
I want *PRO*-1 to say in the most forceful way 0 I can *?* *T*-2: 0 I certainly hope so."
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. DeConcini's office in April 1987, the five senators asked federal regulators *PRO*-1 to ease up on Lincoln.
According to notes taken * by one of the participants at the meeting, the regulators said 0 Lincoln was gambling dangerously with depositors' federally insured money and was "a ticking time bomb."
Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were being too zealous.
The notes show that Sen. DeConcini called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's regulations *PRO*-1 "grossly unfair," and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. Keating's thrift was "viable and profitable."
For the next two years, the Bank Board, which at the time *T*-1 was the agency responsible for *PRO* regulating thrifts, failed *-2 to act--even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent.
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., entered bankruptcy - law proceedings this April 13, and regulators seized the thrift the next day.
The newly formed Resolution Trust Corp., successor to the Bank Board, filed suit against Mr. Keating and several others on Sept. 15.
Mr. Keating has filed his own suit, *PRO*-2 alleging that his property was taken *-1 illegally.
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln's collapse has been estimated *-1 at as much as $2.5 billion *U*.
Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years, mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers.
In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign, Sen. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned $76,000 *U* in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators.
Sen. DeConcini, after months of *PRO* fending off intense press criticism, returned $48,000 *U* only last month, shortly after the government formally accused Mr. Keating of *PRO* defrauding Lincoln.
In addition, Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid $13,433 *U* to American Continental as reimbursement for trips 0 he and his family took *T*-1 aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating's vacation home at Cat Cay, the Bahamas, from 1984 through 1986.
Sen. McCain said 0 he had meant *PRO*-1 to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter "fell between the cracks."
Mr. Keating, his family members and associates also donated $112,000 *U* to Sen. McCain's congressional campaigns over the years, according to press accounts.
But Sen. McCain says 0 Mr. Keating broke off their friendship abruptly in 1987, because the senator refused *PRO*-1 to press the thrift executive's case as vigorously as Mr. Keating wanted *?*.
"He became very angry at that, left my office and told a number of people that I was a wimp," Sen. McCain recalls *T*-1.
In July, California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave $850,000 *U* in corporate funds to three tax - exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston, who *T*-1 conceded that *PRO* soliciting the money was "a pretty stupid thing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 politically."
In addition, Sen. Cranston received $47,000 *U* in campaign donations through Mr. Keating, and the California Democratic party received $85,000 *U* in corporate donations for a 1986 *PRO* get - out - the - vote drive that *T*-1 benefited the senator's re-election campaign that year.
Also in July, Ohio newspapers disclosed $200,000 *U* in corporate donations by Mr. Keating to the National Council on Public Policy, a political committee controlled * by Sen. Glenn.
That was in addition to $34,000 *U* in direct campaign donations arranged * by Mr. Keating to the Ohio senator.
Mr. Wertheimer said 0 the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel *PRO*-2 to conduct an investigation, as *PRO* was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright.
Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics panel, wouldn't comment.
Sen. Riegle said 0 he would cooperate with any inquiry, but that his conduct had been "entirely proper."
Sen. McCain said 0 he had been "deeply concerned *ICH*-2" at the time of the meeting that it might seem *-1 to be improper, but decided 0 it was "entirely appropriate" for him to seek fair treatment for a constituent.
Sen. Glenn said 0 he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and "I am completely satisfied *PRO* to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee."
Sen. DeConcini said, "When all is said and done *T*-2, I expect *PRO*-3 to be fully exonerated *-1."
Sen. Cranston, who *T*-1 had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating, portrayed his role in 1987 as *PRO* prodding regulators *PRO*-2 to act.
"Why didn't the Bank Board act sooner *T*-2?" he said *T*-1.
"That is what Common Cause should ask 0 *T*-2 be investigated *-1.
The Bush administration, *PRO*-1 urging the Supreme Court *PRO*-2 to give states more leeway *PRO* to restrict abortions, said 0 minors haven't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents.
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, recognizing a constitutional right to abortion, was incorrect.
He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 *PRO* to rule that minors have a right to abortion that *T*-2 can't be absolutely vetoed *-1 by their parents.
The administration's position was outlined *-1 in a friend - of - the - court brief filed * in one of three abortion cases 0 the Supreme Court will hear *T*-2 argued *-3 and will decide *T*-2 this term.
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that *T*-2 requires that both parents of a minor be notified *-1 before she may have an abortion.
The administration urged the justices *PRO*-1 to adopt a legal standard suggested * by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions *T*-2.
Under that standard, which *T*-1 garnered the votes of only three of the nine justices, a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a "reasonable" justification for *PRO* adopting it.
That is a much easier standard 0 for a state to satisfy *T*-2 than the Supreme Court's test since 1973, which *T*-1 requires a state *PRO*-3 to have a "compelling" reason for *PRO* restricting abortion.
On the provisions of the Minnesota law, the Bush administration said that *PRO* requiring that both parents be notified *-1 is a reasonable regulation, and that there is no need *PRO* to have an alternative that *T*-2 allows minors to go to court for a judge's permission instead.
The case, Hodgson vs. Minnesota, will be argued *-1 Nov. 29.
Investcorp, New York, said 0 it and the management of Sports & Recreation Inc. bought the operator of the 10 - store Sports Unlimited chain for some $40 million *U*.
The investment bank becomes majority shareholder in Sports & Recreation, a 10 - year - old sporting goods retailer, said *T*-1 Oliver E. Richardson, a member of Investcorp's management committee and a director of the chain.
Sports Unlimited, Tampa, Fla., posted revenue of $59 million *U* for the year ended July 31.
The company is "very profitable" on an operating basis, Mr. Richardson said 0 *?*, but he declined *PRO*-2 to specify numbers.
In 1982, Sports & Recreation's managers and certain passive investors purchased the company from Brunswick Corp. of Skokie, Ill.
In the latest transaction, management bought out the passive investors' holding, Mr. Richardson said 0 *T*-1.
Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation S.A. said 0 group profit before taxes and contributions to employee profit - sharing soared 97% to 839 million francs ($129.6 million *U*) in the first half of 1989 from 425 million francs a year earlier.
The French aircraft group pointed out, however, that financial results from its sector of industry are frequently erratic because of irregular cash flow from large contracts.
It noted, for example, that group revenue for the first half was 8.734 billion francs, down about 12% from 9.934 billion francs a year earlier.
Still, it said 0 it expects sales for all of 1989 to be on the order of 20 billion francs, *PRO* reflecting anticipated billings for two large contracts in the second half of the year.
For all of 1988, Dassault had group profit of 428 million francs on revenue of 18.819 billion francs.
The group hasn't yet released earnings figures for the first half of 1989, nor has it made a detailed forecast of its full - year earnings.
Greece's second bout of general elections this year is slated *-1 for Nov. 5.
For those hoping *PRO* to see a modicum of political normalcy restored *-1--in view of Greece's eight - year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three - month hitch with a conservative - communist coalition government--there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass.
In the mid-June round of voting, Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party.
The ad interim coalition government that *T*-1 emerged from post-electoral hagglings was, in essence, little more than the ill - conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation: On one side, the center - right New Democracy Party, headed * by Constantine Mitsotakis.
On the other, the so - called Coalition of the Left and Progress--a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro - Communist cousin, the Hellenic Left.
The unifying bond *ICH*-1 for this left - right mismatch was plain: PASOK (Mr. Papandreou's party) as common political enemy.
The ostensible goal was a mop - up of government corruption, purportedly at all levels, but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates.
In point of fact, this catharsis was overdue by decades.
When *PRO* reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges *T*-1, however, the notion transmogrified into a promised assault, with targets primarily for political gains, not justice.
With regard to Greece's long - bubbling bank - looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self - confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that *T*-1 would return him to Greece *T*-2.
Mr. Koskotas's credibility is, at best, problematic.
He has ample motive *PRO* to shift the blame, and his testimony has also been found *-1 less than forthright on numerous points.
Nevertheless, the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity.
Among unanswered questions are *T*-3 whether Mr. Papandreou received $23 million *U* of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $734,000 *U* in bribes, as *PRO* contended *-4; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies *PRO*-5 to deposit some $57 million *U* in Mr. Koskotas's bank and then skim off the interest; and, what PASOK's cut was *T*-1 from the $210 million *U* 0 Mr. Koskotas pinched *T*-2.
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted *PRO*-1 to refer them to the special court.
But eluding parliamentary probe was *T*-2 the case of millions of drachmas 0 Mr. Koskotas funneled *T*-1 into New Democracy coffers.
In the end, the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and "indications" that *T*-1 point to PASOK, not clinching proof.
On another issue, Greeks were told *-1 how their national intelligence agency, the EYP, regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures, including key opposition politicians, journalists and PASOK cabinet members *T*-2.
Despite convincing arguments, it was never established *-1 that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps.
The central weakness of the "scandals" debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks *T*-1.
The coalition government tried *PRO*-1 to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for *PRO* OKing the purchase of F - 16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft, produced * by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France's Avions Marcel Dassault, respectively.
Naturally, neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected *-1 to hamper its prospective future dealings by *PRO*-2 making disclosures of sums paid * (or not) to various Greek officials for services rendered *.
So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter: PASOK, whether guilty or not, can now traipse the countryside *PRO*-1 condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou's expense.
But while verbal high jinks alone won't help PASOK *PRO*-2 regain power, Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated *-1.
First came *T*-1 his predictable fusillade: He charged 0 the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by *PRO* collaborating in a right - wing plot aimed * at *PRO* ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece.
Then, *PRO*-1 to buttress his credibility with the left, he enticed some smaller leftist parties *PRO*-2 to stand for election under the PASOK banner.
Next, he continued *-2 to court the communists--many of whom *T*-1 feel betrayed by the left - right coalition's birth--by *PRO* bringing into PASOK a well - respected Communist Party candidate.
For balance, and in hopes of *PRO*-1 gaining some disaffected centrist votes, he managed *PRO*-1 to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis.
Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal - stench, but also with "seals of approval" from representatives of its harshest accusers.
Crucial as these elections are for Greece, pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle.
The country's future NATO participation remains unsure, for instance.
Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation.
Greece's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well.
For one, the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990.
Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen *-1 before the June elections, but the clock is running.
Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian terrorist who *T*-2 is wanted *-1 in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight.
The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case, but the matter awaits final approval from Greece's next justice minister.
The Greeks seem *-2 barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted *-1 in or out for international efforts *PRO* to combat terrorism.
That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable; the Greek press, previously eager *PRO* to palm off PASOK's line, has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild - eyed vengeance.
Yet the possibility of another lash - up government is all too real.
If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader, he could hamstring a conservative - led coalition.
Also, he could force new elections early next year by *PRO* frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March.
New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK, *PRO*-2 forgetting *PRO*-1 to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles.
As for Mr. Papandreou?
He's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage.
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who *T*-1 ever raked muck, it *EXP*-2 seems *-3 far wiser *PRO* to view him as sidelined, but certainly not yet eliminated.
Mr. Carpenter, a regional correspondent for National Review, has lived in Athens since 1981.
Roger Rosenblatt, editor of U.S. News & World Report, resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine.
Mr. Rosenblatt said 0 he resigned because of difficulties with *PRO* commuting between his home in New York and the magazine's editorial offices in Washington.
"Frankly, I missed my family," said *T*-1 Mr. Rosenblatt.
In Mr. Rosenblatt's tenure, the magazine's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly.
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation, U.S. News still ranks third *T*-1 behind Time Warner Inc.'s Time magazine, with 4.4 million circulation, and Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek, with 3.3 million circulation.
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor in chief, said 0 Mr. Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby, the magazine's executive editor, and Merrill McLoughlin, a senior writer.
Mr. Ruby and Ms. McLoughlin are married *-1 to each other.
Mr. Zuckerman said 0 his magazine would maintain its editorial format, which *T*-1 is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service - oriented, how - to articles.
Mr. Rosenblatt, a senior writer at Time magazine before *PRO* joining U.S. News & World Report, said 0 he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor.
The offers were *-1 to work as a writer, not an editor.
He said 0 he will now consider those offers.
Antonio L. Savoca, 66 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive officer of the Atlantic Research Corp. subsidiary.

First Chicago Corp. posted a third - quarter loss of $23.3 million *U* after *PRO*-1 joining other big banks in *PRO*-2 further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans.
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago, with $48 billion *U* in assets, said 0 it set aside $200 million *U* *PRO* to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries.
The addition, on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign - loan reserves, brings the reserve to a level equaling 79% of medium - term and long - term loans outstanding to troubled nations.
First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $1.7 billion *U* from $3 billion *U*.
Despite this loss, First Chicago said 0 it doesn't need *-1 to sell stock *PRO*-1 to raise capital.
During the quarter, the company realized a pretax gain of $60.4 million *U* from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit.
Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24% against last year's third quarter, to $38.2 million *U* from $50.5 million *U*.
Gains from First Chicago's venture capital unit, a big leveraged buy - out investor, rose 32% to $34 million *U* from $25.7 million *U* a year ago.

The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a pause at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash, trading in the Merc's stock - index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday's close, a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The aim of the interruption would be *PRO* to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, which *T*-2 would be hammered *-1 by such a volatile move on the Merc.
That early - morning breather is just one of a number of safeguards adopted * after the 1987 crash.
The Big Board also added computer capacity *PRO* to handle huge surges in trading volume.
Several of those post-crash changes kicked in during Friday's one - hour collapse and worked as *PRO* expected, even though they didn't prevent a stunning plunge.
But the major "circuit breakers" have yet *-2 to be evaluated *-1.
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test.
A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other, more sweeping changes proposed--but not implemented--after the last crash.
Most notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended * by the Brady Task Force, which *T*-2 analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived *-1--especially because that group's chairman is now the Treasury secretary.
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved *PRO* establishing a single overarching regulator 0 *T*-1 to handle crucial cross-market questions, such as *PRO* setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets.
But for the moment, attention focuses on the reforms that *T*-2 were put *-1 into place, and market regulators and participants said 0 the circuit breakers worked as *PRO* intended.
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed * on of the Merc's Standard & Poor's 500 contract, as well as "hot - line" communications among exchanges.
Those pauses--from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half - hour later--forced traders *PRO*-2 to buy and sell contracts at prices at *RNR*-1 or higher than *RNR*-1 their frozen levels.
During the first halt, after the S&P index had fallen 12 points, the Big Board's "Sidecar" computer program automatically was triggered *-1.
That system is designed *-1 *PRO* to separate computer - generated program trades from all other trades *PRO* to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks.
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well - drilled school.
"You don't want the fire but you know what *PRO* to do *T*-1," said *T*-2 Howard Dubnow, an independent floor broker and a Merc governor.
"There was no panic.
The system worked the way 0 we devised it *PRO*-2 to work *T*-1."
After *PRO* reopening for about 15 minutes, the S&P index tumbled to its 30 - point limit and the second freeze went into effect.
Traders then spent the last half - hour *PRO*-3 "watching *PRO*-4 to see if the Dow would drop 250 points," Mr. Dubnow added 0 *T*-2, *PRO* referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour *T*-1.
One observer estimated that 80% to 90% *U* of the S&P traders "were just standing around *PRO*-1 watching."
But the 250 - point circuit breaker never had *-2 to kick in, and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade's Major Market Index also weren't triggered *-1.
The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used * by program traders *PRO* to run their computerized trading strategies.
The programs are considered by many *-1 to be a major cause of the 1987 crash.
The process of post-crash reforms began with calls 0 *T*-1 to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments.
In October 1987, just after the market drop, Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way 0 the financial markets are structured and regulated *T*-1.
Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled *-1 down to a series of steps 0 *PRO* to soften big stock drops by *PRO* interrupting trading *PRO* to give market players time 0 *PRO* to pause and reconsider positions *T*-3 *T*-2.
In addition, limits were placed *-1 on computer - driven trading, and steps were taken *-2 *PRO* to better link the stock and futures markets.
Few changes were made *-1 in the way 0 the markets are regulated *-2 *T*-3.
At the outset the prime target was program trading, which *T*-1 was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill.
There were also calls 0 *PRO* to strip the stock markets of "derivative" products, such as stock - index futures and options, which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin, for example, likened *T*-1 to "barnacles attached to the basic market *T*-2."
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange's system of *PRO* having stock trades flow through specialists, or market makers.
When the Brady Task Force's powerful analysis of the crash was released *-1 in January 1988 *T*-2, it immediately reshaped the reformers' agenda.
*PRO*-2 Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one, and concluding that the crash had "raised the possibility of a full - scale financial system breakdown," the presidential task force called for *PRO* establishing a super-regulator *PRO*-1 to oversee the markets, *PRO*-1 to make margins consistent across markets, *PRO*-1 to unify clearing systems and *PRO*-1 to install circuit breakers.
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented *-1.
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm's length and named a second panel--the Working Group on the Financial Markets--*PRO*-1 to review its analysis and those of other crash studies.
In May 1988, the Working Group, made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finally endorsed only circuit breakers.
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets, circuit breakers were set *-1 in place, with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Privately, some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists.
After all, this free - market argument went 0 *?*, the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century.
"Circuit breakers" set * *PRO* to soften big drops:
-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening, contract trading pauses for 10 minutes.
-- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening, contract trading pauses for 10 minutes.
-- If S&P futures fall 12 points (equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA), trading is frozen *-1 for half hour to that price or higher.
On NYSE program trades are diverted *-1 into a separate computer file *PRO* to determine *PRO* buy and sell orders.
-- If S&P futures fall 30 points, trading is restricted *-1 for an hour to that price or higher.
-- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points, trading on the Big Board halts for an hour.
S&P and MMI contracts also halt.
-- If DJIA drops 400 points, Big Board halts trading for two hours.
Trading in MMI and S&P futures also halted.
Brady Task Force recommendations (Jan. 1988):
-- *PRO* Establish an overarching regulator for financial markets
-- *PRO* Unify trade - clearing systems
-- *PRO* Make margins consistent across stock and futures markets
SEC proposals (May 1988):
-- *PRO* Require prompt reports of large securities trades.
-- *PRO* Give SEC authority *PRO* to monitor risk - taking by affiliates of brokerage firms.
-- *PRO* Transfer jurisdiction over stock - related futures to SEC from CFTC.
(*PRO* Opposed *-1 by new SEC chairman)

Congressional proposal:
-- *PRO* Create a task force 0 *T*-1 to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws.
*PRO*-1 Breaking the Soviet government's television monopoly, an independent company has gained rights *PRO* to show world programming, including American films.
"There must not be a monopoly, there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers," Nikolai I. Lutsenko, the president of the Nika TV company, told the weekly newspaper Nedelya *T*-1.
The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes *PRO*-1 to be on the air regularly in about a year, the newspaper said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the U.S. *PRO*-1 to pick up the rights *PRO* to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union.
Nedelya's article was accompanied *-1 by a picture of Mr. Lutsenko interviewing singer John Denver in Colorado.
Even though it will be independent of official television, Nika will have an oversight board that *T*-1 will include members of the Communist youth league.
South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
De Beers said that workers at five of the group's mines were on strike, which it said 0 *T*-1 was peaceful, with orderly picketing occurring at one of the mines.
The deadlock in negotiations occurred with De Beers offering a 17% increase in the minimum - wage category while the union demanded a 37.6% increase in the minimum wage.
Japan's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been bribed *-1 by pinball - parlor owners.
The allegation had been raised *-1 in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from Japanese - style pinball, called * *PRO*-2 pachinko, had infiltrated politics.
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Socialist Party, acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the pachinko association totaling 8 million yen (about $55,000 *U*) but said 0 the donations were legal and none of its members acted *PRO*-1 to favor the industry.
The World Wide Fund for Nature said that Spain, Argentina, Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little 0 *T*-1 to prevent illegal trade in endangered wildlife across their borders.
A report by the conservation group presented * at the U.N. - sponsored Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne accused the four of *PRO*-1 trading protected species ranging from parakeets to orchids.
Fund official Simon Lyster said 0 world trade in wildlife was estimated *-1 to total $5 billion *U* of business annually.
A NATO project 0 *T*-2 to build a frigate for the 1990s was torpedoed *-1 by the pull - out of three of its eight participating nations.
Britain, France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing, but some officials pointed to growing reluctance *ICH*-1 among the allies *PRO* to commit themselves to big defense spending while East - West disarmament talks show signs of success.
Small wonder that Britain's Labor Party wants credit controls.
A few hours after the party launched its own affinity credit card earlier this month, the Tories raised the nation's base interest rate.
Labor's Visa card is believed *-1 to be the first linked * to a British political party.
Labor gets 25 pence (39 cents) for every 100 (about $155 *U*) that a user charges *T*-1 to the card.
As with other plastic in Britain's high - interest - rate environment, the Labor card, administered * by Co-operative Bank, carries a stiff (in this case, 29.8%) annual rate on the unpaid balance.
China's year - long austerity program has achieved some successes in *PRO* harnessing runaway economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed *-1 to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an alarming drain on state budgets.
The official China Daily said 0 retail prices of non-staple foods haven't risen since last December but acknowledged 0 that huge government subsidies were a main factor in *PRO* keeping prices down.
The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan ($270 million *U*) was spent *-1 in the first half of the year for pork subsidies.
The newspaper quoted experts as *PRO*-1 saying 0 the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to "become very unreasonable" and reduce needed funds for investment in the "already difficult state budget."
The aim of the austerity measures was *PRO* to slice economic growth, which *T*-1 soared to 20.7% last year, to 8% in 1990.
Economists now predict 0 the growth rate will be about 11.5% for the year.
In a sign of growing official tolerance for religion, Russian Orthodox priests were allowed *-2 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Moscow patriarchate in the Kremlin's 15th - century Uspensky Cathedral, where czars were crowned *-1 *T*-3....
A 34 - foot - tall, $7.7 million *U* statue of Buddha was completed *-1 on a hill outside Hong Kong, facing China.
The statue is the brainchild of Sik Chi Wan, director of the Po Lin Monastery, who *T*-1 said: "Hong Kong is such a prosperous place, 0 we also need some kind of religious symbol.
The debate over National Service has begun again.
After a decade in which more than 50 localities established their own service or conservation corps and dozens of school systems made community service a prerequisite to high - school graduation *T*-1, the focus has shifted to Washington.
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced *-1 in Congress this spring.
One, co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga .) and Rep. Dave McCurdy (D., Okla.), would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who *T*-1 had served.
An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), and including some diluted Nunn - McCurdy provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic Sens. Claiborne Pell, Barbara Mikulski and Christopher Dodd, has been reported *-1 out of the Senate Labor Committee.
It might well win Senate passage.
President Bush has outlined his own Youth Entering Service (YES) plan, though its details remain *-2 to be specified *-1.
What is one *PRO*-2 to think *T*-1 of all this?
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses.
People eager *PRO* to have youth "pay their dues to society" favor service proposals--preferably mandatory ones.
So do *T*-2 those who *T*-1 seek a "re-energized concept of citizenship," a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights.
Then there are instinctive opponents.
To libertarians, mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money.
Devotees of the market question the value of the work 0 national service would perform *T*-1:
If the market won't pay for it, they argue, it can't be worth its cost.
Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed *-1; they see service as a cover for the draft, or fear the regimentation of youth, or want *PRO*-2 to see rights enlarged *-3, not obligations *?* *-4.
But what about those of us whose views *T*-2 are not predetermined *-1 by formula or ideology?
How should we think about national service *T*-1?
*PRO* Let's begin by *PRO*-1 recognizing a main source of confusion--"national service" has no agreed meaning.
Would service be voluntary or compulsory?
Short or long?
Part - time or full - time?
Paid or unpaid?
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands?
What kinds of work would they do *T*-1?
What does "national" mean *T*-1?
Would the program be run by the federal government, by local governments, or by private voluntary organizations?
And who *T*-1 would serve?
Only males, as with the draft, or both sexes?
Youth only or all ages?
Middle - class people, or poor people, or a genuine cross-section?
Many or few?
Those are not trivial questions, and the label "national service" answers none of them.
Then how should we think about national service *T*-1?
As a starting point, here are five propositions: 1 . *PRO* Consider the ingredients, not the name.
*PRO* Ignore "national service" in the abstract; *PRO* consider specific proposals.
They will differ in crucial ways.
2 . "Service" should be service.
As *PRO* commonly understood *-1, service implies sacrifice.
It involves *PRO* accepting risk, or *PRO* giving up income, or *PRO* deferring a career.
It follows that proposals like Nunn - McCurdy, whose benefits to enrollees *T*-1 are worth some $17,500 *U* a year, do not qualify.
There is a rationale for such bills: Federal subsidies to college students amount to "a GI Bill without the GI"; arguably those benefits should be earned *-1, not given *-1.
But the earnings exceed by 20% the average income of young high - school graduates with full - time jobs.
Why *PRO* call that *PRO*-2 service *T*-1?
3 . Encouragement is fine; compulsion is not *?*.
Compelled service is unconstitutional.
It is also unwise and unenforceable.
(Who *T*-1 will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year?)
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior.
It should also encourage service--preferably by all classes and all ages.
Its encouragement should strengthen *RNR*-1 and not undercut *RNR*-1 the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S., should build on the service programs already in existence, and should honor local convictions about which tasks *T*-2 most need doing.
4 . Good programs are not cheap.
Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply: forest fires fought *-1, housing rehabilitated *-2, students tutored *-3, day - care centers staffed *-4.
There is important work 0 *T*-3 to be done *-1, and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who *T*-2 start with few skills can do much of it well--but not cheaply.
Good service programs require recruitment, screening, training and supervision--all of high quality.
They involve stipends to participants.
Full - time residential programs also require housing and full - time supervision; they are particularly expensive--more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale.
Non-residential programs are cheaper, but good ones still come to some $10,000 *U* a year.
Are they worth that?
Evaluations suggest that good ones are *?*--especially so if the effects on participants are counted *-1.
But the calculations are challengeable.
5 . Underclass youth are a special concern.
Are such expenditures worthwhile, then?
Yes, if *PRO* targeted *-1.
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged *-1 *PRO*-2 to serve, but there are many ways for middle - class kids, and their elders, to serve at little public cost.
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions, or participate in service programs required * by high schools or encouraged * by colleges or employers.
Underclass youth don't have those opportunities.
They are not enrolled in high school or college.
They are unlikely *-2 to be employed *-1.
And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances, among family structures breaking down, *PRO*-1 surrounded by self - destructive behaviors and bleak prospects.
But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented *-1 by productive and disciplined service.
Some won't accept the discipline; others drop out for other reasons.
But some whom nothing else is reaching *T*-2 are transformed *-1.
*PRO* Learning skills, producing something cooperatively, feeling useful, they are no longer dependent--others now depend on them.
Even if it *EXP*-1 is cheaper *PRO* to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune - grass with paid professionals, the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation.
*PRO* Strictly speaking, these youth are not performing service.
They are giving up no income, deferring no careers, incurring no risk.
But they believe themselves to be serving, and they begin *-1 to respect themselves (and others), to take control of their lives, to think of the future.
That is a service to the nation.
It is what federal support should try hardest *PRO*-2 to achieve *T*-1.
Mr. Szanton, a Carter administration budget official, heads his own Washington - based strategic planning firm.
He is a co-author of "National Service: What Would It Mean *T*-1?"
(Lexington Books, 1986).
Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year - ago levels in early October, the first sales period of the 1990 model year.
The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American - made cars in the first 10 days of October, a 12.6% drop from a year earlier.
Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4% to 86,555 pickups, vans and sport utility vehicles.
The heavy use of incentives *PRO* to clear out 1989 models appears *-2 to have taken the steam, at least initially, out of 1990 model sales, which *T*-1 began officially Oct. 1.
This appears *-2 particularly true at GM, which *T*-1 had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3% from last year's unusually high level.
Overall, sales of all domestic - made vehicles fell 11.9% from a year ago.
Without GM, overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results.
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models, but they may have *-1 to broaden their programs *PRO*-1 to keep sales up.
"We've created a condition where, without incentives, it's a tough market *T*-2," said *T*-1 Tom Kelly, sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn, Mich.
Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles, the lowest since October 1987.
The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month.
Furthermore, dealers contacted late last week said 0 they couldn't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday's steep market decline.
GM's domestic car sales dropped 24.3% and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7% from the same period a year ago.
All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines.
Cadillac posted a 3.2% increase despite new competition from Lexus, the fledging luxury - car division of Toyota Motor Corp.
Lexus sales weren't available; the cars are imported *-1 and Toyota reports their sales only at month - end.
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused *-3 in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered *T*-1 in addition to consumer rebates and low - interest financing, a company spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
Last year, GM had a different program *ICH*-3 in place that *T*-2 continued *-4 rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold *-1.
Aside from GM, other car makers posted generally mixed results.
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8% drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4% increase in domestic truck sales.
Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5% drop in car sales, *PRO* echoing its generally slow performance all year.
However, sales of trucks, including the company's popular minivans, rose 4.3%.
Honda Motor Co.'s sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7% from a year earlier.
Honda's plant in Marysville, Ohio, was gearing up *PRO*-2 to build 1990 model Accords, a Honda spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
"We're really confident 0 everything will bounce back to normal," he added *T*-1.
Separately, Chrysler said 0 firm prices on its 1990 - model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5% over comparably equipped 1989 models.
Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced * earlier this fall.
At that time, Chrysler said 0 base prices, which *T*-2 aren't adjusted *-1 for equipment changes, would rise between 4% and 9% *U* on most vehicle.
a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported * in period.
c - Domestic car
d - Percentage change is greater than 999%.
x - There were 8 selling days in the most recent period and 8 a year earlier.
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume.
The market for $200 billion *U* of high - risk junk bonds, *PRO*-1 battered * by a succession of defaults and huge price declines this year, practically vanished Friday.
Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed *PRO*-1 to sell bonds, only *PRO* to find themselves deserted *-2 by potential buyers.
*PRO*-1 Stunned, they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while *PRO* being able *PRO* to execute very few actual trades.
"The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now--there are no bids, only offers," says *T*-3 independent investor Martin D. Sass, who *T*-1 manages nearly $4 billion *U* and who *T*-2 recently decided *PRO*-4 to buy distressed securities for a new fund.
This calamity is "far from over," he says 0 *T*-1.
Junk's collapse helped *PRO* stoke the panicky selling of stocks that *T*-1 produced the deepest one - day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19, 1987, crash.
Simultaneously, it also helped *PRO* trigger this year's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed *PRO*-3 to move capital into the highest - quality securities 0 they could find *T*-1.
But "an eerie silence pervaded" the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high - yield bonds despite "no active trading," says *T*-1 John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
For example, the price of Southland Corp.'s $500 million *U* of 16 3/4% bonds due 2002--sold * less than two years ago by Goldman, Sachs & Co.--plummeted 25% to just 30 cents on the dollar.
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland, the owner of the nationwide chain of 7 - 11 convenience stores that *T*-13 is strapped *-12 for cash.
Goldman officials declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Junk bonds, which *T*-1 mushroomed from less than $2 billion *U* at the start of this decade, have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments.
The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which *T*-1 created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing.
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that *T*-1 caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department - store chain up for sale.
Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services and York International, that *T*-1 are counting on at least $7 billion *U* of scheduled new junk financings *PRO*-2 to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy - outs *PRO*-3 afloat, may never get the money.
"The music has stopped *-2 playing," says *T*-1 Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins.
"You've either got a chair or you don't *?*."
In Friday's aftermath, says 0 *?* R. Douglas Carleton, a director of high - yield finance at First Boston Corp., "much of the $7 billion *U* forward calendar could be deferred *-1, depending on the hysteria."
In August, First Boston withdrew a $475 million *U* junk offering of Ohio Mattress bonds because potential buyers were "very skittish."
The outlook "looks shaky because we're still waiting" for mutual funds, in particular, to dump some of their junk bond holdings *PRO* to pay off redemptions by individual investors, says 0 *T*-1 King Penniman, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services.
Indeed, a Moody's index that *T*-1 tracks the net asset values of 24 high - yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday.
In a stark contrast, the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1/2 points, or about $25 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, to 103 12/32, its biggest gain of the year.
The bond's yield dropped to 7.82%, the lowest since March 31, 1987, according to Technical Data Global Markets Group.
The yield on three - month Treasury bills, considered the safest of all investments, plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16%, the largest one - day decline since 1982.
The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"When you get panic in one market *T*-1, you get flight to quality in the other," said *T*-2 Maria Ramirez, money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
Nevertheless, the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve *PRO*-1 to ease credit in the months ahead.
"This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook," says *T*-1 William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York.
Any sustained credit - easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities.
Robert Dow, a partner and portfolio manager at Lord, Abbett & Co., which *T*-1 manages $4 billion *U* of high - yield bonds, says 0 he doesn't "think 0 there is any fundamental economic rationale {for the junk bond rout}.
It was herd instinct."
He adds: "The junk market has witnessed some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets creamed *-1 that means 0 the economy will be terrible and that's bad for junk.
I don't believe 0 that's the case, but I believe that people are running *PRO*-1 scared.
There is a flight to quality, and the quality is not in equities and not in junk--it's in Treasurys."
Even as trading in high - yield issues dried up over the past month, corporations sold more than $2 billion *U* of new junk bonds.
For example, a recent $375 million *U* offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold * by First Boston was three times oversubscribed.
A $550 million *U* offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high - yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased *-1 $50 million *U* because of strong demand.
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone, junk bond investors will receive $4.8 billion *U* of coupon interest payments.
"That's a clear indication that there is *RNR*-1 and will be *RNR*-1 an undercurrent of basic business going on," says *T*-2 Mr. Carleton of First Boston.
"I don't know how people can say 0 the junk bond market disappeared *T*-3 when there were $1.5 billion *U* of orders for $550 million *U* of junk bonds sold last week by Turner *T*-2," says *T*-1 Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co.
"When the rally comes *T*-1, insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions 0 *PRO* to invest *T*-3 and invest they will *T*-2.
There is plenty of money available from people who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to buy well - structured deals; it *EXP*-4's the stuff that *T*-2's financed on a shoestring that people are wary of *T*-5."
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed *-1 to have multiplied this year, *PRO* casting a pall over much of the junk market.
Michael McNamara, director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services, says 0 the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer, *PRO* contributing to the slide in prices.
"Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals," he says *T*-1.
"This year, at best, it's in one in every five or six.
And our credit standards haven't changed one iota."
However, Mr. McNamara said 0 the slide in junk is creating "one hell of a buying opportunity" for selective buyers.
For the moment, investors seem *-1 more preoccupied with the "bad" junk than the "good" junk.
"The market has been weak since" the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York, says *T*-1 Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch.
"That really affected the market in that people started *-2 to ask ` What else *T*-1 is in trouble?"'
Well before Campeau, though, there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever.
Despite the relatively strong economy, junk bond prices did nothing except go down, *PRO*-1 hammered *-2 by a seemingly endless trail of bad news:
-- In June, two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $1.2 billion *U* of speculative debt securities, New York - based Integrated Resources Inc. said 0 it ran out of borrowed money.
-- In July, Southmark Corp., the Dallas - based real estate and financial services company with about $1.3 billion *U* of junk bonds, voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law.
-- By the end of July, the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven - year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points.
-- In August, Resorts International Inc., which *T*-1 sold more than $500 million *U* of junk bonds, suspended interest payments.
-- In September, just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau, Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $145 million *U* of notes and appeared *-1 unlikely *PRO*-2 to pay interest on a total of $1.2 billion *U* of debt securities.
Meantime, regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush *PRO* to leverage shows no signs of *PRO*-1 abating.
Moody's says 0 the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982.
In addition, there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
"The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it," says *T*-1 James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, an early critic of the junk bond market.
"What we've begun *-1 to see *T*-2 is the damage to businesses of *PRO* paying exorbitant compound interest.
Businesses were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings.
What we're seeing *T*-1 now is the wrenching readjustment of asset values to a future when speculative - grade debt will be hard *PRO* to obtain rather than easy *?* *T*-2."
Friday's Market Activity
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market.
The benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond was quoted *-1 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12/32, compared * with 100 27/32 Thursday, up 2 1/2 points.
The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82%, the lowest since March 31, 1987, according to Technical Data Global Markets Group.
The "flight to quality" began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market.
Treasurys opened lower, *PRO*-1 reacting negatively to news that the producer price index--a measure of inflation on the wholesale level--accelerated in September.
Bond prices barely budged until midday.
Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve, which *T*-1 might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity *PRO* to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from *PRO*-2 slowing into a recession.
Prices of municipals, investment - grade corporates and mortgage - backed bonds also rose, but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts.
Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading, with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9% coupon securities, the most liquid mortgage issue.
The Ginnie Mae November 9% issue ended at 98 25/32, up 7/8 point on the day, *PRO*-1 to yield about 9.28% to a 12 - year average life assumption.
Investment - grade corporate bonds were up about 1/2 to 3/4 point.
But the yield spread between lower - quality, investment - grade issues and higher - quality bonds widened.
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment - grade bonds in anticipation of this week's $3 billion *U* bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Despite rumors that the TVA's long - awaited offering would be postponed *-1 because of the debacle in the equity markets, sources in the underwriting syndicate said 0 they expect 0 the issue will be priced *-2 as *PRO* scheduled.
One of the sources said 0 the smaller portions of $750 million *U* each of five - year and 10 - year bonds have already been "substantially oversubscribed *-1."
Municipal bonds rose as much as 3/4 point.
Roger Lowenstein contributed to this article.
The economy's temperature will be taken *-1 from several vantage points this week, with readings on trade, output, housing and inflation.
The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow.
The trade gap is expected *-1 to widen to about $9 billion *U* from July's $7.6 billion *U*, according to a survey by MMS International, a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc., New York.
Thursday's report on the September consumer price index is expected *-1 to rise, although not as sharply as the 0.9% gain reported * Friday in the producer price index.
That gain was being cited *-1 as a reason 0 the stock market was down early in Friday's session, before it got *-2 started *-4 on its reckless 190 - point plunge *T*-3.
Economists are divided *-1 as to how much manufacturing strength they expect *PRO*-2 to see *T*-3 in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization, also due tomorrow.
Meanwhile, September housing starts, due Wednesday, are thought *-1 to have inched upward.
"There's a possibility of a surprise" in the trade report, said 0 *T*-1 Michael Englund, director of research at MMS.
A widening of the deficit, if it were combined *-1 with a stubbornly strong dollar, would exacerbate trade problems--but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted.
In any event, Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in *PRO* narrowing the trade gap have already been made *-1.
"Trade is definitely going *-3 to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins *-1 to slow," he said *T*-2.
Exports are thought *-1 to have risen strongly in August, but probably not enough *PRO* to offset the jump in imports, economists said *T*-2.
Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who *T*-1 read September's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who *T*-2 use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations.
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences: The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5% to an increase of 0.4%, according to MMS.
A rebound in energy prices, which *T*-1 helped push up the producer price index, is expected *-2 to do the same in the consumer price report.
The consensus view expects a 0.4% increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August.
Robert H. Chandross, an economist for Lloyd's Bank in New York, is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level.
"Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI, and at the CPI level they won't *?*," he said *T*-1.
Food prices are expected *-2 to be unchanged, but energy costs jumped as much as 4%, said 0 *T*-1 Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet / Norstar Financial Group.
He also says 0 he thinks 0 "core inflation," which *T*-1 excludes the volatile food and energy prices, was strong last month.
He expects a gain of as much as 0.5% in core inflation after a summer of far smaller increases.
Housing starts are expected * to quicken a bit from August's annual pace of 1,350,000 units.
Economists say 0 an August rebound in permits for multifamily units signaled an increase in September starts, though activity remains fairly modest by historical standards.
Hammond Co., Newport Beach, Calif., said 0 Fidelity National Financial Inc. extended its previous agreement, under which it won't purchase any more of the mortgage banker's common stock *T*-1, through Oct. 31.
The previous agreement expired Thursday.
Hammond said that its discussions with Fidelity, an Irvine, Calif., title - insurance underwriter, are continuing, but that prospects for a longer - term standstill agreement are uncertain.
Fidelity has increased its stake in Hammond to 23.57% in recent months.
Statements made * in Securities and Exchange Commission filings led Hammond *PRO*-1 to request a standstill agreement.
Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday.
After 26 years in prison, Mr. Sisulu, the 77 - year - old former secretary - general of the liberation movement, was dropped *-1 off at his house by a prison services' van just as the sun was coming up.
At the same time, six ANC colleagues, five of whom *T*-2 were arrested *-3 with him in 1963 and sentenced *-3 to life imprisonment, were reunited *-1 with their families at various places around the country.
And as the graying men returned to their homes, the ANC, outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered *PRO* to be the chief public enemy by the white government, defiantly returned to the streets of the country's black townships.
A huge ANC flag, with black, green and gold stripes, was hoisted *-1 over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu's modest house, while on the street out front, boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts, caps and scarves.
At the small four - room home of Elias Motsoaledi, a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, well - wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped * in ANC ribbons.
"I am happy *PRO* to see the spirit of the people," said *T*-1 Mr. Sisulu, *PRO*-2 looking dapper in a new gray suit.
As the crowd outside his home shouted "ANC, ANC," the old man shot his fists into the air.
"I'm inspired *-1 by the mood of the people."
Under the laws of the land, the ANC remains an illegal organization, and its headquarters are still in Lusaka, Zambia.
But the unconditional release of the seven leaders, who *T*-1 once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC, is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing.
"The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again," said *T*-1 Cassim Saloojee, a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand *PRO* to welcome Mr. Sisulu.
"Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now.
There's no *PRO* turning back."
There was certainly no *PRO* stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night, when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what *T*-1 became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years *T*-2.
Deafening chants of "ANC" and "Umkhonto we Sizwe" shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts, including the armed struggle.
And they called on the government to release Nelson Mandela, the ANC's leading figure, who *T*-1 was jailed with them and remains in prison.
Without him, said 0 *?* Mr. Sisulu, the freeing of the others "is only a half - measure."
President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men--along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival liberation group--as part of his efforts *PRO* to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed * at *PRO* giving blacks a voice in national government *T*-1.
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country.
As other repressive governments, particularly Poland and the Soviet Union, have recently discovered, initial steps *PRO* to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that *T*-1 becomes difficult *RNR*-2, if not impossible *RNR*-2, *PRO* to control.
As the days go by, the South African government will be ever more hard pressed *PRO* to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency.
If it doesn't yield on these matters, and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC, the expectations and promise raised * by yesterday's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest.
If it does, the large number of right - wing whites, who *T*-1 oppose any concessions to the black majority, will step up their agitation and threats *PRO* to take matters into their own hands.
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure.
The government is watching closely *PRO*-2 to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence; if it does, Pretoria will use this as a reason 0 *PRO* to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars *T*-1.
Pretoria hasn't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place: for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government *T*-1.
In addition, the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who *T*-1 have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment.
In order *PRO* to head off any divisions, Mr. Mandela, in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released *-1, instructed them *PRO*-2 to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible.
The men also will be faced *-1 with *PRO* bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country's many militant black youths, the so - called young lions who *T*-2 are anxious *PRO* to see the old lions in action.
Says Peter Mokaba, president of the South African Youth Congress: "We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC."
They never considered themselves to be anything else.
At last night's rally, they called on their followers to be firm, yet disciplined, in their opposition to apartheid.
"We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very, very sensitive," said *T*-2 Andrew Mlangeni, another early Umkhonto leader who *T*-1 is now 63.
"We want *PRO*-2 to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison, and if we aren't disciplined *-1 we may not see them here with us.
Business Week subscribers may hear this week's issue talking back to them.
A four - page ad from Texas Instruments Inc., running in approximately 140,000 issues of the Oct. 20 "Corporate Elite" issue of the McGraw - Hill Inc. publication, contains a speech synthesizer laminated * between two of the pages.
Readers who *T*-1 pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny--but distinctly human - sounding--voice announce, "I am the talking chip," as it launches into a 15 - second discourse on its own attributes.
The talking chip isn't cheap--the per - ad cost to Texas Instruments is about $4 *U*, and that's without *PRO* adding in Business Week's charge--but Texas Instruments believes 0 it is a first.
Previous efforts have included musical ads, featuring simple tone - generating chips that *T*-1 play a tune, but the voice synthesizer in this effort is much more sophisticated, with none of the robotic flatness that one hears *T*-2, for example, when *PRO*-4 calling telephone directory services *T*-3.
And for those who *T*-1 miss the message the first time around, not *PRO* to worry: Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 replays.
Friday's 190 - point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that *T*-3 dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash, and mechanisms have been put *-2 in place *PRO* to keep markets more orderly.
Still, the lesson is about the same: On Friday the 13th, the market was spooked *-1 by Washington.
The consensus along the street seems *-2 to be that the plunge was triggered *-1 by the financing problems of the UAL takeover, and it's certainly true 0 the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt.
Still, the consensus *ICH*-2 seems *-3 almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason 0 *PRO* to write down the value of all U.S. business *T*-1.
This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn: the success of Senate Democrats in *PRO* stalling the capital gains tax cut.
The real value of all shares, after all, is directly impacted *-1 by the tax on any profits (all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that *T*-2 show 0 gains are not "ordinary income").
And market expectations clearly have been raised *-1 by the capital gains victory in the House last month.
An hour before Friday's plunge, that provision was stripped *-1 from the tax bill, *PRO* leaving it with $5.4 billion *U* in tax increases without a capital gains cut.
There is a great deal 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1, *PRO* to be sure, for *PRO* stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill.
It would be a good thing if Congress started *-1 to decide issues one - by - one on their individual merits without trickery.
For one thing, no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up - or - down vote.
Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens, promises of a cleaner bill are suspect.
Especially so since President Bush has been weakened *-1 by the Panama fiasco.
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge *T*-1, they are another instance of Washington's sticky fingers.
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted *-1 of course, at some point the market will start *-2 to reject them.
But the airlines are scarcely a clear case, *PRO* given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner, who *T*-2 professes *PRO*-4 to believe 0 safety will be compromised *-1 if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that *T*-3 fly airplanes.
Worse, Congress has started *-1 to jump on the Skinner bandwagon.
James Oberstar, the Minnesota Democrat who *T*-2 chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed *-1 in time *PRO* to affect the American and United Air Lines bids.
It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days 0 *PRO* to "review" any bid for 15% or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $1 billion *U* or more *T*-1.
So the UAL deal has problems, and the market loses 190 points.
Congratulations, Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman.
In the 1987 crash, *PRO* remember, the market was shaken *-1 by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal *PRO* to tax takeovers out of existance.
Even more important, in our view, was *T*-1 the Treasury's threat *PRO* to thrash the dollar.
The Treasury is doing the same thing today; thankfully, the dollar is not under 1987 - style pressure.
Also, traders are in better shape *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 today than in 1987 *PRO* to survive selling binges.
They are better capitalized *-1.
They are in less danger of *PRO*-1 losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays.
The Fed promises any needed liquidity.
The Big Board's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved; it *EXP*-1 will be interesting *PRO* to learn if "circuit breakers" prove *-2 to be a good idea.
In any event, some traders see stocks as underpriced today, unlike 1987.
There is nothing wrong with the market that *T*-2 can't be cured *-1 by a little coherence and common sense in Washington.
But on the bearish side, that may be too much 0 *PRO* to expect *T*-1.
Trinity Industries Inc. said 0 it reached a preliminary agreement *PRO* to manufacture 1,000 coal rail cars for Norfolk Southern Corp.
Trinity estimated the value of the pact at more than $40 million *U*.
Trinity said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to begin delivery of the rail cars in the first quarter of 1990.
It said 0 the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the 1,450 coal rail cars presently being produced for Norfolk Southern, a Norfolk, Va. - based railroad concern.
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced 0 they have completed a 100 million - mark ($52.2 million *U*) joint venture *PRO* to produce electronics parts.
In the venture's first fiscal year, Siemens will hold 74.9% of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary, Matsushita Electronic Components Co., 25.1%.
A basic agreement between the two companies was announced *-1 in June.
The new company is *-2 to be called *-1 *PRO*-3 Siemens Matsushita Components G.m.b . H.
It will have its headquarters in Munich.
Matsushita's share in the venture will rise to 35% Oct. 1, 1990, and to 50% the following Oct. 1.
Siemens will retain majority voting rights.
The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year, Matsushita said 0 *T*-1.
Sales are expected *-1 to rise to one billion marks after four years.
The company will have production facilities in West Germany, Austria, France and Spain.
Striking auto workers ended their 19 - day occupation of a metal shop at a Peugeot S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital.
But the Peugeot breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees disrupted border checkpoints and threatened the government's ability *PRO* to pay its bills.
The Peugeot metalworkers began *-2 filing out of the shop, which *T*-1 makes auto parts, at the plant in Mulhouse after *PRO* voting 589 to 193 *PRO*-3 to abandon the occupation.
Their withdrawal was based *-1 on promises *ICH*-2 by Peugeot *PRO* to open negotiations in Paris at the same time 0 the last man left the premises *T*-3.
The strike by customs officers, tax collectors, treasury workers and other civil servants attached * to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average Frenchman.
Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid *-1 because of a complex job - rating system 0 they say 0 *T*-2 fails *-3 to take into account their education and level of technical expertise.
Axa - Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $4.5 billion *U* acquisition of Farmers Group Inc., in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates *T*-1.
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services concern that *T*-1 is parent of Los Angeles - based Farmers.
In an attempt *PRO* to appease U.S. regulators' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers, Sir James in August agreed *PRO*-1 to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in *PRO*-2 acquiring B.A.T.
As part of the agreement, Axa agreed *PRO*-1 to invest $1 billion *U* in Hoylake Investments Ltd., Sir James's acquisition vehicle.
Of the total $5.5 billion *U* 0 *T*-4 to be paid *-3 to Hoylake by Axa, about $1 billion *U* *T*-1 will come from available resources of Axa's parent, Axa - Midi Group, $2.25 billion *U* *T*-1 will be in the form of notes issued * by Axa, and the remaining $2.25 billion *U* *T*-1 will be in long - term bank loans.
In an interview Thursday, Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer of Axa, said 0 his group has already obtained assurances *ICH*-1 from a group of banks led * by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing.
The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp, he said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Bebear said 0 Axa - Midi Group has "more than $2.5 billion *U* of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell" *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to help *PRO* pay off debt from the acquisition.
He said 0 the assets 0 *T*-2 to be sold *-3 would be "non-insurance" assets, including a beer company and a real estate firm, and wouldn't include any pieces of Farmers.
"We won't put any burden on Farmers," he said *T*-1.
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement, Hoylake has an absolute obligation *PRO* to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T.
"We hope that with what we did *T*-1, the regulators will not need *-2 to evaluate Hoylake, and they can directly look at the agreement with us, because Hoylake won't be an owner of Farmers at anytime," Mr. Bebear said *T*-3.
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated *-1 *T*-2.
The amended filings were required *-1 because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake, and *PRO* to reflect the extension that Sir James received *T*-2 last month under British takeover rules *PRO* to complete his proposed acquisition.
Hoylake dropped its initial #13.35 billion *U* ($20.71 billion *U*) takeover bid after it received the extension, but said 0 it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval *T*-1.
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that, "It would appear that nothing substantive has changed.
The new financing structure is still a very - highly leveraged one, and Axa still plans *PRO*-1 to take out 75% of Farmers' earnings as dividends *PRO*-2 to service their debt."
That dividend is almost double the 35% currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T, the spokesman added 0 *T*-1.
"It would have severe implications for Farmers' policy holders."
*PRO*-2 To fend off Sir James's advances, B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that *T*-1 would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern.
It wasn't so long ago that a radio network funded * by the U.S. Congress--and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency--was accused *-1 by officials here of *PRO*-3 employing propagandists, imperialists and spies *T*-2.
Now, the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital.
Employees held an open house *PRO*-1 to celebrate and even hung out a sign: "Szabad Europa Radio"--Radio Free Europe.
"I think 0 this is a victory for the radio," says *T*-2 Barnabas de Bueky, a 55 - year - old former Hungarian refugee who *T*-1 works in the Munich, West Germany, headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service.
In fact, the network hopes *PRO*-2 to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that *T*-1 will have it.
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network's life in more ways than one.
In fact, Radio Free Europe is in danger of *PRO*-1 suffering from its success.
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest, so can *?* *T*-1 others.
In addition, competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when *PRO* broadcasting here was strictly controlled *-3 *T*-2.
Instead of *PRO*-2 being denounced *-1 as an evil agent of imperialism, Radio Free Europe is more likely *-2 to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame, even boring.
"They have a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 these days *PRO*-3 to compete with Hungarian radio," says *T*-1 Andrew Deak, a computer - science student at the Technical University in Budapest.
"The Hungarian {radio} reporters seem *-2 better informed and more critical about about what *T*-1's going on here."
Indeed, Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion.
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe.
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines.
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder.
The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves, though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian.
Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50% stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers, while Britain's Robert Maxwell has let it *EXP*-2 be known *-1 here that he is thinking about similar moves.
But Radio Free Europe doesn't plan *PRO*-1 to fade away.
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way, the network's staff says 0 it still has plenty 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1--in Hungary and in the "Great Eastern Beyond."
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union, Radio Liberty, say 0 they won't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts.
They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues: from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz.
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe.
Months before the decision *ICH*-1 by the Hungarian Communist Party *PRO* to rename itself *PRO*-4 Socialist and try *PRO*-2 to look more appealing to voters, the country's rulers were trying *PRO*-3 to look more hospitable.
It proved *-1 a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission *PRO* to set up office.
Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe's new location, but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing: "They found us four phone lines in central Budapest," says *T*-2 Geza Szocs, a Radio Free Europe correspondent who *T*-1 helped *PRO* organize the Budapest location.
"That is a miracle."
It's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network, which *T*-1 had *-3 to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents (who *T*-2 filed reports to the network by phone, secret messengers or letters).
In fact, some of the network's Hungarian listeners say 0 they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for *PRO* keeping hope *PRO*-2 alive through what one writer here calls *T*-1 *PRO*-3 the "Dark Ages of the 20th Century."
"During the past four years, many of us have sat up until late at night *PRO*-2 listening to our radios," says *T*-1 the writer.
"There were some very brave broadcasts."
The listeners, too, had *-1 to be brave.
Through much of the post-World War II period, *PRO* listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary.
"When we listen to the Europe station *T*-1, my mother still gets nervous," says *T*-2 a Budapest translator.
"She wants *PRO*-1 to turn down the volume and close the curtains."
Now, the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late - night slot.
Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight.
Television, which most of the time *T*-3 is considered *-1 rather tame, has entered the running with a new program, "The End of the Day," which *T*-2 comes on after 11 p.m.
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who *T*-1 discuss Hungary's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs.
Those who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to hear even more radical views have *-3 to get up at five on Sunday morning for "Sunday Journal," on Hungarian Radio.
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe, which *T*-1 is trying *PRO*-2 to beef up programs.
The Budapest office plans *PRO*-1 to hire free - lance reporters *PRO*-1 to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east.
The Hungarian service has a daily 40 - minute news show called * *PRO*-1 Newsreel, with international and domestic news, plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world.
There's also a host of new programs, trying *PRO* to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics.
A daily 35 - minute program called * *PRO*-2 "The March of Time" tries *PRO*-1 to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world.
There's a program for women and a science show.
And *PRO* to attract younger listeners, Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups.
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest.
"We are starving for all the news," says *T*-1 Mr. Deak, the student.
"Every moment we want *PRO*-1 to know everything about the world.
For 20 years, federal rules have barred the three major television networks from *PRO* sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest - growing parts of the television business.
And for six years, NBC, ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a futile attempt *PRO* to change that.
But with foreign companies snapping up U.S. movie studios, the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever.
They hope 0 the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and prod Congress *PRO*-4 to push for *PRO* ending federal rules that *T*-1 prohibit the networks from *PRO*-3 grabbing a piece of rerun sales and owning part of the shows 0 they put *T*-2 on the air.
Even network executives, however, admit privately that victory--either in Congress or in talks with the studios--is highly doubtful any time soon.
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways 0 *PRO* to sidestep the "fin - syn" provisions, known * formally as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules *T*-1.
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co., backed * by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co., had tried *PRO*-1 to help *PRO* fund Qintex Australia Ltd.'s now - scuttled $1.5 billion *U* bid for MGM / UA Communications Co.
NBC's interest may revive the deal, which MGM / UA killed *T*-1 last week when the Australian concern had trouble *PRO*-3 raising cash *T*-2.
Even if that deal isn't revived *-1, NBC hopes *PRO*-2 to find another.
"Our doors are open," an NBC spokesman says *T*-1.
NBC may yet find a way 0 *PRO* to take a passive, minority interest in a program - maker without *PRO* violating the rules *T*-1.
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC's parent, Capital Cities / ABC Inc., *PRO*-1 to look for ways of *PRO* skirting the fin - syn regulations.
But the networks' push may only aggravate an increasingly bitter rift between them and Hollywood studios.
Both sides are *-1 to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on *PRO* reducing fin - syn restraints *T*-2.
Few people privy to the talks expect the studios to budge.
The networks still are "uninhibited in their authority" over what shows *T*-1 get on the air, charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti, the most vociferous opponent of *PRO* rescinding the rules.
Studios are "powerless" *PRO* to get shows in prime - time lineups and keep them there long enough *PRO* to go into lucrative rerun sales, he contends 0 *T*-1.
And that's why the rules, for the most part, must stay in place *T*-1, he says 0 *T*-2.
Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc., Fries Entertainment Inc., Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc.--declined *PRO*-2 to be interviewed *-1.
But Mr. Valenti, who *T*-1 represents the studios, asserts: "0 The whole production industry, to a man, is on the side of *PRO* preserving" the rules.
Such proclamations leave network officials *PRO*-1 all the more doubtful that the studios will bend.
"They don't seem *-1 to have an incentive *PRO* to negotiate," says *T*-2 one network executive.
"And there's no indication that Washington is prepared *PRO* to address the rules.
That's the problem, isn't it *?*?"
Indeed it is *?*.
Congress has said repeatedly 0 it wants no part of the mess, *PRO*-2 urging the studios and the networks, which *T*-1 license rights to air shows made * by the studios, *PRO*-3 to work out their own compromise.
But recent developments have made the networks--and NBC President Robert Wright, in particular--ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled *PRO*-1 to survive.
The latest provocation: Sony Corp.'s plan *PRO* to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4 billion *U*, and *PRO* to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million *U*.
"I wonder what Walter Cronkite will think *T*-2 of the Sony / Columbia Broadcast System Trinitron Evening News with Dan Rather broadcast * exclusively from Tokyo," wrote *T*-1 J.B. Holston, an NBC vice president, in a commentary in last week's issue of Broadcasting magazine.
In his article, Mr. Holston, who *T*-1 was in Europe last week and unavailable, complained that the "archaic restraints" in fin - syn rules have "contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by non-U.S. enterprises.
" (He didn't mention that NBC, in the meantime, was hoping *PRO*-1 to assist Australia's Qintex in buying
An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston's lament was "entirely consistent" with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as *PRO* to be "light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony--and everyone else except the three networks."
The Big Three's drumbeat for deregulation began *-1 intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans *PRO*-3 to acquire Warner *T*-2.
Although Time already had a long - term contract *PRO* to buy movies from Warner, the merger will let Time's largely unregulated pay - cable channel, Home Box Office, own the Warner movies aired * on HBO--a vertical integration that *T*-2 is effectively blocked *-1 by fin - syn regulations.
NBC's Mr. Wright led the way in *PRO* decrying the networks' inability *PRO* to match a Time - Warner combination.
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced *-1 *T*-2.
Since NBC's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM / UA was disclosed *-1, Mr. Wright hasn't been available for comment.
With a Qintex deal, NBC would move into uncharted territory--*PRO* possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington.
"It's never really been tested *-1," says *T*-2 William Lilley III, who as a top CBS executive *T*-3 spent years *PRO*-4 lobbying *PRO* to have the rules lifted *-5.
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington, *PRO*-1 consulting to media companies.
Fin - syn rules don't explicitly block a network from *PRO* buying a passive, small stake in a company that *T*-1 profits from the rerun syndication 0 networks can't enjoy *T*-2.
Hence, NBC might be able *PRO* to take, *PRO* say, a 5% stake in a company such as MGM / UA.
If the transaction raised objections, the studio's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network doesn't have a direct stake *T*-1.
But such convolutions would still block the networks from *PRO*-1 grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication.
Under current rules, even when a network fares well with a 100% - owned series--ABC, for example, made a killing in *PRO*-2 broadcasting its popular crime / comedy "Moonlighting"--*T*-5 it isn't allowed *-3 to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold *-1 to local stations *T*-4.
Instead, ABC will have *-1 to sell off the rights for a one - time fee.
The networks admit that the chances of *PRO* getting the relief 0 they want *T*-1 are slim--for several years at the least.
Six years ago they were tantalizingly close.
The Reagan - era Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of *PRO* killing most of the rules.
Various evidence, including a Brookings Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired *T*-2 and had partly owned *T*-2 in the 1960s, showed 0 the networks didn't wield undue control over the studios as *PRO* had been alleged *-1.
But just eight days before the rules were *PRO* to die, former President Ronald Reagan, a one - time actor, intervened on behalf of Hollywood.
The FCC effort collapsed.
The networks and studios have bickered ever since.
Network officials involved * in the studio talks may hope 0 the foreign influx builds more support in Washington, but that seems *-1 unlikely.
In Congress, the issue falters: It's about money, not program quality, and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue.
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. Markey (D - Mass.), who *T*-2 heads a subcommittee that *T*-3 oversees the FCC, says 0 Mr. Markey feels "0 the world has been forever changed *-1 by the Sony - Columbia deal."
But he said 0 Mr. Markey hopes 0 this pushes the networks and studios *PRO*-1 to work it out on their own.
And at the FCC, meanwhile, new Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has said 0 he wants the two sides to hammer out their own plan.

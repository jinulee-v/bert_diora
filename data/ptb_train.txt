Eaton Corp. said 0 it sold its Pacific Sierra Research Corp. unit to a company formed * by employees of that unit.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Pacific Sierra, based * in Los Angeles, has about 200 employees and supplies professional services and advanced products to industry.
Eaton is an automotive parts, controls and aerospace electronics concern.
South Korea registered a trade deficit of $101 million *U* in October, *PRO* reflecting the country's economic sluggishness, according to government figures released * Wednesday.
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October, the fifth monthly setback this year, *PRO* casting a cloud on South Korea's export - oriented economy.
Exports in October stood at $5.29 billion *U*, a mere 0.7% increase from a year earlier, while imports increased sharply to $5.39 billion *U*, up 20% from last October.
South Korea's economic boom, which *T*-12 began in 1986, stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes, trade conflicts and sluggish exports.
Government officials said 0 exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $68 billion *U*.
Despite the gloomy forecast, South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $71 million *U* so far this year.
From January to October, the nation's accumulated exports increased 4% from the same period last year to $50.45 billion *U*.
Imports were at $50.38 billion *U*, up 19%.
LTV Corp. said 0 a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed *PRO*-1 to extend until March 8, 1990, the period in which the steel, aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right *PRO* to file a reorganization plan *T*-2.
The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, *PRO* giving it court protection from creditors' lawsuits while it attempts *PRO*-1 to work out a plan *PRO* to pay its debts.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that *T*-30 stand as milestones of American business history.)
THREE COMPUTERS THAT *T*-31 CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched *-32 in 1977.
That year the Apple II, Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS - 80 came to market.
The computers were crude by today's standards.
Apple II owners, for example, had *-1 to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes.
But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I, which *T*-1 was built *-33 in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club.
In addition, the Apple II was an affordable $1,298 *U*.
*PRO*-1 Crude as they were *?*, these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office.
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years.
But the new 1977 PCs--unlike earlier *PRO* built *-1 - from - kit types such as the Altair, Sol and IMSAI--had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories.
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts.
There were many pioneer PC contributors.
William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language - housekeeper system for PCs, and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981.
Alan F. Shugart, currently chairman of Seagate Technology, led the team that *T*-32 developed the disk drives for PCs.
Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington, two Atlanta engineers, were co-developers of the internal modems that *T*-33 allow PCs to share data via the telephone.
IBM, the world leader in computers, didn't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market.
Today, PC shipments annually total some $38.3 billion *U* world - wide.
Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries' relations.
Officials from both nations say 0 the U.S. public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled * for next week in Washington.
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions; indeed, each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S. .
Where they disagree *T*-1 is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan.
The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives *T*-183 as barriers to investment; Japan denies 0 there are real barriers.
The heated talk stirred *-1 up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate, even though it's only one of many subjects 0 *T*-2 to be covered *-116 in the bilateral talks, known * as the Structural Impediments Initiative.
The Japanese "should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy," says 0 *T*-1 Charles Dallara, U.S. assistant Treasury secretary, who *T*-184 has been in Tokyo this week *PRO*-2 informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders.
"We have a long history of *PRO* maintaining an open direct - investment policy," Mr. Dallara says *T*-1.
"U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment" in Japan.
The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public's rancor.
One clear sign of Japan's nervousness came this week, when a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular, half - hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. *T*-1.
"We believe that it *EXP*-3 is vitally important for those Japanese business interests {in the U.S. .} to be more aware of the emotions and concerns of the American people," said *T*-1 the spokesman, Taizo Watanabe.
At the same time, though, he chastised the media for *PRO* paying such close attention to Japanese investment when other foreign countries, notably Britain, are acquiring more American assets *T*-1.
Fears that Japanese investors are buying up America have escalated sharply in the past several weeks, with Sony Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. from Coca - Cola Co. and Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s acquisition of a 51% holding in Rockefeller Group, the owner of some of midtown Manhattan's most exclusive real estate.
Even before those moves added fuel, the fires of discontent had been well stoked *-1 by the highly publicized experience in Japan of one U.S. investor, T. Boone Pickens Jr.
The Texas oilman has acquired a 26.2% stake valued * at more than $1.2 billion *U* in an automotive - lighting company, Koito Manufacturing Co.
But he has failed *-1 to gain any influence at the company.
Koito has refused *PRO*-1 to grant Mr. Pickens seats on its board, *PRO*-1 asserting 0 he is a greenmailer trying *PRO* to pressure Koito's other shareholders into *PRO* buying him out at a profit.
Mr. Pickens made considerable political hay with his troubles in Japan.
The Senate Finance Committee, chaired * by a fellow Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, last month urged U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills *PRO*-186 to use Mr. Pickens's experience in talks with Tokyo "*PRO* to highlight this problem facing Americans who *T*-185 seek access to the Japanese capital markets."
While Mr. Dallara and Japanese officials say 0 the question of investors' access to the U.S. and Japanese markets may get a disproportionate share of the public's attention, a number of other important economic issues will be on the table at next week's talks.
Among them are *T*-1 differences in savings and investment rates, corporate structures and management, and government spending.
Each side has a litany of recommendations for the other.
The U.S. says 0 it is anxious for results.
"We feel very strongly that we really need action across the full range of issues 0 we've identified *T*-1, and we need it by next spring," Mr. Dallara says *T*-2.
Both sides have agreed that the talks will be most successful if negotiators start by *PRO* focusing on the areas that *T*-186 can be most easily changed *-1.
But they haven't clarified what those might be *T*-187.
After the first set of meetings two months ago, some U.S. officials complained that Japan hadn't come up with specific changes 0 it was prepared *PRO*-1 to make *T*-2.
The Japanese retort that the first round was too early *PRO* to make concessions.
"*PRO* Just to say 0 the distribution system is wrong doesn't mean anything," says *T*-1 a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official.
"We need *-1 to clarify what exactly *T*-188 is wrong with it."
That process of *PRO* sorting out specifics is likely *-1 to take time, the Japanese say 0 *?*, no matter how badly the U.S. wants quick results *T*-3.
For instance, at the first meeting the two sides couldn't even agree on basic data used * in price discussions.
Since then, a team of about 15 MITI and U.S. Commerce Department officials have crossed the globe *PRO*-1 gauging consumer prices.
By Monday, they hope *PRO*-1 to have a sheaf of documents 0 both sides can trust *T*-2.
"Little by little, there is progress," says *T*-1 the MITI official.
"Both sides are taking action."

The Transportation Department, *PRO*-1 responding to pressure from safety advocates, took further steps 0 *PRO* to impose on light trucks and vans the safety requirements used * for automobiles *T*-2.
The department proposed *PRO* requiring stronger roofs for light trucks and minivans, *PRO* beginning with 1992 models.
It also issued a final rule requiring auto makers *PRO*-1 to equip light trucks and minivans with lap - shoulder belts for rear seats *PRO* beginning in the 1992 model year.
Such belts already are required *-89 for the vehicles' front seats.
"Today's action," Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said *?*, "represents another milestone in the ongoing program 0 *T*-2 to promote vehicle occupant safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards."
In September, the department had said 0 it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped *-90 with the same front - seat headrests that *T*-1 have long been required *-91 on passenger cars.
The Big Three auto makers said 0 the rule changes weren't surprising because Bush administration officials have long said 0 they planned *PRO*-1 to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans.
Safety advocates, including some members of Congress, have been urging the department for years *PRO*-2 to extend car - safety requirements to light trucks and vans, which now *T*-157 account for almost one - third of all vehicle sales in the U.S. .
They say that many vehicles classed * as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars.
They didn't have much luck during the Reagan administration.
"But now, there seems *-2 to be a fairly systematic effort *PRO* to address the problem," said *T*-1 Chuck Hurley, vice president of communications for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
"We're in a very different regulatory environment."
Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo .) praised the department's actions, *PRO*-1 noting that rollover crashes account for almost half of all light - truck deaths.
"We could prevent many of these fatalities with minimum roof - crush standards," he said *T*-1.
Sen. Danforth and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment *ICH*-1 in light trucks and minivans, including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved side - crash protection.
The department's roof - crush proposal would apply to vehicles weighing 10,000 pounds or less.
The roofs would be required *-1 *PRO*-2 to withstand a force of 1.5 times the unloaded weight of the vehicle.
During the test, the roof couldn't be depressed *-92 more than five inches.
In Detroit, a Chrysler Corp. official said 0 the company currently has no rear - seat lap and shoulder belts in its light trucks, but plans *PRO*-1 to begin *-2 phasing them in by the end of the 1990 model year.
He said 0 Chrysler fully expects *PRO*-1 to have them installed *-2 across its light - truck line by the Sept. 1, 1991, deadline.
Chrysler said 0 its trucks and vans already meet the roof - crush resistance standard for cars.
John Leinonen, executive engineer of Ford Motor Co.'s auto - safety office, said 0 Ford trucks have met car standards for roof - crush resistance since 1982.
Ford began *-1 installing the rear - seat belts in trucks with its F - series Crew Cab pickups in the 1989 model year.
The new Explorer sport - utility vehicle, set * for introduction next spring, will also have the rear - seat belts.
Mr. Leinonen said 0 he expects Ford to meet the deadline easily.
Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. posted a 62% rise in pretax profit to 5.276 billion yen ($36.9 million *U*) in its fiscal first half ended Sept. 30 compared with 3.253 billion yen a year earlier.
Net income more than tripled to 4.898 billion yen from 1.457 billion yen a year earlier.
When it's time for their biannual powwow *T*-1, the nation's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like Boca Raton and Hot Springs.
Not this year.
The National Association of Manufacturers settled on the Hoosier capital of Indianapolis for its fall board meeting.
And the city decided *PRO*-1 to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners.
The idea, of course: *PRO* to prove to 125 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the Rust Belt isn't so rusty after all, that it's a good place 0 for a company to expand *T*-1.
On the receiving end of the message were *T*-1 officials from giants like Du Pont and Maytag, along with lesser knowns like Trojan Steel and the Valley Queen Cheese Factory.
For starters, the executives joined Mayor William H. Hudnut III for an evening of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian Victor Borge.
Champagne and dessert followed.
The next morning, with a police escort, busloads of executives and their wives raced to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, *PRO*-1 unimpeded by traffic or red lights.
The governor couldn't make it, so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests.
A buffet breakfast was held *-1 in the museum, where food and drinks are banned *-2 to everyday visitors *T*-3.
Then, in the guests' honor, the speedway hauled out four drivers, crews and even the official Indianapolis 500 announcer for a 10 - lap exhibition race.
After the race, Fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers.
*PRO*-1 No dummies, the drivers pointed out 0 they still had space on their machines for another sponsor's name or two.
Back downtown, the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before *PRO*-1 boarding the buses again.
This time, it was for dinner and dancing--a block away.
Under the stars and moons of the renovated Indiana Roof ballroom, nine of the hottest chefs in town fed them Indiana duckling mousseline, lobster consomme, veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce.
*PRO*-2 Knowing a tasty--and free--meal when they eat one *T*-1, the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation.
More than a few CEOs say 0 the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings.
But for now, they're looking forward to their winter meeting--Boca in February.
*PRO* Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami's "A Wild Sheep Chase" (Kodansha, 320 pages, $18.95 *U*), baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common.
Although *PRO*-2 set *-1 in Japan, the novel's texture is almost entirely Western, especially American.
Characters drink Salty Dogs, whistle "Johnny B. Goode" and watch Bugs Bunny reruns.
They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo.
They worry about their careers, drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs.
This is Japan?
For an American reader, part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in *PRO* recognizing that Japan isn't the buttoned - down society of contemporary American lore.
It *EXP*-1's also refreshing *PRO* to read a Japanese author who *T*-52 clearly doesn't belong to the self - aggrandizing "we - Japanese" school of writers who *T*-53 perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese, unfathomable by outsiders.
If "A Wild Sheep Chase" carries an implicit message for international relations, it's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think 0 *?*.
That's not *PRO* to say that the nutty plot of "A Wild Sheep Chase" is rooted *-57 in reality.
It's imaginative and often funny.
A disaffected, hard - drinking, nearly - 30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister, erudite mobster with a Stanford degree.
He has in tow his prescient girlfriend, whose sassy retorts *T*-54 mark her as anything but a docile butterfly.
Along the way, he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who *T*-55 offers the hero God's phone number; and the Sheep Man, a sweet, roughhewn figure who *T*-56 wears--what else--a sheepskin.
The 40 - year - old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan.
A more recent novel, "Norwegian Wood" (every Japanese under 40 seems *-1 to be fluent in Beatles lyrics), has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987.
But he is just one of several youthful writers--Tokyo's brat pack--who *T*-57 are dominating the best - seller charts in Japan.
Their books are written *-1 in idiomatic, contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana.
In Robert Whiting's "You Gotta Have Wa" (Macmillan, 339 pages, $17.95 *U*), the Beatles give way to baseball, in the Nipponese version 0 we would be hard put *PRO*-2 to call *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a "game."
As Mr. Whiting describes it, Nipponese baseball is a "mirror of Japan's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony."
"Wa" is Japanese for "team spirit" and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it.
A player's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average.
Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara, a "humble, uncomplaining, obedient soul," as the male symbol of Japan.
But other than the fact that besuboru is played *-1 with a ball and a bat, it's unrecognizable: Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter; ties are permitted *-2--even welcomed *-2--since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives--players for the Tokyo Giants, for example, must always wear ties when on the road *T*-3.
"You Gotta Have Wa" is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers, rationed * to two per team, fare *T*-1 in Japan.
Despite the enormous sums of money 0 they're paid *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to stand up at a Japanese plate, a good number decide 0 it's not worth it and run for home.
"Funny Business" (Soho, 228 pages, $17.95 *U*) by Gary Katzenstein is anything but *?*.
It's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted *T*-58 for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo--to the regret of both parties.
In sometimes amusing, more often supercilious, even vicious passages, Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers' lives--at the regimented office, where employees are assigned *-59 lunch partners *T*-1--and at "home" in the austere company dormitory run * by a prying caretaker *T*-2.
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark.
It *EXP*-3's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity, that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager, and that Sony was chary of *PRO*-4 letting a young, short - term American employee take on any responsibility.
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein, who *T*-59 went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring *PRO*-1 to invent another Walkman.
But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein, after he committed the social crime of *PRO* making an appointment *PRO* to see the venerable Akio Morita, founder of Sony.
It *EXP*-1's a shame 0 their meeting never took place.
Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something, and it *EXP*-1's even possible 0 Mr. Morita would have *?* too.
Ms. Kirkpatrick, the Journal's deputy editorial features editor, worked in Tokyo for three years.
More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke.
In Singapore, a new law requires smokers *PRO*-1 to put out their cigarettes before *PRO* entering restaurants, department stores and sports centers or face a $250 *U* fine.
Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban, and smoking will be permitted *-60 in bars except during meal hours, an official said 0 *T*-1.
Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters, buses, public elevators, hospitals and fast - food restaurants.
In Malaysia, Siti Zaharah Sulaiman, a deputy minister in the prime minister's office, launched a "No - Smoking Week" at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools *PRO*-1 to ban on - campus smoking.
South Korea has different concerns.
In Seoul, officials began *-1 visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls *PRO*-1 to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes.
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places.
A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out *T*-1.
The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets, which *T*-60 include the U.S. and Japan.
The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified *T*-61 as materialistic values, compared with about one - third in Japan and the U.S. .
More than three in five said 0 they are under a great deal of stress most of the time, compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan.
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu's proposal *PRO* to build a $19 million *U* conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now.
The meeting, which *T*-62 is expected *-1 to draw 20,000 to Bangkok, was going *-2 to be held *-61 at the Central Plaza Hotel, but the government balked at the hotel's conditions for *PRO* undertaking necessary expansion.
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built *-62 in such a short time.
Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee *PRO*-2 asking him *PRO*-3 to back a Palestinian bid *PRO* to join the committee, the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said 0 *T*-1.
An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said 0 the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year.
The PLO in recent months has been trying *PRO*-1 to join international organizations but failed earlier this year *-1 to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization.
A Beijing food - shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese 0 *T*-2 to get AIDS through sex, the People's Daily said 0 *T*-1.
It said 0 the man, whom it did not name *T*-63, had been found *-1 to have the disease after hospital tests.
Once the disease was confirmed *-63, all the man's associates and family were tested *-64, but none have so far been found *-1 to have AIDS, the newspaper said 0 *T*-2.
The man had for a long time had "a chaotic sex life," including relations with foreign men, the newspaper said 0 *T*-1.
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150% and doubled gas prices.
The official news agency PAP said 0 the increases were intended *-1 to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices.
In happier news, South Korea, in *PRO*-1 establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday, announced $450 million *U* in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government.
In a victory for environmentalists, Hungary's parliament terminated a multibillion - dollar River Danube dam being built * by Austrian firms.
The Nagymaros dam was designed *-1 *PRO* to be twinned *-3 with another dam, now nearly complete, 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia.
In *PRO*-2 ending Hungary's part of the project, Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth *PRO*-65 to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, which *T*-64 still wants the dam to be built *-1.
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built *-67 as *PRO* planned *-2.
Czechoslovakia said in May 0 it could seek $2 billion *U* from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken *-68.
The Czech dam can't be operated *-69 solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project.
A painting by August Strindberg set a Scandinavian price record when it sold at auction in Stockholm for $2.44 million *U* *T*-1.
"Lighthouse II" was painted *-1 in oils by the playwright in 1901 ...
After years of decline, weddings in France showed a 2.2% upturn last year, with 6,000 more couples *ICH*-1 exchanging rings in 1988 than in the previous year, the national statistics office said 0 *T*-2.
But the number of weddings last year--271,124--was still well below the 400,000 registered * in 1972, the last year of increasing marriages.
Yields on money - market mutual funds continued *-1 to slide, amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates.
The average seven - day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked * by IBC's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45% from 8.47% for the week ended Tuesday.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year.
Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days, the longest since early August, according to Donoghue's.
Longer maturities are thought *-1 to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers *PRO*-2 to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period.
Shorter maturities are considered *-9 a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner.
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions, considered by some *PRO* to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely, reached a high point for the year--33 days.
Nevertheless, said *?* Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report, yields "may blip up again before they blip down" because of recent rises in short - term interest rates.
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold * at Monday's auction, for example, rose to 8.04% from 7.90%.
Despite recent declines in yields, investors continue *-1 to pour cash into money funds.
Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $1.5 billion *U* during the latest week, to $352.7 billion *U*.
Typically, money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates.
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9%.
Dreyfus World - Wide Dollar, the top - yielding fund, had a seven - day compound yield of 9.37% during the latest week, down from 9.45% a week earlier.
It invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees, which *T*-9 boosts its yield.
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12%, down from 8.14%.
The 30 - day simple yield fell to an average 8.19% from 8.22%; the 30 - day compound yield slid to an average 8.53% from 8.56%.
Investors took advantage of Tuesday's stock rally *PRO*-1 to book some profits yesterday, *PRO*-1 leaving stocks *PRO*-2 up fractionally.
Bond prices and the dollar both gained modestly.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished less than a point higher *PRO*-1 to close at 2645.90 in moderate trading.
But advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange were tidily ahead of declining stocks, 847 to 644.
Long - term bond prices rose despite prospects of a huge new supply of Treasury debt this month.
Continuing demand for dollars from Japanese investors boosted the U.S. currency.
Analysts were disappointed *-112 that the enthusiasm *ICH*-2 0 investors showed *T*-1 for stocks in the wake of Georgia - Pacific's $3.18 billion *U* bid for Great Northern Nekoosa evaporated so quickly.
The industrial average jumped more than 41 points Tuesday as speculators rushed *PRO*-1 to buy shares of potential takeover targets.
But with the end of the year in sight, money managers are eager *PRO*-1 to take profits and cut their risks of *PRO*-2 losing what for many *T*-178 have been exceptionally good returns in
Economic news had little effect on financial markets.
As *PRO* expected *-1, a national purchasing managers' report indicated 0 the nation's manufacturing sector continues *-2 to contract modestly.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions across the country, indicated that the overall economy remains in a pattern of sluggish growth.
In major market activity:
Stock prices rose fractionally in moderate trading.
Big Board volume totaled 154.2 million shares.
Bond prices were up.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond gained about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* of face amount.
The yield fell to 7.88%.
The dollar rose.
In late afternoon New York trading the currency was at 1.8500 marks and 143.80 yen compared with 1.8415 marks and 142.85 yen.
The Department of Health and Human Services plans *PRO*-1 to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal - tissue transplants.
Medical researchers believe 0 the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help *PRO* treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's.
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal - tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions.
James Mason, assistant secretary for health, said 0 the ban on federal funding of fetal - tissue transplant research "should be continued *-1 indefinitely."
He said 0 the ban won't stop privately funded tissue - transplant research or federally funded fetal - tissue research that *T*-111 doesn't involve transplants.
Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason's ruling, which *T*-112 will be issued *-1 soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health.
Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion, as does President Bush *?*, except in cases where a woman's life is threatened *-2 *T*-1.
The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health, aware of the policy implications of its research, asked for an HHS review of its plan *PRO* to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease *T*-1.
The department placed a moratorium on the research, *PRO* pending a review of scientific, legal and ethical issues.
A majority of an NIH - appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions, but the issue became embroiled *-2 in politics as anti-abortion groups continued *-3 to oppose federal funding.
The dispute has hampered the administration's efforts *PRO* to recruit prominent doctors 0 *T*-1 to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control.
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal - tissue transplants.
Antonio Novello, whom Mr. Bush nominated *T*-113 to serve as surgeon general, reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion.
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts.
Earlier this week, Dr. Sullivan tried *PRO*-1 to defuse these charges by *PRO*-4 stressing that candidates 0 *T*-2 to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged *-3 by "standards of scientific and administrative excellence," not politics.
But the administration's handling of the fetal - tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists.
"When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground *T*-1, there has *-3 to be a role *ICH*-4 for society *PRO* to make judgments about its applications," says *T*-2 Myron Genel, associate dean of the Yale Medical School.
"The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized *-1, so that no mechanism *ICH*-2 exists" for *PRO* finding a middle ground.
Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal - tissue transplants.
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason's ruling may discourage private funding.
"The unavailability of federal funds, and the climate in which the decision was made *-2 *T*-1, certainly don't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support," he said *T*-3.
Despite the flap over transplants, federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts.
"Such research may ultimately result in the ability *PRO* to regenerate damaged tissues or *PRO* to turn off genes that *T*-114 cause cancer" or *PRO* to regulate genes that *T*-115 cause Down's syndrome, the leading cause of mental retardation, according to an NIH summary.
The NIH currently spends about $8 million *U* *ICH*-2 annually on fetal - tissue research out of a total research budget of $8 billion *U*.
PAPERS:
Backe Group Inc. agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Atlantic Publications Inc., which *T*-141 has 30 community papers and annual sales of $7 million *U*.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Backe is a closely held media firm run * by former CBS Inc. President John Backe.
TV:
Price Communications Corp. completed the sale of four of its TV stations to NTG Inc. for $120 million *U* in cash and notes, *PRO*-1 retaining a 10% equity stake in the new concern.
NTG was formed *-1 by Osborn Communications Corp. and Desai Capital.
The Treasury said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to sell $30 billion *U* in notes and bonds next week, but said 0 the auctions will be postponed *-105 unless Congress acts quickly *PRO*-2 to lift the federal debt ceiling.
Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance, said 0 the Treasury may wait until late Monday or even early Tuesday *PRO*-2 to announce whether the autions are *-1 to be rescheduled *-106.
Unless it can raise money in financial markets, Mr. Basham said 0 *?*, the federal government won't have the cash 0 *PRO* to pay off $13.8 billion *U* in Treasury bills that *T*-176 mature on Thursday *T*-2.
Without congressional action, the Treasury can't sell any new securities--even savings bonds.
But despite partisan bickering over the debt ceiling, which *T*-177 has become entangled in the fight over *PRO* cutting capital - gains taxes, Congress is almost certain *-1 to act in time 0 *PRO* to avoid default *T*-3.
"Each day that Congress fails *-1 to act *T*-2...will cause additional disruption in our borrowing schedule, *PRO* possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the taxpayer," Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said *T*-3 in a speech prepared * for delivery last night to a group of bankers.
"*PRO* To avoid these costs, and a possible default, immediate action is imperative."
The securities 0 *T*-1 to be sold *-107 next week will raise about $10 billion *U* in cash and redeem $20 billion *U* in maturing notes.
The new securities, part of the federal government's regular quarterly refunding, will consist of:
-- $10 billion *U* of three - year notes, 0 *T*-1 to be auctioned *-108 Tuesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1992.
-- $10 billion *U* of 10 - year notes, 0 *T*-1 to be auctioned *-109 Wednesday and to mature Nov. 15, 1999.
-- $10 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds, 0 *T*-1 to be auctioned *-110 Thursday and to mature Aug. 15, 2019.
The Treasury also said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to sell $10 billion *U* in 36 - day cash management bills on Thursday.
They will mature Dec. 21.
None of the securities will be eligible for when - issued trading until Congress approves an increase in the debt ceiling, *PRO*-1 clearing the way for a formal offering, Mr. Basham said 0 *T*-2.
The Treasury said 0 it needs *-1 to raise $47.5 billion *U* in the current quarter in order *PRO*-1 to end December with a $20 billion *U* cash balance.
Auctions held * in October and those scheduled * for next week will raise a total of $25.6 billion *U*.
The remaining $21.9 billion *U* could be raised *-111 through the sale of short - term Treasury bills, two - year notes in November and five - year notes in early December, the Treasury said 0 *T*-1.
In the first three months of 1990, the Treasury estimates that it will have *-1 to raise between $45 billion and $50 billion *U*, *PRO* assuming that it decides *PRO*-2 to aim for a $10 billion *U* cash balance at the end of March.
The Life Insurance Co. of Georgia has officially opened an office in Taipei.
David Wu, the company's representative in Taiwan, said 0 Atlanta - based Life of Georgia will sell conventional life - insurance products.
Life of Georgia is part of the Nationale Nederlanden Group, based * in the Netherlands.
Michael Henderson, 51 - year - old group chief executive of this U.K. metals and industrial materials maker, will become chairman in May, *PRO*-1 succeeding Ian Butler, 64, who *T*-161 is retiring.
Mr. Butler will remain on the board as a nonexecutive director.
Newsweek, *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to keep pace with rival Time magazine, announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said 0 it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers.
The new ad plan from Newsweek, a unit of the Washington Post Co., is the second incentive plan 0 the magazine has offered advertisers *T*-1 in three years.
Plans that *T*-13 give advertisers discounts for *PRO* maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek, Time Warner Inc.'s Time magazine, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report.
Alan Spoon, recently named *PRO* *PRO*-1 Newsweek president, said 0 Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5% in January.
A full, four - color page in Newsweek will cost $100,980 *U*.
In mid-October, Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while *PRO*-1 not increasing ad page rates; with a lower circulation base, Time's ad rate *ICH*-2 will be effectively 7.5% higher per subscriber; a full page in Time costs about $120,000 *U*.
U.S. News has yet *-1 to announce its 1990 ad rates.
Newsweek said 0 it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan, which *T*-1 awards space credits *ICH*-2 to advertisers on "renewal advertising."
The magazine will reward with "page bonuses" advertisers who in 1990 *T*-1 meet or exceed their 1989 spending, as long as they spent $325,000 *U* in 1989 and $340,000 *U* in 1990.
Mr. Spoon said 0 the plan is not an attempt *PRO* to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989; Newsweek's ad pages totaled 1,620, a drop of 3.2% from last year, according to Publishers Information Bureau.
"What *T*-14 matters is what advertisers are paying *T*-15 per page, and in that department we are doing fine this fall," said *T*-1 Mr. Spoon.
Both Newsweek and U.S. News have been gaining circulation in recent years without heavy use of electronic giveaways to subscribers, such as telephones or watches.
However, none of the big three weeklies recorded circulation gains recently.
According to Audit Bureau of Circulations, Time, the largest newsweekly, had average circulation of 4,393,237, a decrease of 7.3%.
Newsweek's circulation for the first six months of 1989 was 3,288,453, *PRO*-1 flat from the same period last year.
U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%.
Argentina said 0 it will ask creditor banks *PRO*-1 to halve its foreign debt of $64 billion *U*--the third - highest in the developing world.
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed *-1 to be the first time 0 such an action has been called for *-3 by an Argentine official of such stature *T*-2.
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year.
"Argentina aspires *PRO*-2 to reach a reduction of 50% in the value of its external debt," Mr. Rapanelli said *T*-1 through his spokesman, Miguel Alurralde.
Mr. Rapanelli met in August with U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford.
Argentine negotiator Carlos Carballo was in Washington and New York this week *PRO*-1 to meet with banks.
Mr. Rapanelli recently has said 0 the government of President Carlos Menem, who *T*-29 took office July 8, feels 0 a significant reduction of principal and interest is the only way 0 the debt problem may be solved *-31 *T*-1.
But he has not said before that the country wants half the debt forgiven *-2.
When Warren Winiarski, proprietor of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley, announced a $75 *U* price tag for his 1985 Cask 23 Cabernet this fall *T*-1, few wine shops and restaurants around the country balked.
"This is the peak of my wine - making experience," Mr. Winiarski declared *?* when he introduced the wine at a dinner in New York *T*-2, "and I wanted *PRO*-3 to single it out as such."
It is in my estimation the best wine 0 Stag's Leap has produced *T*-2, and with fewer than 700 cases available, it is sure *-3 to sell quickly.
The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon, but it is not the highest.
Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $100 *U* a bottle.
One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums--wines limited * in production, of exceptional quality (or so perceived *, at any rate), and with exceedingly high prices.
For years, this group included a stable of classics--Bordeaux first growths (Lafite - Rothschild, Latour, Haut - Brion, Petrus), Grand Cru Burgundies (Romanee - Conti and La Tache) deluxe Champagnes (Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal), rarefied sweet wines (Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany, and Biondi - Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany).
These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $40 *U* *RNR*-1 to $125 *U* *RNR*-1 a bottle.
In the last year or so, however, this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members.
The classics have zoomed in price *PRO*-1 to meet the competition, and it almost seems that there's a race *ICH*-2 on *PRO* to come up with the priciest single bottle, among current releases from every major wine region on the globe.
France can boast the lion's share of high - priced bottles.
Bordeaux's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $60 to $80 *U* each (except for the smallest in terms of production, Chateau Petrus, which *T*-162 costs around $250 *U*!).
These prices seem *-1 rather modest, however, in light of other French wines from current vintages.
Chateau Yquem, the leading Sauternes, now goes for well over $100 *U* a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $179 *U*.
In Champagne, some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $100 *U* a bottle.
The first Champagne 0 *T*-1 to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs.
The '82 Salon is $115 *U*.
Roederer Cristal at $90 *U* a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level.
The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well.
E. Guigal's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne, for example, is $120 *U*.
None of France's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy, however.
The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee - Conti, 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world, have commanded three - digit price tags for several years now.
With the 1985 vintage, they soared higher: La Tache, $195 *U*; Richebourg, $180 *U*; Romanee - Conti, $225 *U*.
Another small Burgundy estate, Coche - Dury, has just offered its 1987 Corton - Charlemagne for $155 *U*.
From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $125 *U* a bottle, Piero Antinori's La Solaia, a $90 *U* Cabernet from Tuscany, and Biondi - Santi Brunello at $98 *U*.
Spain's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 (released * only in its 10th year) is $70 *U*, as is *?* Australia's Grange Hermitage 1982.
"There are certain cult wines that *T*-163 can command these higher prices," says *T*-1 Larry Shapiro of Marty's, one of the largest wine shops in Dallas.
"What *T*-164's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out.
We're seeing it partly because older vintages are growing more scarce."
Wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines, Mr. Shapiro continued: 0 *?* "We've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the '40s and '50s, which *T*-165 go for $300 to $400 *U* a bottle.
Some of the newer wines, even at $90 to $100 *U* *ICH*-1 a bottle or so, almost offer a bargain."
*PRO* Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek.
It's made *-2 only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly *T*-1 (the last was 1979) and comes from a single acre of grapes that *T*-166 yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987.
Owner Al Brownstein originally planned *PRO*-1 to sell it for $60 *U* a bottle, but when a retailer in Southern California asked, "Is that wholesale or retail?" *T*-2 he re-thought the matter.
*PRO*-1 Offering the wine at roughly $65 *U* a bottle wholesale ($100 *U* retail), he sent merchants around the country a form asking them *PRO*-2 to check one of three answers: 1) no, the wine is too high (2 responses); 2) yes, it's high but I'll take it (2 responses); 3) I'll take all 0 I can get *T*-3 (58 responses).
The wine was shipped *-97 in six - bottle cases instead of the usual 12, but even at that it was spread *-1 *PRO*-2 thin, *PRO*-1 going to 62 retailers in 28 states.
"We thought 0 it was awfully expensive," said *?* Sterling Pratt, wine director at Schaefer's in Skokie, Ill., one of the top stores in suburban Chicago, "but there are people out there with very different opinions of value.
We got our two six - packs--and they're gone."
Mr. Pratt remarked that he thinks 0 steeper prices have come about because producers don't like *PRO*-1 to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on.
Even if there is consumer resistance at first, a wine that *T*-167 wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move.
"There may be sticker - shock reaction initially," said *?* Mr. Pratt, "but as the wine is talked about *-1 and starts *-1 to sell, they eventually get excited and decide 0 it's worth the astronomical price *PRO*-3 to add it to their collection."
"It's just sort of a one - upsmanship thing with some people," added *T*-1 Larry Shapiro.
"They like *PRO*-1 to talk about *PRO*-2 having the new Red Rock Terrace {one of Diamond Creek's Cabernets} or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet, or the Petrus.
Producers have seen this market opening up and they're now creating wines that *T*-168 appeal to these people."
That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly *T*-1.
But consumers who *T*-169 buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were *?* a few years ago.
"They won't buy if the quality is not there," said *T*-1 Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans.
"Or if they feel 0 the wine is overpriced *-99 and 0 they can get something equally good for less."
Mr. Martin has increased prices on some wines (like Grgich Hills Chardonnay, now $32 *U*) just *PRO*-1 to slow down movement, but he is beginning *-2 to see some resistance to high - priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $30 to $40 *U* range.
Image has, of course, a great deal 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with what *T*-170 sells and what *T*-171 doesn't *?*, and it can't be forced *-100.
Wine merchants can't keep Roederer Cristal *PRO*-3 in stock, but they have *-1 to push Salon le Mesnil, *PRO*-2 even lowering the price from $115 *U* to $90 *U*.
It's hardly a question of quality--the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine, but, as Mr. Pratt noted 0 *T*-1, people have their own ideas about value.
It *EXP*-1's interesting *PRO* to find that a lot of the expensive wines aren't always walking out the door.
In every major market in the U.S., for instance, you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg, virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux (except Petrus), as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and, at the moment, the Stag's Leap 1985 Cask 23.
With the biggest wine - buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach, it *EXP*-1 will be interesting *PRO* to see how the superpremiums fare *T*-2.
By January it *EXP*-1 should be fairly clear what *T*-2's hot--and what *T*-172's not *?*.

As an actor, Charles Lane isn't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin's spirit.
Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that.
But it is Mr. Lane, as movie director, producer and writer, who *T*-65 has been obsessed with *PRO* refitting Chaplin's Little Tramp in a contemporary way.
In 1976, as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York, Mr. Lane shot "A Place in Time," a 36 - minute black - and - white film about a sketch artist, a man of the streets.
Now, 13 years later, Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full - length movie called *PRO* *PRO*-1 "Sidewalk Stories," a poignant piece of work about a modern - day tramp.
Of course, if the film contained dialogue, Mr. Lane's Artist would be called *-71 *PRO*-72 a homeless person.
So would *?* *T*-1 the Little Tramp, for that matter.
I say "*PRO* contained dialogue" because "Sidewalk Stories" isn't really silent at all.
Composer Marc Marder, a college friend of Mr. Lane's who *T*-66 earns his living *PRO*-1 playing the double bass in classical music ensembles, has prepared an exciting, eclectic score that *T*-67 tells you what the characters are thinking *T*-2 and feeling *T*-2 far more precisely than intertitles, or even words, would *?*.
Much of Mr. Lane's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets (though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin's notion of the Tramp as the good - hearted free spirit).
*PRO*-2 Filmed *-1 in lovely black and white by Bill Dill, the New York streets of "Sidewalk Stories" seem *-2 benign.
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose, *PRO*-2 noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs *T*-1.
The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village, on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated * by jugglers, magicians and other good - natured hustlers.
(This *ICH*-1 clearly is not real life: no crack dealers, no dead - eyed men selling four - year - old copies of Cosmopolitan, no one curled up in a cardboard box.)
The Artist has his routine.
He spends his days *PRO*-1 sketching passers - by, or *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to *?*.
At night he returns to the condemned building 0 he calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 home.
His life, including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist, seems *-1 carefree.
He is his own man.
Then, just as the Tramp is given *-72 a blind girl 0 *PRO* to cure *T*-2 in "City Lights," the Artist is put *-73 in charge of *PRO*-73 returning a two - year - old waif (Nicole Alysia), whose father *T*-1 has been murdered *-74 by thugs, to her mother.
This cute child turns out *-1 to be a blessing and a curse.
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose, but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life.
The beds at the Bowery Mission seem *-3 far drearier when he has *-1 to tuck a little girl into one of them at night *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 To further load the stakes, Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist, with a young woman who *T*-68 owns her own children's shop and who *T*-69 lives in an expensive high - rise apartment building.
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does *?* behind it.
Mr. Lane's final purpose isn't *PRO* to glamorize the Artist's vagabond existence.
He has a point 0 he wants *PRO*-1 to make *T*-2, and he makes it, with a great deal of force.
The movie ends with sound, the sound of street people talking, and there isn't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough, beaten voices.
The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "Story of Women."
He has made a harsh, brilliant picture--one that *T*-70's captivating--about a character who, *PRO*-2 viewed *-3 from the most sympathetic angle, *T*-1 would seem *-2 disagreeable.
Yet this woman, Marie - Louise Giraud, carries historical significance, both as one of the last women 0 *T*-1 to be executed *-2 in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government's hypocrisy.
While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews, its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor.
Marie - Louise, a small - time abortionist, was their woman.
She became an abortionist accidentally, and continued because it enabled her *PRO*-1 to buy jam, cocoa and other war - rationed goodies.
She was untrained and, in one botched job killed a client.
Her remorse was shallow and brief.
Although she was kind and playful to her children, she was dreadful to her war - damaged husband; she openly brought her lover into their home.
As *PRO* presented *-1 by Mr. Chabrol, and played *-1 with thin - lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert, Marie - Louise (called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Marie Latour in the film) was not a nice person.
But she didn't deserve *PRO*-1 to have her head chopped *-2 off.
There is very little 0 *T*-1 to recommend "Old Gringo," a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution.
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking *PRO*-1 to celebrate victory.
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot, and this one has Gregory Peck, in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who *T*-71 wants *PRO*-1 to die the way 0 he wants *PRO*-2 to die *T*-3.
Video Tip: Before *PRO*-1 seeing "Sidewalk Stories," *PRO* take a look at "City Lights," Chaplin's Tramp at his finest.
Boeing Co. said 0 it is discussing plans *ICH*-1 with three of its regular Japanese suppliers *PRO* to possibly help *PRO*-2 build a larger version of its popular 767 twin - jet.
The discussions are still in preliminary stages, and the specific details haven't been worked *-2 out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.
The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767, *PRO*-1 accounting for a combined 15% of the aircraft.
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20% and 25% *U* under the new program.
If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767, the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s.
Zenith Data Systems Corp., a subsidiary of Zenith Electronics Corp., received a $534 million *U* Navy contract for software and services of microcomputers over an 84 - month period.

3 . *PRO* Send your child to a university.
4 . *PRO* Buy a diamond necklace.
5 . *PRO* Make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an American savings - and - loan association through the Foster Corporate Parents Plan.
Americans today spend $15,000 *U* like pocket change--they don't think much about it.
But for an ailing savings - and - loan association--teetering on insolvency--it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise.
Your $15,000 *U* will help *PRO*-1 keep a needy savings and loan *PRO*-2 solvent--and out of the federal budget deficit.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you'll be helping a neighborhood S&L in areas crucial to its survival.
Like healthy regulatory capital.
A steady deposit base.
Performing loans.
At the same time, you'll give your Foster Savings Institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who *T*-206 want *PRO*-1 to close its doors--for good.
As a Foster Corporate Parent, you will experience the same joy felt * by Robert Bass, Lewis Ranieri, William Simon and others, who *T*-207 find ways 0 *PRO* to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves *T*-1.
That builds confidence, self sufficiency, not to mention critical regulatory net worth.
*PRO* Don't wait--a savings institution needs your help now!
Every day 0 you delay *T*-1, a savings institution's health--and the federal budget deficit--grows worse.
*PRO* Think about the good 0 you can do *T*-1 for just $15,000 *U* a month, about the cost of a mid-size Chevrolet or two semesters at a state university.
Then *PRO* send your support to a savings institution that *T*-208 has taken a bad rap in the press and on its bottom line.
Every $15,000 *U* 0 you send *T*-1 will go a long way *PRO* to boost sagging net worth and employee morale--and keep your Foster Savings Institution off the federal budget deficit!

INGERSOLL - RAND Co . (Woodcliff Lake, N.J .) --
William G. Kuhns, former chairman and chief executive officer of General Public Utilities Corp., was elected *-2 *PRO*-3 a director of this maker of industrial and construction equipment, *PRO* increasing board membership to 10.
Fujitsu Ltd.'s top executive took the unusual step of *PRO* publicly apologizing for his company's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects, while computer rival NEC Corp. made a written apology for *PRO* indulging in the same practice.
Meanwhile, business and government leaders rebuked the computer makers, and fretted about the broader statement 0 the companies' actions make *T*-1 about Japanese cutthroat pricing.
Fujitsu said 0 it bid the equivalent of less than a U.S. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years.
The company also disclosed that during that period it offered 10,000 yen, or about $70 *U*, for another contract.
But Fujitsu, Japan's No. 1 computer maker, isn't alone.
NEC, one of its largest domestic competitors, said 0 it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since 1987.
In both cases, NEC lost the contract to Fujitsu, which *T*-139 made the same bid and won a tie - breaking lottery.
All the contracts were for computer - system - design contracts and involved no hardware or software.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry summoned executives from the companies *PRO*-1 to "make sure 0 they understood" the concern about such practices, according to a government spokesman.
"These cases lead to the loss of the firms' social and international credibility," a ministry statement said *T*-1.
Japan's Fair Trade Commission has said 0 it is considering *PRO*-1 investigating the bids for possible antitrust - law violations.
"We would like *PRO*-2 to apologize for *PRO*-3 having caused huge trouble," Fujitsu President Takuma Yamamoto, read *T*-1 from a prepared statement as he stood before a packed news conference at his company's downtown headquarters.
The bids, he added 0 *?*, were "contrary to common sense."
NEC released a statement saying, "We feel sorry for *PRO*-1 having caused trouble to society," a form of apology common in Japan for companies caught * in embarrassing situations.
Japanese companies have long had a reputation for *PRO*-2 sacrificing short - term profits *PRO*-1 to make a sale that *T*-140 may have long - term benefits.
But the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted * as normal here--such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having extramarital affairs--are coming under close ethical scrutiny.
The fire is also fueled *-1 by growing international interest in Japanese behavior.
So far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue.
But in one of the auctions in question, International Business Machines Corp. made a bid substantially higher than the Fujitsu offer, according to the municipality.
The low - ball bids touch on issues central to the increasingly tense trade debate.
Foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in Japan, in part because Japanese companies unfairly undercut them.
The U.S. government in recent years has accused Japanese companies of *PRO* excessively slashing prices on semiconductors and supercomputers--products 0 Fujitsu and NEC make *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 whether the bidding flap would hurt U.S. - Japan relations, Mr. Yamamoto said, "this will be a minus factor."
The "one - yen" controversy first came to a head last week when the city of Hiroshima announced that Fujitsu won a contract *PRO* to design a computer system 0 *T*-2 to map its waterworks *T*-1.
The city had expected *-1 to pay about 11 million yen ($77,000 *U*), but Fujitsu essentially offered *PRO*-2 to do it for free.
Then Wednesday, Fujitsu said 0 it made a similar bid *PRO*-1 to win a library contract in Nagano prefecture two weeks earlier.
It also said that in July, it bid 10,000 yen *PRO*-2 to design a system for the Saitama prefectural library, and two years ago, it bid one yen *PRO*-1 to plan the telecommunications system for Wakayama prefecture.
The company said 0 it has offered *PRO*-1 to withdraw its bids in Hiroshima and Nagano.
The municipalities said 0 they haven't decided whether *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to force the company *PRO*-3 to go through with the contracts.
Fujitsu and NEC said 0 they were still investigating, and that knowledge of more such bids could emerge.
Mr. Yamamoto insisted that headquarters hadn't approved the bids, and that he didn't know about most of the cases until Wednesday.
Other major Japanese computer companies contacted * yesterday said 0 they have never made such bids.
"One yen is not ethical," Michio Sasaki, an official at Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, said *T*-1.
"Profit may be low, but at least costs should be covered *-1.
Consolidated Rail Corp. said 0 it would spend more than $30 million *U* on 1,000 enclosed railcars for *PRO* transporting autos.
The multilevel railcars, scheduled * for delivery in 1990, will be made *-1 by Thrall Manufacturing Co., a Chicago Heights, Ill., division of closely held Duchossois Industries Inc., Elmhurst, Ill.
This year, the railroad holding company acquired 850 such railcars.
Since chalk first touched slate, schoolchildren have wanted *PRO*-1 to know: What's *T*-2 on the test?
These days, students can often find the answer in test - coaching workbooks and worksheets 0 their teachers give them *T*-1 in the weeks prior to *PRO* taking standardized achievement tests.
The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders: "What is *T*-1 another name for the Roman numeral IX?"
It also asks them *PRO*-1 to add two - sevenths and three - sevenths.
Worksheets in a test - practice kit called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Learning Materials, sold * to schools across the country by Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co., contain the same questions.
In many other instances, there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials.
What *T*-102's more, the test and Learning Materials are both produced *-1 by the same company, Macmillan / McGraw - Hill, a joint venture of McGraw - Hill Inc. and Macmillan's parent, Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp.
Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common, some educators and researchers say 0 *T*-1.
Test - preparation booklets, software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry.
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say 0 they represent a form of school - sponsored cheating.
"If I took {these preparation booklets} into my classroom, I'd have a hard time *PRO*-1 justifying to my students and parents that it wasn't cheating," says *T*-2 John Kaminski, a Traverse City, Mich., teacher who *T*-103 has studied test coaching.
He and other critics say 0 such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests, which *T*-104 is *PRO* to gauge learning progress.
"It's as if France decided *PRO*-1 to give only French history questions to students in a European history class, and when everybody aces the test *T*-3, they say 0 their kids are good in European history," says *T*-2 John Cannell, an Albuquerque, N.M., psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization, Friends for Education, which *T*-105 has studied standardized testing.
Standardized achievement tests are given *-1 about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade.
The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan / McGraw's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, by Houghton Mifflin Co.; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test.
Sales figures of the test - prep materials aren't known *-1, but their reach into schools is significant.
In Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas, educators say 0 they are common classroom tools.
Macmillan / McGraw says 0 "well over 10 million" of its Scoring High test - preparation books have been sold *-1 since their introduction 10 years ago, with most sales in the last five years.
About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers' binders have also been sold *-1 in the past four years.
The materials in each set reach about 90 students.
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best - selling preparation tests.
Michael Kean, director of marketing for CTB Macmillan / McGraw, the Macmillan / McGraw division that *T*-106 publishes Learning Materials, says 0 it isn't aimed *-1 at *PRO* improving test scores.
He also asserted that exact questions weren't replicated *-1.
When *PRO* referred *-2 to the questions that *T*-107 matched *T*-1, he said 0 it was coincidental.
Mr. Kaminski, the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used *-2 in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test.
They devised a 69 - point scale--*PRO*-1 awarding one point for each subskill measured * on the CAT test--*PRO*-1 to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth - grade CAT.
Because many of these subskills--the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric measurement of volume, or pie and bar graphs, for example--are only a small part of the total fifth - grade curriculum, Mr. Kaminski says 0 *?*, the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many, if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures.
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills.
Scoring High matched on 64.5.
In CAT sections where students' knowledge of two - letter consonant sounds is tested *-1 *T*-2, the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does *?* *T*-4--to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know *T*-3.
Learning Materials for the fifth - grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items.
Rick Brownell, senior editor of Scoring High, says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring "the need 0 students have *T*-1 for *PRO* becoming familiar with tests and testing format."
He said 0 authors of Scoring High "scrupulously avoid" *PRO*-1 replicating exact questions, but he doesn't deny that some items are similar.
When Scoring High first came out in 1979 *T*-1, it was a publication of Random House.
McGraw - Hill was outraged.
In a 1985 advisory to educators, McGraw - Hill said 0 Scoring High shouldn't be used *-1 because it represented a "parallel form" of the CAT and CTBS tests.
But in 1988, McGraw - Hill purchased the Random House unit that *T*-108 publishes Scoring High, which *T*-109 later became part of Macmillan / McGraw.
Messrs. Brownell and Kean say 0 they are unaware of any efforts *ICH*-1 by McGraw - Hill *PRO* to modify or discontinue Scoring High.
Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. said 0 it has reached an agreement *ICH*-1 in principle *PRO* to buy buildings and related property in Albany, Ga., from Bridgestone / Firestone Inc.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The tire maker said 0 the buildings consist of 1.8 million square feet of office, manufacturing and warehousing space on 353 acres of land.
The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who *T*-123 fail *-1 to report detailed information about clients who *T*-124 pay them more than $10,000 *U* in cash.
The warnings, issued * to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week, have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar, who *T*-125 claim 0 the information is protected *-1 by attorney - client privilege.
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that *T*-1 requires anyone who *T*-126 receives more than $10,000 *U* in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions "in the course of trade or business" *PRO*-127 to report the payment on a document known * as Form 8300.
The form asks for such details as the client's name, Social Security number, passport number and details about the services provided * for the payment.
Failure *PRO* to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November, when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison *T*-1.
Attorneys have argued since 1985, when the law took effect *T*-1, that they cannot provide information about clients who *T*-127 don't wish their identities to be known *-3.
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years, *PRO*-1 citing attorney - client privilege.
Until last week, the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms.
"This form forces a lawyer *PRO*-2 to become, in effect, a witness against his client," said *T*-1 Neal R. Sonnett, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
"The IRS is asking lawyers *PRO*-1 to red - flag a criminal problem to the government," added Mr. Sonnett, a Miami lawyer who *T*-128 has heard from dozens of attorneys who *T*-129 received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer - generated IRS forms sent * by certified mail.
Mr. Sonnett said that clients who *T*-130 pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who *T*-131 don't have domestic bank accounts.
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers *T*-1.
Mr. Sonnett said 0 there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn't want the government to know 0 they had retained criminal defense lawyers *T*-1.
*PRO* Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients, he said 0 *T*-1.
The defense lawyers' group formed a task force *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 this week, chaired * by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt, 0 *T*-2 to deal with the matter.
The American Bar Association's House of Delegates passed a resolution *ICH*-1 in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement.
Michael Ross, a New York lawyer who *T*-132 heads the ABA's grand jury committee, said that lawyers are prohibited *-1 by the ABA's code of ethics from *PRO*-1 disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it *T*-3 or *PRO*-1 to prevent the client from *PRO*-4 committing a criminal act that *T*-2 could result in death.
Mr. Ross said 0 he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department, which *T*-133 would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers, *PRO*-1 to discuss the issue last May.
At that meeting, he said 0 *?*, the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures wouldn't be threatened *-2 against attorneys without further review and advance notice.
Mr. Ross said 0 IRS officials opposed the Justice Department's moderate stance on the matter.
But in the letters sent * in recent days, Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit, told attorneys that "*PRO* failing *-1 to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated *-2."
In some cases, the IRS asked for information dating back to forms 0 it received *T*-1 in 1985.
A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that "there has been correspondence mailed * about incomplete 8300s," but he declined *PRO*-1 to say why the letters were sent *-2 to lawyers now *T*-3.
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department's policy said that Justice officials hadn't any knowledge of the IRS's actions in the last week.
Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients, that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors.
Prosecutors need court permission *PRO*-1 to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business.
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information *PRO*-1 to help develop criminal cases.
Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters *PRO*-1 to test the issue.
In a number of recent cases, federal courts have refused *PRO*-1 to recognize attorneys' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential.
THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim.
Often, judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare, but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento, Calif.
On Tuesday, the judge called a news conference *PRO*-1 to say 0 he was quitting *PRO* effective Dec. 31 *PRO*-2 to join a San Francisco law firm.
The reason: the refusal *ICH*-1 of Congress *PRO* to give federal judges a raise.
"A couple of my law clerks were going *-1 to pass me in three or four years, and I was afraid 0 I was going *-2 to have *-3 to ask them for a loan," the judge quipped *T*-4 in an interview.
Federal judges make $89,500 *U* annually; in February, Congress rejected a bill that *T*-1 would have increased their pay by 50%.
Judge Ramirez, 44, said 0 it *EXP*-3 is unjust for judges to make what they do *?* *T*-2.
"Judges are not getting what they deserve *T*-1.
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants...and nobody blinks an eye.
When you become a federal judge *T*-1, all of a sudden you are relegated *-2 to a paltry sum."
At his new job, as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, he will make out much better.
The judge declined *PRO*-1 to discuss his salary in detail, but said: "I'm going *-2 to be a high - priced lawyer."
DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $11 million *U*, *PRO*-1 alleging 0 it mounted a "campaign *PRO* to harass and punish" him for *PRO* crossing a screenwriters' picket line.
The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc., a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner *T*-1.
Mr. Trudeau, a Writers Guild member, also was employed *-1 as a writer for Darkhorse, which *T*-134 was covered *-2 by a guild collective - bargaining agreement.
The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988.
In his lawsuit, Mr. Trudeau says 0 the strike illegally included Darkhorse, and the cartoonist refused *PRO*-1 to honor the strike against the company.
A spokesman for the guild said 0 the union's lawyers are reviewing the suit.
He said 0 disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined *PRO*-1 to comment on whether any are being held *-2 against Mr. Trudeau.
Mr. Trudeau's attorney, Norman K. Samnick, said 0 the harassment consists mainly of the guild's year - long threats of disciplinary action.
Mr. Samnick said 0 a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled *-1 next Monday in New York.
Mr. Samnick, who *T*-135 will go before the disciplinary panel, said 0 the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified.
In addition to the damages, the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from *PRO*-2 punishing *RNR*-1 or retaliating against *RNR*-1 Mr. Trudeau.
ABORTION RULING UPHELD *-1:
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family - planning programs that *T*-1 include abortion - related services.
A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted * in 1988 prohibits the use of so - called Title X funds for programs that *T*-136 assist a woman in *PRO*-1 obtaining an abortion, such as abortion counseling and referrals.
The rule also prohibits funding for activities that "*T*-137 encourage, promote or advocate abortion."
Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family - planning services, according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
The panel ruled that the restrictions don't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services don't violate the rights of pregnant women.
INQUIRY CLEARS TEXAS JUDGE of bias in comments on homosexual murder victims.
Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December, two weeks after *PRO*-1 sentencing an 18 - year - old defendant to 30 years in state prison for *PRO*-2 killing two homosexual men in a city park.
The judge was quoted *-1 as *PRO*-4 referring to the victims as "queers" and *PRO*-4 saying 0 they wouldn't have been killed *-2 "if they hadn't been cruising the streets *PRO*-3 picking up teenage boys."
But Robert R. Murray, a special master appointed * by the Texas Supreme Court, said 0 Judge Hampton didn't breach any judicial standards of fairness, although he did violate the state's judicial code by *PRO*-1 commenting publicly on a pending case.
*PRO*-1 Observing that the judge "has never exhibited any bias or prejudice," Mr. Murray concluded that he "would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute" as a victim.
Mr. Murray also said 0 Judge Hampton's comments didn't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice.
The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which *T*-138 is empowered *-1 *PRO*-139 to impose sanctions.
GAF TRIAL goes to round three.
Attorneys in the third stock - manipulation trial of GAF Corp. began opening arguments yesterday in the Manhattan courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe.
In an eight - count indictment, the government has charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., specialty chemical maker, and its Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin with *PRO*-2 attempting *PRO*-1 to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in November 1986.
The first two GAF trials ended in mistrials earlier this year.
This trial is expected *-1 to last five weeks.
*PRO* SWITCHING TO THE DEFENSE:
A former member of the prosecution team in the Iran / Contra affair joined the Chicago firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt.
Michael R. Bromwich, a member since January 1987 of the three - lawyer trial team in the prosecution of Oliver North, became a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the 520 - lawyer firm.
He will specialize in white - collar criminal defense work.
Mr. Bromwich, 35, also has served as deputy chief *RNR*-1 and chief *RNR*-1 of the narcotics unit for the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, based * in Manhattan.
It was Richard Nixon's first visit to China in 1972 that *T*-238 set in motion the historic rapprochement between Beijing and Washington.
But the former U.S. president's sixth visit to China, during which he spoke at length with Chinese leaders *T*-1, was nowhere near as successful at *PRO* easing strains that *T*-239 have recently afflicted the Sino - U.S. relationship.
Mr. Nixon, the most prominent American 0 *T*-1 to come to China since Beijing's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in June, harped on international outrage over the massacre.
The Chinese, in turn, took aim at American "interference" in China's domestic affairs.
One official newspaper, Legal Daily, even directly criticized Mr. Nixon, who *T*-240 is normally referred to *T*-1 here as an "old friend."
The paper accused him of *PRO*-3 being a leading proponent of "peaceful evolution," a catch phrase 0 *PRO* to describe what China believes 0 *T*-1 is the policy *ICH*-4 of Western countries *PRO* to seduce socialist nations into the capitalist sphere *T*-2.
The tension was evident on Wednesday evening during Mr. Nixon's final banquet toast, normally an opportunity for *PRO* reciting platitudes about eternal friendship.
Instead, Mr. Nixon reminded his host, Chinese President Yang Shangkun, that Americans haven't forgiven China's leaders for the military assault of June 3 - 4 that *T*-241 killed hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators.
"Many in the United States, including many friends of China, believe 0 the crackdown was excessive and unjustified," Mr. Nixon told Mr. Yang, who *T*-242 was directly involved *-2 in *PRO* ordering the attack *T*-1.
"The events of April through June damaged the respect and confidence which most Americans previously had *T*-1 for the leaders of China."
The Chinese responded in an equally undiplomatic fashion.
In talks with Mr. Nixon, Chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings, and even suggested that the U.S. was prominently involved *-1 in the demonstrations this spring.
In a meeting Tuesday, supreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, told Mr. Nixon, "*PRO* Frankly speaking, the U.S. was involved *-146 too deeply in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion which *T*-243 occurred in Beijing not long ago.
China was the real victim and it *EXP*-1 is unjust *PRO* to reprove China for it."
Despite the harsh exchanges, the U.S. and China still seem *-1 to be looking for a way 0 *PRO* to mend relations, which *T*-244 have deteriorated into what Mr. Nixon referred to *T*-2 as "the greatest crisis in Chinese - American relations" since his initial visit to China 17 years ago *T*-3.
In his return toast to Mr. Nixon, Mr. Yang said 0 the relationship had reached a "stalemate."
Relations between China and the U.S. have been tense since June 7, when Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing *T*-1.
Shortly afterwards, Mr. Bush imposed a series of anti-China sanctions, including suspension of most high - level talks, which *T*-1 could be codified *-147 in U.S. congressional legislation in the coming weeks.
Mr. Nixon is traveling in China as a private citizen, but he has made clear that he is an unofficial envoy for the Bush administration.
Mr. Nixon met Mr. Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, before *PRO*-1 coming to China on Saturday.
And he plans *PRO*-1 to brief the president at the end of the week, U.S. sources said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Nixon was *-1 to leave China today.
According to an American member of the Nixon party, the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his 20 hours of talks with top - level Chinese officials.
These included China's economic policies, human rights and the question of Mr. Fang.
Mr. Nixon also proposed that China restore its participation in the Fulbright Program, a U.S. government - funded academic exchange.
China pulled out of the program in July.
In his talks, the former president urged China's leaders *PRO*-1 to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the infusion of outside contacts and ideas.
"Ideas are going over borders, and there's no SDI ideological weapon that *T*-245 can shoot them down," he told a group of Americans *T*-1 at the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday.
There are no signs, however, of China's yielding on key issues.
But in one minor matter, Mr. Nixon appears *-1 to have gained a concession.
In a meeting with Premier Li Peng on Monday, Mr. Nixon said that he hoped 0 he wouldn't encounter guards with machine guns during his visit to the U.S. Embassy.
Sure enough, when he arrived at the embassy two days later *T*-1, the machine - gun - toting guards were gone--for the first time in five months.
A few blocks away, at the U.S. ambassador's residence, the guards encircling the compound also had discarded their Uzi - model arms for the first time since early June.
But the guards there retained their pistols, and a large contingent of plainclothes police remained nearby in unmarked cars.
Moreover, police and soldiers continue *-1 to harass Americans, who *T*-246 have filed several protests with the Foreign Ministry in the past week.
Several times, Chinese guards have pointed their automatic rifles at young children of U.S. diplomats and clicked the trigger.
The rifles weren't loaded *-1.
Oil production from Australia's Bass Strait fields will be raised *-34 by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field, the first of five small fields scheduled *PRO* to be brought *-35 into production before the end of 1990.
Esso Australia Ltd., a unit of New York - based Exxon Corp., and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture.
Esso said 0 the Whiting field started production Tuesday.
Output will be gradually increased *-1 until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day.
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels.
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels.
The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected *-3 to start *PRO*-1 producing early next year, and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year.
Esso said 0 the fields were developed *-36 after the Australian government decided in 1987 *PRO*-2 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax.
BRAMALEA Ltd. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to issue 100 million Canadian dollars (US$85.1 million *U*) of 10.5% senior debentures due Nov. 30, 1999, together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants.
The Toronto - based real estate concern said 0 each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$1,000 *U* principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase.
The warrants expire Nov. 30, 1990.
The issue will be swapped *-70 into fixed - rate U.S. dollars at a rate 0 the company said 0 *T*-1 is less than 9%; a spokesman declined *PRO*-2 to elaborate.
Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc., both Toronto - based investment dealers.
Bramalea said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to complete the issue by the end of the month.
Copperweld Corp., a specialty steelmaker, said 0 445 workers at a plant in Shelby, Ohio, began a strike after the United Steelworkers Local 3057 rejected a new contract on Tuesday.
The previous contract between Copperweld's Ohio Steel Tube division and the union expired at midnight Tuesday.
The union vote *PRO* to reject the proposed pact was 230 - 215.
Copperweld said 0 it doesn't expect a protracted strike.
It said 0 it has taken measures *PRO*-1 to continue shipments during the work stoppage.
Alleghany Corp. said 0 it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $150 million *U*.
The Sacramento - based S&L, which *T*-110 has 44 branch offices in north central California, had assets of $2.4 billion *U* at the end of September.
New York - based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern.
The purchase price includes two ancillary companies.
John R. Stevens, 49 years old, was named *-27 *PRO*-28 senior executive vice president and chief operating officer, both new positions.
He will continue *-1 to report to Donald Pardus, president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric - utility holding company.
Arthur A. Hatch, 59, was named *-28 *PRO*-29 executive vice president of the company.
He was previously president of the company's Eastern Edison Co. unit.
John D. Carney, 45, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 to succeed Mr. Hatch as president of Eastern Edison.
Previously he was vice president of Eastern Edison.
Robert P. Tassinari, 63, was named *-29 *PRO*-30 senior vice president of Eastern Utilities.
He was previously vice president.
The U.S., *PRO*-1 claiming some success in its trade diplomacy, removed South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries 0 it is closely watching *T*-2 for *PRO* allegedly failing *-3 to honor U.S. patents, copyrights and other intellectual - property rights.
However, five other countries--China, Thailand, India, Brazil and Mexico--will remain on that so - called priority watch list as a result of an interim review, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced 0 *T*-1.
Under the new U.S. trade law, those countries could face accelerated unfair - trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they don't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring.
Mrs. Hills said 0 many of the 25 countries that she placed *T*-1 under varying degrees of scrutiny have made "genuine progress" on this touchy issue.
She said 0 there is "growing realization *ICH*-1" around the world that denial of intellectual - property rights harms all trading nations, and particularly the "creativity and inventiveness of an {offending} country's own citizens."
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual - property rights could be hurting themselves by *PRO*-1 discouraging their own scientists and authors and by *PRO*-1 deterring U.S. high - technology firms from *PRO*-2 investing or marketing their best products there.
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for *PRO*-1 creating an intellectual - property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained *PRO* to pursue movie and book pirates.
Seoul also has instituted effective search - and - seizure procedures 0 *PRO* to aid these teams *T*-2, she said 0 *T*-1.
Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by *PRO*-2 initialing a bilateral copyright agreement, amending its trademark law and introducing legislation 0 *PRO* to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films *T*-1.
That measure could compel Taipei's growing number of small video - viewing parlors *PRO*-1 to pay movie producers for *PRO* showing their films.
Saudi Arabia, for its part, has vowed *PRO*-2 to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and *PRO*-2 to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works, Mrs. Hills said 0 *T*-1.
These three countries aren't completely off the hook, though.
They will remain on a lower - priority list that *T*-27 includes 17 other countries.
Those countries--including Japan, Italy, Canada, Greece and Spain--are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed *-1 to pose less - serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the "priority" list.
Gary Hoffman, a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual - property cases, said 0 the threat of U.S. retaliation, combined * with a growing recognition that *PRO* protecting intellectual property is in a country's own interest, prompted the improvements made * by South Korea, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.
"What this tells us *T*-28 is that U.S. trade law is working," he said *T*-1.
He said 0 Mexico could be one of the next countries 0 *T*-1 to be removed *-2 from the priority list because of its efforts *PRO* to craft a new patent law.
Mrs. Hills said that the U.S. is still concerned about "disturbing developments in Turkey and continuing slow progress in Malaysia."
She didn't elaborate, although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey.
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills *PRO*-1 to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30.
So far, Mrs. Hills hasn't deemed any cases bad enough *PRO*-1 to merit an accelerated investigation under the so - called special 301 provision of the act.
Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29.
Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group.
Norman Ricken, 52 years old and former president and chief operating officer of Toys "R" Us Inc., and Frederick Deane Jr., 63, chairman of Signet Banking Corp., were elected *-15 *PRO*-16 directors of this consumer electronics and appliances retailing chain.

In reference to your Oct. 9 page - one article "Barbara Bush Earns Even Higher Ratings Than the President," it *EXP*-1 is regrettable that you must continually define blacks by our negatives: "Among liberals, 60% have positive views of her, while 50% approve of the president's job performance.
In part, this may reflect the fact that ` she speaks a more progressive language' than her husband *?*, as Columbia's Prof . {Ethel} Klein puts it.
Among professionals, 76% have a favorable opinion of her, compared to 62% who *T*-248 approve of her husband's performance.
While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of his job, only 15% have a negative view of his spouse."
The statistics imply that three - quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush's job performance and 85% of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush.
If the assumption is that it *EXP*-1 is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful, the positive view is even more newsworthy.
Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious, stereotyped perspective.
Why are we blacks continually defined *-1 by our minority and the lowest common denominator *T*-2.

Program traders are fond of *PRO*-1 predicting that if they are blocked *-159 in the U.S., they will simply emigrate to foreign stock markets.
But in London and Tokyo, where computer - driven trading now plays a small but growing role *T*-1, traders say 0 a number of hurdles loom.
Government officials, especially in Japan, probably would resist any onslaught of program trading by players trying *PRO* to shrug off the U.S. furor over their activities and marching abroad with their business.
Japan is "very concerned" about the possible effects of program trading, a senior Japanese official said 0 *T*-1 after the Oct. 13 stock plunge in New York.
U.S. stock - index futures aren't even traded *-1 in Japan now.
And because of the time difference, the Japanese *RNR*-1 and the U.S. *RNR*-1 markets' trading hours don't overlap.
It all adds up to a barrier to American - style index arbitrage, the most popular form of U.S. program trading that *T*-253 seeks *PRO*-1 to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in New York and the price of a futures contract in Chicago based on those stocks.
About 11.6% of all program trading by New York Stock Exchange firms in September took place in foreign markets, according to Big Board data.
Yet it *EXP*-1 is difficult *PRO* to imagine Japan racing *PRO*-2 to introduce Chicago - style stock - index futures.
Japan's Finance Ministry already is scrutinizing institutional investors' activity *PRO*-1 to see whether policy changes are needed *-160 *PRO* to cope with the current level of program trading, said 0 *T*-2 Makato Utsumi, vice minister for international finance.
Program trading has taken off in Japan since last year's introduction of home - market stock - index futures trading on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges.
But regulators are wary.
They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec. 7, when the first bout of foreign - led index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last half - hour of trading *T*-1, *PRO* startling regulators who *T*-254 thought 0 they had written enough rules 0 *T*-2 to prevent such a swing.
Japan's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms 0 *PRO*-1 to limit how far futures prices could fall *T*-2 in a single session and *PRO*-1 to give market operators the authority *PRO* to suspend trading in futures at any time.
"Maybe it wasn't enough," a Finance Ministry official noted *T*-1 after the Dec. 7 surge.
Japan's regulators have since tightened controls on index - related stock purchases.
Tokyo's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses, though the Japanese are playing catch - up.
Some U.S. firms, notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage, both for customers and for their own accounts.
(Morgan Stanley last week joined a growing list of U.S. securities firms that *T*-255 have stopped *-1 doing index arbitrage for their own accounts.)
Both Deryck C. Maughan, who *T*-256 heads Salomon in Tokyo, and John S. Wadsworth, who *T*-257 heads Morgan Stanley there, ascribe a good part of their firms' success in Tokyo to their ability *PRO* to offer sophisticated, futures - related investment strategies to big institutional clients.
They don't have plans *PRO* to cut back.
"It has not been disruptive in the markets here," Mr. Maughan said *T*-1.
"The real difference seems *-1 to be that the cash market here...is big enough *RNR*-2 and liquid enough *RNR*-2 that the futures market isn't having the same impact 0 it does *?* *T*-3 in America."
The British also are scrutinizing program trades.
Index - arbitrage trading is "something 0 we want *PRO*-1 to watch *T*-3 closely," an official at London's Stock Exchange said 0 *T*-2.
"We don't think 0 there is cause for concern at the moment."
London serves increasingly as a conduit for program trading of U.S. stocks.
Market professionals said 0 London has several attractions.
First, the trading is done *-1 over the counter and isn't reported *-1 on either the U.S. or London stock trading tapes.
Second, it can be used *-1 *PRO* to unwind positions before U.S. trading begins, but at prices pegged * to the previous session's Big Board close.
In addition to the extra privacy of these trades, the transactions can often be less expensive *PRO* to execute, because the parties don't have *-1 to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist's fee.
Still, "Much less {index - arbitrage activity} *ICH*-1 is done *-161 over here than in the U.S." said 0 *T*-2 Richard Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life Assurance Co., which *T*-258 manages about #15 billion *U* ($23.72 billion *U*) in United Kingdom institutional funds.
Britain has two main index - arbitrage instruments.
A Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index option contract is traded *-162 on the London Stock Exchange's Traded Options Market.
And an FT - SE futures contract is traded *-1 on the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash.
The average number of FT - SE option contracts traded * on the London exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract's launch in 1984.
This year, the average of daily contracts traded * totaled 9,118, up from 4,645 a year earlier and from 917 in 1984.
But a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of index - options trading was only 15% of the size of the underlying equity market, exchange officials said 0 *T*-1.
This compares with estimates that the U.S. "derivatives" market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market.
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off, the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed *-1 to rise in September.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Management said 0 its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month.
Its index inched up to 47.6% in October from 46% in September.
Any reading below 50% suggests 0 the manufacturing sector is generally declining.
The purchasing managers, however, also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline.
Factories booked $236.74 billion *U* in orders *ICH*-1 in September, nearly the same as the $236.79 billion *U* in August, the Commerce Department said 0 *T*-2.
If not for a 59.6% surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors, factory orders would have fallen 2.1%.
In a separate report, the department said 0 construction spending ran at an annual rate of $415.6 billion *U*, not significantly different from the $415.8 billion *U* reported * for August.
Private construction spending was down, but government building activity was up.
The figures in both reports were adjusted *-1 *PRO* to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns, but weren't adjusted for inflation.
Kenneth Mayland, economist for Society Corp., a Cleveland bank, said 0 demand for exports of factory goods is beginning *-1 to taper off.
At the same time, the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed *-1 to revive the residential construction industry.
"What sector is *T*-46 stepping forward *PRO*-2 to pick up the slack?" he asked *T*-1.
"I draw a blank."
By most measures, the nation's industrial sector is now growing very slowly--if at all.
Factory payrolls fell in September.
So did *?* *T*-1 the Federal Reserve Board's industrial - production index.
Yet many economists aren't predicting that the economy is about *-1 to slip into recession.
They cite a lack of "imbalances" that *T*-47 provide early warning signals of a downturn.
Inventories are closely watched *-1 for such clues, for instance.
Economists say 0 a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that *T*-48 can lead to a recession.
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front: it said 0 factory inventories fell 0.1% in September, the first decline since February 1987.
"This conforms to the ` soft landing' scenario," said *T*-1 Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
"I don't see any signs that inventories are excessive."
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that *T*-49 eases inflation without *PRO*-1 leading to a recession.
The department said 0 orders for nondurable goods--those intended *PRO* to last fewer than three years--fell 0.3% in September to $109.73 billion *U* after *PRO*-1 climbing 0.9% the month before.
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2% to $127.03 billion *U* after *PRO*-1 rising 3.9% the month before.
The department previously estimated that durable - goods orders fell 0.1% in September.
Factory shipments fell 1.6% to $234.4 billion *U* after *PRO* rising 5.4% in August.
Shipments have been relatively level since January, the Commerce Department noted 0 *T*-1.
Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5% in September to $497.34 billion *U*, *PRO*-3 helped *-2 by strength in the defense capital goods sector.
Excluding these orders, backlogs declined 0.3%.
In its construction spending report, the Commerce Department said 0 residential construction, which *T*-50 accounts for nearly half of all construction spending, was off 0.9% *ICH*-3 in September to an annual rate of $191.9 billion *U*.
David Berson, economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted 0 the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single - family homes, but probably not until early next year.
Spending on private, nonresidential construction was off 2.6% to an annual rate of $99.1 billion *U* with no sector showing strength.
Government construction spending rose 4.3% to $88 billion *U*.
After *PRO*-1 adjusting for inflation, the Commerce Department said 0 construction spending didn't change in September.
For the first nine months of the year, total construction spending ran about 2% above last year's level.
The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued * earlier in the week by McGraw - Hill Inc.'s F.W. Dodge Group.
Dodge reported an 8% increase in construction contracts awarded * in September.
The goverment counts money as it is spent *-53; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded *-54 *T*-1.
The government includes money spent * on residential renovation; Dodge doesn't *?*.
Although the purchasing managers' index continues *-1 to indicate a slowing economy, it isn't signaling an imminent recession, said 0 *T*-2 Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., Stamford, Conn.
He said 0 the index would have *-1 to be in the low 40% range for several months *PRO*-1 to be considered *-55 a forecast of recession.
The report offered new evidence that the nation's export growth, though *PRO*-1 still continuing, may be slowing.
Only 19% of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October, down from 27% in September.
And 8% *ICH*-1 said 0 export orders were down last month, compared with 6% the month before.
The purhasing managers' report also added evidence that inflation is under control.
For the fifth consecutive month, purchasing managers said 0 prices for the goods 0 they purchased *T*-1 fell.
The decline was even steeper than in September.
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly *ICH*-1 in October than they had *?* for each of the five previous months.
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating.
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle *T*-1 and delivery times lengthen *T*-1, prices tend *-2 to rise.
The purchasing managers' report is based *-56 on data provided * by more than 250 purchasing executives.
Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening.
For the first time, the October survey polled members on imports.
It found that of the 73% who *T*-51 import, 10% *T*-1 said 0 they imported more in October and 12% *T*-1 said 0 they imported less than the previous month.
While *PRO*-1 acknowledging 0 one month's figures don't prove a trend, Mr. Bretz said, "It does lead you *PRO*-2 to suspect 0 imports are going down, or at least not increasing that much."
Items listed * as *PRO*-1 being in short supply numbered only about a dozen, but they included one newcomer: milk and milk powder.
"It's an odd thing 0 *PRO* to put *T*-1 on the list," Mr. Bretz noted *T*-2.
He said that for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.
They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk, coupled * with very low import quotas.

Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration.
Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued *T*-2 in fits and starts for decades.
But Japan's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions.
The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion "a process whereby these economies will be knitted *-1 together by the great Japanese investment machine *T*-2," says 0 *T*-3 Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp.
In the past five years, Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $5.57 billion *U*.
In Thailand, for example, the government's Board of Investment approved $705.6 million *U* of Japanese investment *ICH*-1 in 1988, 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year.
Japan's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade.
Asia's other cash - rich countries are following Japan's lead and pumping capital into the region.
In Taiwan and South Korea, rising wages are forcing manufacturers *PRO*-1 to seek other overseas sites for labor - intensive production.
These nations, known * as Asia's "little tigers," also are contributing to Southeast Asia's integration, but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan's.
For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia, the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth.
But Asian nations' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of *PRO* falling under Japanese economic hegemony now.
Because of budget constraints in Washington, the U.S. encourages Japan *PRO*-1 to share economic burdens in the region.
But it resists *PRO*-1 yielding political ground.
In the coming decade, analysts say 0 *?*, U.S. - Japanese relations will be tested *-1 as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region's economic behemoth.
Japan's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution.
In the past decade, Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export.
In the 1990s, *PRO*-2 spurred *-1 by rising labor costs and the strong yen, these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world.
*PRO*-1 To capture the investment, Southeast Asian nations will move *PRO*-1 to accommodate Japanese business.
These nations' internal decisions "will be made *-3 in a way 0 *PRO* not to offend their largest aid donor, largest private investor and largest lender *T*-1," says 0 *T*-2 Richard Drobnick, director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California's Graduate School of Business.
Japanese money will help *PRO*-1 turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region.
But, analysts say 0 *?*, Asian cooperation isn't likely *-1 to parallel the European Common Market approach.
Rather, Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors, says 0 *T*-1 Kent Calder, a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University.
In electronics, for example, a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan, assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia.
"The effect will be *PRO* to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone," says 0 *T*-1 Goldman Sachs's Mr. Hormats.
Countries in the region also are beginning *-1 to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties.
The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week *PRO*-1 to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications.
Participants will include the U.S., Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations--Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.
In addition, the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker, following up a proposal made * in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
The Baker proposal reasserts Washington's intention *PRO* to continue *-1 playing a leading political role in the region.
"In Asia, as in Europe, a new order is taking shape," Mr. Baker said 0 *T*-1.
"The U.S., with its regional friends, must play a crucial role in *PRO* designing its architecture."
But *PRO* maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region.
Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries (although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia).
Moreover, the Japanese government, now the world's largest aid donor, is pumping far more assistance *ICH*-2 into the region than the U.S. is *?*.
While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan's enlarged role in Asia, they also convey an undertone of caution.
"There's an understanding *ICH*-1 on the part of the U.S. that Japan has *-2 to expand its functions" in Asia, says 0 *T*-3 J. Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for trade.
"If they approach it with a benevolent, altruistic attitude, there will be a net gain for everyone."
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending *PRO*-1 to ease the U.S. security burden in the region.
The issue is further complicated *-1 by uncertainty over the future of the U.S.'s leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea.
Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence.
"No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home," Mr. Hormats says *T*-1.
For their part, Taiwan and South Korea are expected *-1 to step up their own investments in the next decade *PRO*-2 to try *PRO*-3 to slow the Japanese juggernaut.
"They don't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up," says *T*-1 Chong - sik Lee, professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania.

A form of asbestos once used * *PRO* to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed * to it more than 30 years ago, researchers reported 0 *T*-1.
The asbestos fiber, crocidolite, is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs, with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that *T*-1 show up decades later, researchers said 0 *T*-2.
Lorillard Inc., the unit of New York - based Loews Corp. that *T*-2 makes Kent cigarettes, stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956.
Although preliminary findings were reported *-2 more than a year ago, the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine, a forum likely *PRO* to bring new attention to the problem.
A Lorillard spokewoman said, "This is an old story.
We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties.
There is no asbestos in our products now."
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who *T*-3 studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes.
"We have no useful information on whether users are at risk," said *T*-1 James A. Talcott of Boston's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute.
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University.
The Lorillard spokeswoman said 0 asbestos was used *-1 in "very modest amounts" in *PRO* making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced *-1 with a different type of filter in 1956.
From 1953 to 1955, 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold *-3, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Among 33 men who *T*-4 worked closely with the substance, 28 *ICH*-1 have died--more than three times the expected number.
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases, including three with recently diagnosed cancer.
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than *PRO* expected *?*, the researchers said 0 *T*-1.
"The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who *T*-5 study asbestos - related diseases," said *T*-1 Dr. Talcott.
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton, Mass., paper factory appears *-1 to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied * in Western industrialized countries, he said 0 *T*-2.
The plant, which *T*-1 is owned *-4 by Hollingsworth & Vose Co., was under contract *ICH*-2 with Lorillard *PRO* to make the cigarette filters.
The finding probably will support those who *T*-6 argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos, chrysotile, found * in most schools and other buildings, Dr. Talcott said 0 *T*-1.
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that *T*-7 doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth, needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that *T*-1 are classified *-5 as amphobiles, according to Brooke T. Mossman, a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine.
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected *-1 by the body, Dr. Mossman explained 0 *T*-2.
In July, the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos.
By 1997, almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed *-6.
About 160 workers at a factory that *T*-8 made paper for the Kent filters were exposed *-7 to asbestos in the 1950s.
Areas of the factory *ICH*-2 were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used *-8 *T*-1.
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin, poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used * *PRO* to make filters.
Workers described "clouds of blue dust" that *T*-1 hung over parts of the factory, even though exhaust fans ventilated the area.
"There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases," said *T*-1 Darrell Phillips, vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose.
"But you have *-1 to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago.
It has no bearing on our work force today.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, the self - regulatory organization for the over - the - counter securities markets, disciplined a number of firms and individuals for alleged violations of industry rules.

Without *PRO*-1 admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings that they failed *-2 to return funds owed * to customers in connection with a limited - partnership offering.
*PRO*-2 Reached *-1 at his office, Mr. McFall, currently chairman, said, "An implication that we failed *-3 to return investor funds is inappropriate and inaccurate."
He described the situation as "an escrow problem, a timing issue," which he said 0 *T*-1 was rapidly rectified *-2, with no losses to customers.

"I wasn't ever actively engaged *-1 in any securities activities," said *T*-2 Mr. Cutrer.

Japan's reserves of gold, convertible foreign currencies, and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $1.82 billion *U* in October to $84.29 billion *U*, the Finance Ministry said 0 *T*-2.
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen - support intervention since June, when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level *T*-1.
The announcement follows a sharper $2.2 billion *U* decline in the country's foreign reserves in September to $86.12 billion *U*.

For 10 years, Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient.
*PRO*-4 A high - balance customer that banks pine for *T*-1, she didn't give much thought to the rates 0 she was receiving *T*-2, nor to the fees 0 she was paying *T*-3.
But in August, First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account, a package designed * *PRO*-1 to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill.
Among other things, it included checking, safe deposit box and credit card--all for free--plus a good deal on installment loans.
All 0 she had *-2 to do *T*-1 was put $15,000 *U* in a certificate of deposit, or qualify for a $10,000 *U* personal line of credit.
"I deserve something for my loyalty," she says *T*-1.
She took her business to First Atlanta.
So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days.
For nearly a decade, banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates 0 they pay *T*-1 on their deposits and charge *T*-1 on their loans.
The competitive rates were generally offset *-1 by hefty fees on various services.
But many banks are turning away from strict price competition.
Instead, they are trying *PRO*-1 to build customer loyalty by *PRO*-2 bundling their services into packages and targeting them to small segments of the population.
"You're dead in the water if you aren't segmenting the market," says *T*-1 Anne Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., a bank consulting firm in Atlanta.
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed * at young adults just starting careers.
The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $18,000 *U*, but throws in a special cash - flow statement 0 *T*-1 to help in *PRO* saving money.
In September, Union Planters Corp. of Memphis, Tenn., launched The Edge account, a package designed * for the "thirtysomething" crowd with services that *T*-197 include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees, and a full percentage point off on installment loans.
The theory: Such individuals, many with young children, are in their prime borrowing years--and, *PRO*-1 having borrowed from the bank, they may continue *-1 to use it for other services in later years.
For some time, banks have been aiming packages at the elderly, the demographic segment with the highest savings.
Those efforts are being stepped up *-1.
Judie MacDonald, vice president of retail sales at Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., says 0 the company now targets sub-segments within the market by *PRO*-1 tailoring its popular Seniors Partners Program to various life styles.
"Varying age, geography and life - style differences create numerous sub-markets," Ms. MacDonald says *T*-1.
She says 0 individual Barnett branches can add different benefits *ICH*-1 to their Seniors Partners package--such as athletic activities or travel clubs--*PRO*-2 to appeal to local market interests.
"An active 55 - year - old in Boca Raton may care more about Senior Olympic games, while a 75 - year - old in Panama City may care more about a seminar on health," she says *T*-1.
Banks have tried packaging before.
In 1973, Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account, which *T*-198 included free checking, a credit card, safe - deposit box and travelers checks for a $3 *U* monthly fee.
The concept begot a slew of copycats, but the banks stopped *-1 promoting the packages.
One big reason: thin margins.
Many banks, particularly smaller ones, were slow *PRO*-1 to computerize and couldn't target market niches that *T*-199 would have made the programs more profitable.
As banks' earnings were squeezed *-122 in the mid-1970s, the emphasis switched to *PRO* finding ways 0 *PRO* to cut costs *T*-1.
But now computers are enabling more banks *PRO*-1 to analyze their customers by age, income and geography.
They are better able *PRO*-1 to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that *T*-200 began in the late 1970s.
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay *T*-201 for deposits, as well as opened up the field for new products such as high - rate CDs.
Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account *T*-2, it began *-1 offering money - market accounts, certificates of deposit and interest - bearing checking, and staggering rates based on the size of deposits.
The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market - share battles into small towns across the nation.
"Today, a banker is worrying about local, regional and money - center {banks}, as well as thrifts and credit unions," says *T*-1 Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research.
"So people who *T*-202 weren't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling *PRO*-1 to define their customer base."
The competition has cultivated a much savvier consumer.
"The average household will spread 19 accounts over a dozen financial institutions," says *T*-1 Michael P. Sullivan, who *T*-203 runs his own bank consulting firm in Charlotte, N.C.
"This much fragmentation makes *PRO* attracting and keeping today's rate - sensitive customers costly."
Packages encourage loyalty by *PRO*-1 rewarding customers for *PRO* doing the bulk of their banking in one place.
For their troubles, the banks get a larger captive audience that *T*-204 is less likely *-1 to move at the drop of a rate.
The more accounts 0 customers have *T*-1, Mr. Sullivan says 0 *?*, the more likely they are *PRO*-3 to be attracted *-123 to a package--and *PRO*-3 to be loyal to the bank that *T*-205 offers it.
That can pay off down the road as customers, especially the younger ones, change from borrowers to savers / investors.
Packaging has some drawbacks.
The additional technology, personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive.
Chemical Bank spent more than $50 million *U* *PRO*-1 to introduce its ChemPlus line, several packages aimed * at different segments, in 1986, according to Thomas Jacob, senior vice president of marketing.
"It *EXP*-1's not easy *PRO* to roll out something that comprehensive, and make it pay," Mr. Jacob says *T*-2.
Still, bankers expect packaging to flourish, primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored *-124 to their needs.
"These days, banking customers walk in the door *PRO*-1 expecting you to have a package especially for them," Ms. Moore says *T*-2.
Some banks are already moving in that direction, according to Alvin T. Sale, marketing director at First Union Corp. in Charlotte.
First Union, he says 0 *?*, now has packages for seven customer groups.
Soon, it will split those into 30.
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Sale: "I think 0 more banks are starting *-2 to realize that we have *-3 to be more like the department store, not the boutique."

Your Oct. 6 article "Japan's Financial Firms Lure Science Graduates" states, "Industrial companies are accusing financial institutions of *PRO*-1 jeopardizing Japan's economy by *PRO*-2 raising the salary stakes for new employees."
The Japanese industrial companies should know better.
They are barking up the wrong tree, because it *EXP*-1 is basically their fault 0 they can't attract new employees.
Takuma Yamamoto, president of Fujitsu Ltd., believes "0 the ` money worship' among young people...caused the problem."
He is just passing the buck to young people.
What *T*-247's wrong with *PRO* asking for more money?
Money is not everything, but it is necessary, and business is not volunteer work.
It *EXP*-1 is not unethical *PRO* to choose a higher - salaried job.
Unfortunately, Japanese manufacturers have neither good working conditions nor good compensation packages.
I get the impression that some Japanese managers believe 0 *PRO* working harder for less money is beautiful.
I visited a lot of major Japanese manufacturers, but I never felt 0 I would want *PRO*-1 to be employed *-149 by any of them.
Many of them recently have been spending a lot of money on public relations and advertising *PRO*-1 to improve their images, but they should realize that the most important thing is real change, not *PRO* changing people's perceptions.
If the Japanese companies are seriously considering their survival, they could do at least three things *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 to improve the situation: raise salaries *PRO*-3 higher than those of financial institutions; improve working conditions (better offices and more vacations, for example); accept and hire more labor from outside Japan.

The dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday, *PRO*-1 buoyed *-2 by persistent Japanese demand for U.S. bond issues.
While market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish U.S. economic indicators, dealers note that Japanese demand has helped *PRO*-1 underpin the dollar against the yen and has kept the U.S. currency from *PRO*-2 plunging below key levels against the mark.
At the same time, dealers said 0 the U.S. unit has been locked *-1 into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks, in part because the hefty Japanese demand for dollars has been offset *-2 by the mark's strength, *PRO* resulting in a stalemate.
Jay Goldinger, with Capital Insight Inc., reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well--the mark climbed to 77.70 yen from 77.56 yen late Tuesday in New York--the strength of the U.S. bond market compared * to its foreign counterparts has helped *PRO*-1 lure investors to dollar - denominated bonds, rather than mark bonds.
"Dollar - yen {trade} is the driving force in the market," said *?* Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, "but I'm not convinced *-2 0 it will continue.
Who *T*-1 knows what *T*-2 will happen down the road, in three to six months, if foreign investment starts *-3 to erode?"
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8500 marks, up from 1.8415 marks late Tuesday, and at 143.80 yen, up from 142.85 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.5755 *U*, down from $1.5805 *U* late Tuesday.
In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 143.93 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 143.08 yen.
Douglas Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings.
He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp.'s announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified *-2.
He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group, as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia - Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence.
The forthcoming maturity in November of a 10 - year Japanese government yen - denominated bond issue valued * at about $16 billion *U* has prompted speculation *ICH*-2 in the market that investors redeeming the bonds will diversify into dollar - denominated instruments, according to Mr. Madison.
It *EXP*-1 remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled *-2 over.
Meanwhile, traders in Tokyo say that the prospect of lower U.S. interest rates has spurred dollar buying by Japanese institutions.
They point out that these institutions want *PRO*-1 to lock in returns on high - yield U.S. Treasury debt and suggest 0 demand for the U.S. unit will continue *PRO*-2 unabated until rates in the U.S. recede.
The market again showed little interest in further evidence of a slowing U.S. economy, and traders note that the market in recent weeks has taken its cues more from Wall Street than U.S. economic indicators.
Dealers said 0 the dollar merely drifted lower following the release Wednesday of the U.S. purchasing managers' report.
The managers' index, which *T*-147 measures the health of the manufacturing sector, stood at 47.6% *ICH*-1 in October, above September's 46%, and also above average forecasts for the index of 45.3%.
Some dealers said 0 the dollar was pressured *-1 slightly because a number of market participants had boosted their expectations in the past day and were looking for an index above 50, which *T*-148 indicates an expanding manufacturing economy.
But most said 0 the index had no more than a minimal effect on trade.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $374.20 *U* an ounce, down 50 cents.

SHAREDATA Inc. said 0 it will amend a registration statement filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission *PRO*-1 to delete a plan *PRO* to sell 500,000 newly issued common shares.
The Chandler, Ariz., company said 0 it will resubmit the registration 0 *T*-1 to cover only the 2.3 million warrants, each exercisable for the purchase of one common share.
Currently, ShareData has about 4.1 million common shares outstanding.
ShareData develops and markets low - cost software, peripheral equipment and accessories for computers.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to institute an additional "circuit breaker" aimed * at *PRO* stemming market slides.
Separately, John Phelan told a closed House subcommittee meeting in Washington that he would support Securities and Exchange Commission halts of program trading during market emergencies.
But the New York Stock Exchange chairman said 0 he doesn't support *PRO* reinstating a "collar" on program trading, *PRO*-1 arguing that firms could get around such a limit.
The Chicago Merc said 0 a new one - hour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor's 500 stock - index futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points--the equivalent of about a 150 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
If the 20 - point limit is triggered *-125 after 1:30 p.m . Chicago time, it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 3:15 p.m.
With the limit in effect, members would be able *PRO*-1 to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices, but not below it.
The exchange said 0 it decided 0 a new circuit breaker was needed *-126 following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock - index futures on Friday Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points *T*-1 and stock - index futures prices skidded as well *T*-1.
Late that afternoon the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract fell a total of 30 index points, *PRO*-1 hitting a Merc circuit breaker limit that *T*-210 remained in effect for the rest of the trading session.
The Merc said that its existing 30 - minute, 12 - point limit on S&P 500 stock - index futures trading (equal to about 100 points on the Dow Jones industrials), which *T*-1 was triggered *-127 Oct. 13, will remain in effect.
Leo Melamed, Merc executive committee chairman, said that the 12 - point limit appeared *-1 to lessen the selling panic Oct. 13.
But when the contract reopened *T*-1, the subsequent flood of sell orders that *T*-211 quickly knocked the contract down to the 30 - point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed *-128 *PRO*-128 to help keep stock and stock - index futures prices *PRO*-212 synchronized.
Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12 - point circuit - breaker aggravated the market slide Oct. 13 by *PRO*-1 directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
All of the changes require regulatory approval, which *T*-1 is expected *-129 shortly.
The exchange also said that the 30 - point circuit breaker, which *T*-212 currently provides only a one - hour respite during market sell - offs, will become the maximum one - day limit for the S&P 500 stock - index futures contract; the one - day limit now is 50 index points.
A final modification *ICH*-1 was made *-130 to the five - point opening limit for the contract.
The Merc said 0 that five - point limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading.
The limit lapses under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening 10 minutes of trading.
In Washington, House aides said 0 Mr. Phelan told congressmen that the collar, which *T*-213 banned program trades through the Big Board's computer when the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 50 points *T*-1, didn't work well.
He said that firms could get around the collar by *PRO* executing trades manually.
In a post-hearing news conference, Mr. Phelan, who *T*-214 has publicly expressed concern about market volatility, said 0 he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program - trading halt proposal "*PRO* providing 0 the SEC would be comfortable with the language" in a bill.
The program - trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is *?* on Wall Street, and several legislators want *PRO*-2 to grant the SEC the power *PRO* to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile *T*-3.
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said 0 he would be willing *PRO*-1 to consider circuit breakers that *T*-215 have preset trigger points, but he doesn't want discretionary power *PRO* to stop programs.
A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so "vague and mushy" that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could "come out *PRO*-2 feeling good *T*-1."
At one point, Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), by *PRO*-2 not going much beyond what *T*-1 already had been reported *-131 in the morning newspapers.
"Markey said 0 we could have done this in public" because so little sensitive information was disclosed *-132, the aide said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy *PRO*-1 just writing a report to the panel, the aide added 0 *T*-2.
At another point during the hearing, Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what *T*-1 would be discussed *-133 at a New York exchange board meeting today.
Mr. Phelan said 0 the Big Board is likely *-1 to study the program - trading issue.
That response annoyed Rep. Markey, House aides said 0 *T*-1, and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter.
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members *ICH*-2 attended the hearing, most notably Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, who *T*-216 has been willing *PRO*-1 to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months.
Mr. Dingell expressed concern, sources said 0 *?*, about jurisdictional problems in *PRO* regulating program trading, which *T*-217 uses futures *PRO*-1 to offset stock trades.
The futures industry is regulated *-134 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which *T*-218 reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses.

He had been a sales and marketing executive with Chrysler for 20 years.
Hudson General Corp.'s president and chief executive officer, Alan J. Stearn, resigned.
Mr. Stearn, 46 years old, couldn't be reached *-120 for comment.
A company spokesman declined *PRO*-1 to elaborate on the departure.

Faulding said 0 it owns 33% of Moleculon's voting stock and has an agreement *PRO* to acquire an additional 19%.

"The Cosby Show" may have single - handedly turned around ratings at NBC since its debut in 1984, and the Huxtable family still keeps millions of viewers laughing Thursday night on the network.
But some of the TV stations that *T*-149 bought "Cosby" reruns for record prices two years ago aren't laughing much these days.
The reruns have helped ratings at many of the 187 network affiliates and independent TV stations that *T*-150 air the shows.
But the ratings are considerably below expectations, and some stations say 0 they may not buy new episodes when their current contracts expire *T*-1.
Meanwhile, stations are fuming because, many of them say 0 *?*, the show's distributor, Viacom Inc., is giving an ultimatum: *PRO* Either sign new long - term commitments *PRO* to buy future episodes or risk *PRO*-2 losing "Cosby" to a competitor.
At the same time, Viacom is trying *PRO*-1 to persuade stations *PRO*-2 to make commitments to "A Different World," a spin - off of "Cosby" whose reruns *T*-151 will become available in 1991.
Viacom denies 0 it's using pressure tactics.
"We're willing *PRO*-2 to negotiate," says *T*-1 Dennis Gillespie, executive vice president of marketing.
"We're offering this plan now because we feel 0 it's the right time."
But, says 0 *?* the general manager of a network affiliate in the Midwest, "I think 0 if I tell them 0 I need more time, they'll take ` Cosby' across the street,"
Viacom's move comes as the syndication market is being flooded *-76 with situation comedies that *T*-152 are still running on the networks.
One station manager says 0 he believes 0 Viacom's move is a "pre-emptive strike" because the company is worried that "Cosby" ratings will continue *-1 to drop in syndication over the next few years.
"Cosby" is down a full ratings point in the week of Oct. 2 - 8 over the same week a year ago, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.
Mr. Gillespie at Viacom says 0 the ratings are rising.
And executives at stations in such major markets as Washington; Providence, R.I.; Cleveland; Raleigh, N.C.; Minneapolis, and Louisville, Ky., say 0 they may very well not renew "Cosby."
Dick Lobo, the general manager of WTVJ, the NBC - owned station in Miami, for example, says 0 the show has "been a major disappointment to us."
"At the prices 0 we were charged *-78 *T*-1, there should have been some return for the dollar.
There wasn't *?*."
Neil Kuvin, the general manager of WHAS, the CBS affiliate in Louisville, says 0 "Cosby" gets the station's highest ratings and 0 he's "pleased *-1."

No fewer than 24 country funds *ICH*-1 have been launched *-2 or registered *-2 with regulators this year, triple the level of all of 1988, according to Charles E. Simon & Co., a Washington - based research firm.
The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal.
Next week, the Philippine Fund's launch will be capped *-46 by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino--the first time 0 a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here *T*-1.
The next province?
"Anything's possible--how about the New Guinea Fund?" quips *T*-1 George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton, Mass.
The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the "closed - end fund mania" of the 1920s, Mr. Foot says 0 *?*, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular *T*-1.
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash.
Unlike traditional open - end mutual funds, most of these one - country portfolios are the "closed - end" type, *PRO*-1 issuing a fixed number of shares that *T*-38 trade publicly.
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that *T*-39 are *RNR*-1 or soon will be *RNR*-1 listed *-2 in New York or London.
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets.
"People are looking *PRO*-1 to stake their claims" now before the number of available nations runs out, says *T*-2 Michael Porter, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York.
Behind all the hoopla is *T*-1 some heavy - duty competition.
As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years, securities firms have scrambled *PRO*-1 to find new products that brokers find *T*-40 easy 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-2.
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide *PRO*-1 to do it.
Financial planners often urge investors *PRO*-1 to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities.
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets, such as the U.S. and Japan.
Country funds offer an easy way 0 *PRO* to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of *PRO* seeking out individual companies *T*-1.
But it doesn't take much *PRO* to get burned *-1.
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds.
Another concern: The funds' share prices tend *PRO*-1 to swing more than the broader market.
When the stock market dropped nearly 7% Oct. 13 *T*-1, for instance, the Mexico Fund plunged about 18% and the Spain Fund fell 16%.
And most country funds were clobbered *-47 more than most stocks after the 1987 crash.
What *ICH*-1 *T*-41's so wild about the funds' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios.
After *PRO*-1 trading at an average discount of more than 20% in late 1987 and part of last year, country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6%.
The reason: Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks 0 they hold *T*-1.
It's probably worth *PRO* paying a premium for funds that *T*-42 invest in markets that *T*-43 are partially closed to foreign investors, such as South Korea, some specialists say 0 *T*-1.
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120% premium.
It has been targeted *-48 by Japanese investors as a good long - term play tied * to 1992's European economic integration.
And several new funds that *T*-44 aren't even fully invested yet have jumped *PRO*-1 to trade at big premiums.
"I'm very alarmed *PRO*-2 to see these rich valuations," says *T*-1 Smith Barney's Mr. Porter.
The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds, Mr. Porter suggests 0 *T*-1.
Unlike many U.S. investors, those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign - stock exposure may be less resistant to *PRO* paying higher prices for country funds.
"There may be an international viewpoint cast * on the funds listed * here," Mr. Porter says *T*-1.
Nonetheless, plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds.
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these so - called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded * in the U.S. .
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without *PRO*-1 paying the premium.
For people who *T*-45 insist on *PRO*-5 jumping in now *PRO*-1 to buy the funds, Newgate's Mr. Foot says: "The only advice 0 I have *T*-2 for these folks is that those who *T*-3 come to the party late had better *-4 be ready *PRO*-4 to leave quickly.
Japanese investors nearly single - handedly bought up two new mortgage securities - based mutual funds totaling $701 million *U*, the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said 0 *T*-1.
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage - based instruments, Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, said 0 *T*-1 at a news conference.
He said 0 more than 90% of the funds were placed *-40 with Japanese institutional investors.
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong.
Earlier this year, Japanese investors snapped up a similar, $570 million *U* mortgage - backed securities mutual fund.
That fund was put *-41 together by Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank.
The latest two funds were assembled *-42 jointly by Goldman, Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co.
The new, seven - year funds--one offering a fixed - rate return and the other with a floating - rate return linked * to the London interbank offered rate--offer two key advantages to Japanese investors.
First, they are designed *-1 *PRO*-2 to eliminate the risk of prepayment--mortgage - backed securities can be retired *-43 early if interest rates decline, and such prepayment forces investors *PRO*-44 to redeploy their money at lower rates.
Second, they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments, *PRO*-1 reducing the administrative burden on investors.
By *PRO* addressing those problems, Mr. Maxwell said 0 *?*, the new funds have become "extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. ."
Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage - backed securities to more than 1% of the $900 billion *U* in such instruments outstanding, and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate.
They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae's corporate debt, *PRO*-2 buying $2.4 billion *U* in Fannie Mae bonds *ICH*-1 during the first nine months of the year, or almost a tenth of the total amount issued *.
The House voted *PRO*-1 to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981, *PRO*-1 casting a solid 382 - 37 vote for a compromise measure backed * by President Bush.
The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor.
Advocates said 0 the 90 - cent - an - hour rise, to $4.25 *U* an hour by April 1991, is too small for the working poor, while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs.
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to * on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress, after congressional Republicans urged the White House *PRO*-2 to bend a bit from its previous resistance *PRO* to compromise.
So both sides accepted the compromise, which *T*-259 would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four - year law was enacted *-163 in 1977, *PRO*-163 raising the wage to $3.35 *U* an hour from $2.65 *U*.
Under the measure passed * yesterday, the minimum wage would rise to $3.80 *U* next April.
The Senate plans *PRO*-1 to take up the measure quickly and is expected *-1 to pass it.
"There are no smiles about this bill," Rep. Pat Williams (D., Mont .) said *T*-1 during House floor debate yesterday.
But "because it's all 0 we've got *T*-1, I'm going *-2 to vote for it."
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged *-164 at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage, the level of $4.25 *U* an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35% of average factory pay, Mr. Williams said 0 *T*-1.
But Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J .) instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth "training" wage, a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought *T*-1 for many years.
*PRO* Adopting a training - wage policy means "*PRO* getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage," Mrs. Roukema said 0 *T*-1.
Policy makers regard the youth wage as *PRO* helping *PRO*-1 to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage, but they have lately touted it as necessary *PRO*-2 to help *PRO*-3 impart job skills to entrants into the work force.
Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea, but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence.
The compromise sets the training wage at $3.35 *U* an hour next April, and at $3.61 *U* an hour, or 85% of the minimum wage, in April 1991.
Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days, without restriction, to workers with less than six months of job experience *NOT*, and for another 90 days if the company uses a government - certified training program for the young workers.
The training wage covers only workers who *T*-260 are 16 to 19 years old.
The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six - month training wage that *T*-1 could be paid *-165 any time 0 a worker of any age took a new job *T*-2.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, *PRO*-1 still opposed to any mininum - wage increase, said 0 the compromise plan *PRO* to lift the wage floor 27% in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 "will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers.
Troubled NBI Inc. said 0 it fired more than half its work force and is discontinuing its hardware business *PRO*-1 to focus on its software and service operations.
The ailing company, which *T*-236 has reported net losses for 16 consecutive quarters, said 0 it won't manufacture network computer systems any more and will greatly reduce its costly direct sales force.
Altogether, NBI said 0 it will eliminate 266 jobs at its Boulder headquarters, 176 field sales jobs and 50 jobs at its Canadian and United Kingdom headquarters.
The company's work force will fall to about 400 people.
Stephen G. Jerritts, president and chief executive officer, said 0 customers weren't willing *PRO*-1 to commit to an expensive NBI hardware systems because of the company's financial troubles.
Further, he said 0 *?*, the company doesn't have the capital needed * *PRO* to build the business over the next year or two.
"We flat ran out of financing resources," Mr. Jerritts said *T*-1.
"We had *-1 to do something structurally and radically different."
As a result, he said 0 NBI will focus on *PRO* servicing its installed base of systems, trying *PRO*-4 to provide maintenance for other manufacturers and expanding its software business, *PRO*-4 using some of the applications 0 it developed *T*-3 for its hardware.
The company currently offers a word - processing package for personal computers called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Legend.
The company, which *T*-237 recently said 0 it lacked the profits and capital 0 *PRO* to pay dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock *T*-1, said 0 it has hired an investment banker 0 *T*-2 to help it raise additional cash.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NBI common closed at 93 cents a share, up 31 cents.
Structural Dynamics Research Corp., which *T*-143 makes computer - aided engineering software, said 0 it introduced new technology in mechanical design automation that *T*-144 will improve mechanical engineering productivity.
Investors unsettled * by the stock market's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks.
That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10%.
But *PRO* don't breathe too easy: Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices, some analysts warn 0 *T*-1.
In the past, they say 0 *?*, the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock - market party was almost over *T*-2.
That can be a trap for unwary investors, says 0 *T*-1 Richard Bernstein, senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.
Strong dividend growth, he says 0 *?*, is "the black widow of valuation"--a reference to the female spiders that *T*-231 attract males and then kill them after mating.
Stephen Boesel, president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund, explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time.
"Invariably, those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments," he says *T*-1.
"And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market."
Indeed, analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks *T*-1.
In 1976, for example, dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index soared 10%, following much slower growth the year before.
The S&P index started *-1 sliding in price in September 1976, and fell 12% in 1977--despite a 15% expansion in dividends that year.
That pattern hasn't always held, but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious.
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10% in 1988, according to Standard & Poor's Corp., and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9% and 14% *U*.
Many people believe 0 the growth in dividends will slow next year, although a minority see double - digit gains continuing.
Meanwhile, many market watchers say 0 recent dividend trends raise another warning flag: While dividends have risen smartly, their expansion hasn't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices.
As a result, the market's dividend yield--dividends as a percentage of price--has slid to a level that *T*-232 is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards.
*PRO* Put *-1 another way, the decline in the yield suggests 0 stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends 0 they pay *T*-2, some market analysts say 0 *T*-3.
They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500.
The figure is currently about 3.3%, up from 3.2% before the recent market slide.
Some analysts say 0 investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3%.
A drop below that 3% benchmark "has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued *-2," says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price.
In fact, "the market has always tanked.
Always.
There's never been an exception," says 0 *?* Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago investment adviser and money manager, based on a review of six decades of stock - market data.
The last time 0 the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3% *T*-1 was in the summer of 1987.
Stockholders who *T*-233 took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle.
There have been only seven other times--in 1929, 1933, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1972--when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3% for at least two consecutive months *T*-1, Mr. Perritt found 0 *T*-2.
And in each case, he says 0 *?*, a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year.
Still, some market analysts say 0 the current 3.3% reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been *?* in years past.
"It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner," says *T*-1 James H. Coxon, head of stock investments for Cigna Corp., the Philadelphia - based insurer.
In particular, Mr. Coxon says 0 *?*, businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow *ICH*-3 in the form of dividends than they have *?* historically.
So, while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends, they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength.
Rather than *PRO*-1 increasing dividends, some companies have used cash *PRO*-1 to buy back some of their shares, notes 0 *T*-2 Steven G. Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
He factors that into the market yield *PRO*-1 to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6%.
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so, he says 0 *T*-1.
What *T*-234 will happen to dividend growth next year?
Common wisdom suggests a single - digit rate of growth, reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits.
PaineWebber Inc., for instance, is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5% in 1990, down from an estimated 11% this year.
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns--the environment 0 the firm expects *T*-1 in 1990 *T*-2--the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4% to a decline of 1%, according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger.
The minority argument, meanwhile, is that businesses have the financial wherewithal *ICH*-2 this time around 0 *PRO* to declare sharply higher dividends *T*-1 even if their earnings weaken.
Dividend growth on the order of 12% is expected *-142 by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs.
Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of *PRO*-2 having plenty of cash left over * after *PRO*-1 paying dividends and making capital expenditures.
One indicator 0 investors might want *PRO*-2 to watch *T*-1 is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends.
A total of 139 companies *ICH*-1 raised dividends in October, basically unchanged from 138 a year ago, S&P said 0 *T*-2 Wednesday.
That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year - earlier pace *T*-1.
While the S&P tally doesn't measure the magnitude of dividend changes, a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year.
In any case, opinion *ICH*-2 is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get *T*-1 even if dividend growth continues at double - digit levels.
Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates 0 the stock market will deliver a 12% to 15% *U* total return from appreciation and dividends *ICH*-1 over the next 12 months--vs. a "cash rate of return" of perhaps 7% or 8% *U* if dividend growth is weak.
But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price, who *T*-235 also expects 12% growth in dividends next year, doesn't think 0 it will help the overall market all that much.
"*PRO* Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook, but I don't think 0 it's a main consideration," he says *T*-1.
With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year, "I wouldn't look for the market to have much upside from current levels.
Texas Instruments Japan Ltd., a unit of Texas Instruments Inc., said 0 it opened a plant *ICH*-3 in South Korea 0 *T*-2 to manufacture control devices.
The new plant, located * in Chinchon about 60 miles from Seoul, will help *PRO*-2 meet increasing and diversifying demand for control products in South Korea, the company said 0 *T*-1.
The plant will produce control devices used * in motor vehicles and household appliances.
In this era of frantic competition for ad dollars, a lot of revenue - desperate magazines are getting pretty cozy with advertisers--*PRO*-1 fawning over them in articles and offering pages of advertorial space.
So can a magazine survive by *PRO*-1 downright thumbing its nose at major advertisers?
Garbage magazine, billed * as "The Practical Journal for the Environment," is about *-1 to find out 0 *?*.
*PRO*-2 Founded *-1 by Brooklyn, N.Y., publishing entrepreneur Patricia Poore, Garbage made its debut this fall with the promise *PRO* to give consumers the straight scoop on the U.S. waste crisis.
The magazine combines how - to pieces on topics like backyard composting, explanatory essays on such things as what *T*-1 happens after you flush your toilet, and hard - hitting pieces on alleged environmental offenders.
Garbage editors have dumped considerable energy into a whirling rampage through supermarket aisles in a bid *PRO* to identify corporate America's good guys and bad boys.
In one feature, called *PRO* "*PRO*-2 In the Dumpster," editors point out a product 0 they deem *T*-1 to be a particularly bad offender.
From an advertising standpoint, the problem is 0 these offenders are likely *-1 to be some of the same folks that *T*-153 are major magazine advertisers these days.
With only two issues under its belt, Garbage has alienated some *PRO* would - be advertisers and raised the ire of others.
Campbell Soup, for one, is furious 0 its Souper Combo microwave product was chastised *-79 in the premiere "In the Dumpster" column.
The magazine's editors ran a giant diagram of the product with arrows pointing to the packaging's polystyrene foam, polyproplene and polyester film--all plastic items 0 they say 0 *T*-1 are non-biodegradable.
"It's precisely the kind of product that *T*-1's created the municipal landfill monster," the editors wrote *T*-2.
"I think that this magazine is not only called *-1 *PRO*-3 Garbage, but it is practicing journalistic garbage," fumes *T*-2 a spokesman for Campbell Soup.
He says 0 Campbell wasn't even contacted *-1 by the magazine for the opportunity *PRO* to comment.
Modifications *ICH*-3 had been made *-80 to the Souper Combo product at the time 0 the issue was printed *-81 *T*-1, he says 0 *?*, *PRO*-80 making it less an offender than *PRO* was portrayed *-4.
He admits, though, 0 it isn't one of Campbell Soup's better products in terms of recyclability.
Campbell Soup, not surprisingly, doesn't have any plans *PRO* to advertise in the magazine, according to its spokesman.
Some media experts question whether a young magazine can risk *PRO*-1 turning off Madison Avenue's big spenders.
"You really need the Campbell Soups of the world to be interested in your magazine if you're going *-1 to make a run of it," says *T*-2 Mike White, senior vice president and media director at DDB Needham, Chicago.
"The economics of magazine publishing pretty much require that you have a pretty solid base" of big - time ad spenders, he adds 0 *T*-1.
The first two issues featured ads from only a handful of big advertisers, including General Electric and Adolph Coors, but the majority were from companies like Waste Management Inc. and Bumkins International, firms that *T*-154 don't spend much money *PRO*-1 advertising and can't be relied on *-1 *PRO*-1 to support a magazine over the long haul.
A Waste Management spokeswoman says 0 its ad in the premiere issue was a one - time purchase, and 0 it doesn't have any plans *PRO* to advertise in future issues.
"We don't spend much on print advertising," she says *T*-1.
But Ms. Poore, the magazine's editor and publisher, contends 0 Garbage can survive, at least initially, on subscription revenues.
Individual copies of the magazine sell for $2.95 *U* and yearly subscriptions cost $21 *U*.
(It is, of course, printed *-1 on recycled paper.)
According to Ms. Poore, Old - House Journal Corp., her publishing company, printed and sold all 126,000 copies of the premiere issue.
The first and second issues sold out on newsstands, she says 0 *?*, and the magazine has orders for 93,000 subscriptions.
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 whether potential advertisers will be scared *-83 away by the magazine's direct policy, Ms. Poore replies: "I don't know and I don't care.
I'm not saying 0 advertising revenue isn't important," she says 0 *?*, "but I couldn't sleep at night" if the magazine bowed to a company because they once took out an ad.
Ad Notes....
INTERPUBLIC ON TV:
Interpublic Group said 0 its television programming operations--which it expanded *T*-1 earlier this year--agreed *PRO*-2 to supply more than 4,000 hours of original programming across Europe in 1990.
It said 0 the programs, largely game shows, will be provided *-84 by its E.C. Television unit along with Fremantle International, a producer and distributor of game shows of which it recently bought 49% *T*-1.
It said 0 that volume makes it the largest supplier of original TV programming in Europe.
Interpublic is providing the programming in return for advertising time, which it said 0 *T*-1 will be valued *-85 at more than $75 million *U* in 1990 and $150 million *U* in 1991.
It plans *PRO*-1 to sell the ad time to its clients at a discount.
NEW ACCOUNT:
CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, named Earle Palmer Brown & Spiro, Philadelphia, as agency of record for its $5 million *U* account.
The business had been handled *-86 by VanSant Dugdale, Baltimore.
AT&T FAX:
American Telephone & Telegraph's General Business Systems division, New York, awarded the ad account for its Fax product line to Ogilvy & Mather, New York, a WPP Group agency.
Billings *ICH*-3 weren't disclosed *-1 for the small account, which *T*-155 had been serviced *-2 at Young & Rubicam, New York.
FIRST CAMPAIGN:
Enterprise Rent - A - Car Inc. breaks its first national ad campaign this week.
The St. Louis firm specializes in replacement - car rentals, those provided * by insurance companies for cars damaged * in accidents.
*PRO*-2 Developed *-1 by Avrett, Free & Ginsberg, New York, the $6 million *U* campaign pitches Enterprise's consumer - driven service and its free pick - up and drop - off service.
LANDOR ASSOCIATES:
Young & Rubicam said 0 it completed its acquisition of Landor Associates, a San Francisco identity - management firm.
ACQUISITION:
Ketchum Communications, Pittsburgh, acquired Braun & Co., a Los Angeles investor - relations and marketing - communications firm.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Furukawa Co. of Japan said 0 it will acquire two construction machinery plants and a sales unit in France formerly belonging to Dresser Industries Inc. of the U.S. .
The company said 0 it made the purchase in order *PRO*-1 to locally produce hydraulically operated shovels.
Last October, the company also bought a wheel - loader manufacturing plant in Heidelberg, West Germany, from Dresser.
Furukawa said 0 the purchase of the French and German plants together will total about 40 billion yen ($280 million *U*).
James L. Pate, 54 - year - old executive vice president, was named *-44 *PRO*-45 a director of this oil concern, *PRO* expanding the board to 14 members.
The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $188 million *U* in pre-Communist Russian debts owed * to the U.S. government, the State Department said 0 *T*-2.
If the debts are repaid *-49, it could clear the way 0 for Soviet bonds to be sold *-50 in the U.S. *T*-1.
However, after two meetings with the Soviets, a State Department spokesman said that it *EXP*-1's "too early *PRO* to say" whether that will happen.
Coincident with the talks, the State Department said 0 it has permitted a Soviet bank *PRO*-1 to open a New York branch.
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved *-1 last spring and opened in July.
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled *-51 unless Moscow found a way 0 *PRO* to settle the $188 million *U* debt, which *T*-1 was lent *-52 to the country's short - lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 *T*-2.
Under a 1934 law, the Johnson Debt Default Act, as *PRO* amended *-1, it *EXP*-2's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government, unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization.
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value.
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to *PRO* satisfying the Johnson Act.
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to *PRO* raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II *PRO* lend - lease program.
The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt.
Until Congress acts, the government hasn't any authority *PRO* to issue new debt obligations of any kind, the Treasury said 0 *T*-1.
The government's borrowing authority dropped at midnight Tuesday to $2.80 trillion *U* from $2.87 trillion *U*.
Legislation 0 *T*-1 to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled *-11 in the fight over *PRO* cutting capital - gains taxes.
The House has voted *PRO*-1 to raise the ceiling to $3.1 trillion *U*, but the Senate isn't expected *-2 to act until next week at the earliest.
The Treasury said 0 the U.S. will default on Nov. 9 if Congress doesn't act by then.
The art of change - ringing is peculiar to the English, and, like most English peculiarities, unintelligible to the rest of the world.
-- Dorothy L. Sayers, "The Nine Tailors"
ASLACTON, England
-- Of all scenes that *T*-219 evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest *T*-2: An ancient stone church stands amid the fields, the sound of bells cascading from its tower, *PRO*-1 calling the faithful to evensong.
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop *PRO*-1 to chat at the church door, as members here always have *?*.
In the tower, five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached * to the same five bells that *T*-220 first sounded here in 1614.
But there is also a discordant, modern note in Aslacton, though it can't be heard *-135 by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening.
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells, St. Michael once had its own "band" of ringers, who *T*-221 would herald every Sunday morning and evening service.
Now, only one local ringer *ICH*-1 remains: 64 - year - old Derek Hammond.
The others here today live elsewhere.
They belong to a group of 15 ringers--including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training--who *T*-2 drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort *PRO* to keep the bells *PRO*-1 sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia.
"*PRO*-1 To ring for even one service at this tower, we have *-1 to scrape," says *T*-2 Mr. Hammond, a retired water - authority worker.
"We've tried *PRO*-1 to train the youngsters, but they have their discos and their dances, and they just drift away."
Mr. Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that *T*-223 keeps the Aslacton bells *PRO*-1 pealing.
History, after all, is not on his side.
According to a nationwide survey taken * a year ago, nearly a third of England's church bells are no longer rung *-1 on Sundays because there is no one 0 *T*-2 to ring them.
It *EXP*-1 is easy *PRO* to see why the ancient art is on the ropes *T*-2.
The less complicated version of *PRO* playing tunes on bells, as do *?* the carillons of continental Europe, is considered by the English *-136 to be childish, fit only for foreigners.
Change - ringing, a mind - boggling exercise 0 the English invented *T*-1 380 years ago, requires physical dexterity--some bells weigh more than a ton--combined * with intense mental concentration.
Proper English bells are started *-1 off in "rounds," from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest--a simple descending scale using, in larger churches, as many as 12 bells.
Then, at a signal, the ringers begin *-1 varying the order in which the bells sound *T*-2 without *PRO* altering the steady rhythm of the striking.
Each variation, or change, can occur only once, the rules state 0 *T*-1.
Ringers memorize patterns of changes, known * as "methods," which *T*-224 have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters.
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a "peal" and takes about three hours.
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved *.
Ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle, one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter's stance, each pulling a rope that *T*-225 disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber.
No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems *-1 to make as much sound as the bells themselves *?*, *PRO*-2 muffled *-3 by the ceiling.
*PRO*-1 Totally absorbed, the ringers stare straight ahead, *PRO*-1 using peripheral vision (they call it *PRO*-3 "rope - sight") *PRO*-2 to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls.
Far above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted * on wheels, swing madly through a full 360 degrees, *PRO*-1 starting and ending, surprisingly, in the inverted, or mouth - up position.
Skilled ringers use their wrists *PRO*-1 to advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change.
In a well - known detective - story involving church bells, English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a "passion {that} *T*-1 finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection."
Ringers, she added 0 *?*, are "filled *-1 with the solemn intoxication that *T*-226 comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed *."
"Ringing does become a bit of an obsession," admits *T*-1 Stephanie Pattenden, master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers.
It is a passion that *T*-227 usually stays in the tower, however.
More often than not, ringers think of the church as something stuck * on the bottom of the belfry.
When their changes are completed *-137 *T*-1, and after they have worked up a sweat, ringers often skip off to the local pub, *PRO*-2 leaving worship for others below.
This does not sit well with some clerics.
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling, strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers *PRO*-1 to attend services.
Two years ago, the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone, vicar of Great Torrington, Devon, got so fed up with ringers who *T*-228 didn't attend service 0 he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest.
"They were a self - perpetuating club that *T*-229 treated the tower as sort of a separate premises," the Vicar Hummerstone says *T*-1.
An entirely new band *ICH*-2 rings today at Great Torrington, several of whom *T*-1 are members of the congregation.
But there still aren't enough ringers 0 *T*-1 to ring more than six of the eight bells.
At St. Mary's Church in Ilminster, Somerset, the bells have fallen *PRO*-1 silent following a dust - up over church attendance.
The vicar, W.D. Jones, refuses *PRO*-1 to talk about it, *PRO*-1 saying 0 it would "reopen the wound."
But C.J.B. Marshall, vicar of a nearby church, feels 0 the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that *T*-1 are located *-138 next to the altar.
"So crunch, crunch, crunch, bang, bang, bang--here come *T*-4 the ringers from above, *PRO*-1 making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer," he says *T*-2.
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue, since he is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer himself.
"The sound of bells is a net 0 *T*-1 to draw people into the church," he says *T*-2.
"I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn *-139 into that fuller life."
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, a sort of parliament of ringing groups, aims *PRO*-1 to improve relations with vicars, says 0 *T*-2 John C. Baldwin, president.
It hopes *PRO*-1 to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled *, "*PRO*-2 The Bells in Your Care."
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Baldwin, "We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience."
Mr. Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem: lack of ringers.
One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today, only 40,000 of them still ring.
Also, ringers don't always live where the bells need *-1 to be rung *-140 *T*-2--like in small, rural parishes and inner - city churches.
But the council's program *PRO* to attract and train ringers is only partly successful, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Baldwin.
"Right now, we're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10," he adds *T*-1.
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women.
They aren't accepted *-1 everywhere, however.
The oldest bell - ringing group in the country, the Ancient Society of College Youths, founded * in 1637, remains male - only, a fact that *T*-230's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches, St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.
This being Britain, no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit, but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to "The Ringing World," a weekly newspaper for ringers.
One writer, signing his letter as "Red - blooded, balanced male," remarked on the "frequency of women fainting in peals," and suggested that they "settle back into their traditional role of *PRO* making tea at meetings."
In the torrent of replies that *T*-1 followed, one woman ringer from Solihull observed that "the average male ringer leaves quite a lot 0 *T*-2 to be desired *-141: *PRO*-3 badly dressed, decorated with acne and a large beer - belly, frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals."
Another women wrote from Sheffield *PRO*-1 to say that in her 60 years of ringing, "I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry.
I have seen one or two men die, *PRO* bless them.
Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes.
While *PRO*-1 giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16, she spotted a student looking at crib sheets.
She had seen cheating before, but these notes were uncanny.
"A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance....
At the end of World War II, Germany surrendered before Japan....
The Senate - House conference committee is used *-1 when a bill is passed *-3 by the House and Senate in different forms *T*-2."
Virtually word for word, the notes matched questions and answers on the social - studies section of the test 0 the student was taking *T*-1.
In fact, the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section.
The student surrendered the notes, but not without a protest.
"My teacher said 0 it *EXP*-1 was OK for me to use the notes on the test," he said *T*-2.
The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin--considered by many students and parents *PRO* to be one of the best at the school.
*PRO*-2 Confronted *-1, Mrs. Yeargin admitted 0 she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low - ability geography classes.
She had gone so far as *PRO*-1 to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers.
Mrs. Yeargin was fired *-1 and prosecuted *-1 under an unusual South Carolina law that *T*-79 makes it *EXP*-2 a crime *PRO* to breach test security.
In September, she pleaded guilty and paid a $500 *U* fine.
Her alternative was 90 days in jail.
Her story is partly one of personal downfall.
She was an unstinting teacher who *T*-80 won laurels and inspired students, but she will probably never teach again.
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who *T*-81 was her friend and now calls her *PRO*-84 a betrayer; of colleagues who *T*-82 say 0 she brought them shame; of students and parents who *T*-83 defended her and insist 0 she was treated *-1 harshly; and of school - district officials stunned that despite the bald - faced nature of her actions, she became something of a local martyr.
Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform, where pressures on teachers are growing *T*-1 and where high - stakes testing has enhanced the temptation *PRO* to cheat *T*-2.
The 1987 statute 0 Mrs. Yeargin violated *T*-1 was designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school - improvement laws.
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying *PRO*-1 to bolster students' scores *PRO*-1 to win a bonus under the state's 1984 Education Improvement Act.
The bonus depended on her ability *PRO* to produce higher student - test scores.
"There is incredible pressure *ICH*-2 on school systems and teachers *PRO* to raise test scores," says *T*-1 Walt Haney, an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College.
"So efforts *PRO* to beat the tests are also on the rise."
And *PRO*-1 most disturbing, it is educators, not students, who *T*-84 are blamed *-2 for much of the wrongdoing.
A 50 - state study released * in September by Friends for Education, an Albuquerque, N.M., school - research group, concluded that "outright cheating by American educators" is "common."
The group says 0 standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often "teach the test" as Mrs. Yeargin did *?*, although most are never caught *-1.
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so.
California's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that *T*-85 changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test.
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students, Texas is revising its security practices.
And sales of test - coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming.
These materials, including Macmillan / McGraw - Hill School Publishing Co.'s Scoring High and Learning Materials--are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets, according to some recent academic research.
By *PRO*-3 using them, teachers--with administrative blessing--telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate *T*-1, and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers.
Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County, Mrs. Yeargin's school district.
Experts say 0 there isn't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do *?* in South Carolina *T*-1.
Under the state's Education Improvement Act, low test scores can block students' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching, state - supervised "interventions" that *T*-86 can mean firings.
High test scores, on the other hand, bring recognition and extra money--a new computer lab for a school, grants for special projects, a bonus for the superintendent.
And South Carolina says 0 it is getting results.
Since the reforms went in place, for example, no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina *?*, although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who *T*-87 use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination.
Critics say 0 South Carolina is paying a price by *PRO* stressing improved test scores so much.
Friends of Education rates South Carolina *PRO*-1 one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating.
Says 0 *ICH*-3 the organization's founder, John Cannell, *PRO* prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is "a way for 0 administrators to protect themselves *T*-4 and look like they take cheating seriously *T*-4, when in fact they don't take it seriously at all *T*-1."
Paul Sandifer, director of testing for the South Carolina department of education, says 0 Mr. Cannell's allegations of cheating "are purely without foundation," and based on unfair inferences.
Partly because of worries about potential abuse, however, he says 0 the state will begin *-1 keeping closer track of achievement - test preparation booklets next spring.
South Carolina's reforms were designed *-1 for schools like Greenville High School.
*PRO*-1 Standing on a shaded hill in a run - down area of this old textile city, the school has educated many of South Carolina's best and brightest, including the state's last two governors, Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward.
But by the early 1980s, its glory *PPA*-1 had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade.
"It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class," says *T*-1 Linda Ward, the school's principal.
"Crime was awful, test scores were low, and there was no enrollment in honors programs."
Mrs. Ward took over in 1986, *PRO*-1 becoming the school's seventh principal in 15 years.
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown.
Prior to his term, a teacher bled to death in the halls, *PRO*-1 stabbed *-2 by a student.
Academically, Mrs. Ward says 0 *?*, the school was having trouble *PRO*-2 serving in harmony its two disparate, and evenly split, student groups: a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks, many of them poor, from run - down, inner city neighborhoods.
Mrs. Ward resolved *PRO*-1 to clean out "deadwood" in the school's faculty and restore safety, and she also had some new factors working in her behalf.
One was statewide school reform, which *T*-88 raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment.
Another was Nancy Yeargin, who *T*-89 came to Greenville in 1985, *PRO*-1 full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted *PRO*-2 to reward *T*-3.
"*PRO* Being a teacher just became my life," says *T*-1 the 37 - year - old Mrs. Yeargin, a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . "
I loved the school, its history.
I even dreamt about school and new things 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with my students."
While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled *PRO*-1 to improve curriculum, Mrs. Yeargin worked 14 - hour days and fast became a student favorite.
In 1986 - 87 and 1987 - 88, she applied for *RNR*-1 and won *RNR*-1 bonus pay under the reform law.
*PRO*-1 Encouraged *-2 by Mrs. Ward, Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state "teacher cadet" program, a reform creation designed * *PRO*-3 to encourage good students *PRO*-4 to consider teaching as a career.
She won grant money for the school, advised cheerleaders, ran the pep club, proposed and taught a new "Cultural Literacy" class in Western Civilization and was chosen *-1 by the school PTA as "Teacher of the Year."
"She was an inspirational lady; she had it all together," says *T*-1 Laura Dobson, a freshman at the University of South Carolina who *T*-90 had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher - cadet class last year.
She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying *PRO*-1 to become a teacher.
Mary Beth Marchand, a Greenville 11th grader, also says 0 Mrs. Yeargin inspired her *PRO*-1 to go into education.
"She taught us more in Western Civilization than I've ever learned in other classes," says *T*-2 Kelli Green, a Greenville senior.
In the classroom, students say 0 *?*, Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by *PRO* varying teaching approaches--*PRO*-1 forcing kids to pair up *PRO*-2 to complete classroom work or using college - bowl type competitions.
On weekends, she came to work *PRO*-1 to prepare study plans or sometimes, even *PRO*-1 to polish the furniture in her classroom.
"She just never gave it up," says *T*-1 Mary Marchand, Mary Beth's mother.
"You'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game."
Some fellow teachers, however, viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students.
Mrs. Ward says 0 she often defended her to colleagues who *T*-91 called her *PRO*-92 a grandstander.
Pressures began *-1 to build.
Friends told her 0 she was pushing too hard.
Because of deteriorating hearing, she told colleagues 0 she feared 0 she might not be able *PRO*-1 to teach much longer.
Mrs. Yeargin's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state's incentive - bonus program.
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests.
Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $5,000 *U* in bonuses over two years--a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $23,000 *U*.
*PRO* Winning a bonus for a third year wasn't that important to her, Mrs. Yeargin insists 0 *T*-1.
But others at Greenville High say 0 she was eager *PRO*-1 to win--if not for money, then for pride and recognition.
Mary Elizabeth Ariail, another social - studies teacher, says 0 she believed 0 Mrs. Yeargin wanted *PRO*-1 to keep her standing *PRO*-93 high so she could get a new job that *T*-92 wouldn't demand good hearing.
Indeed, Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program.
Last March, after *PRO*-1 attending a teaching seminar in Washington, Mrs. Yeargin says 0 she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing *PRO*-2 feeling that she hadn't prepared her low - ability geography students adequately.
When test booklets were passed *-1 out 48 hours ahead of time *T*-2, she says 0 she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students.
Mrs. Yeargin admits 0 she made a big mistake but insists 0 her motives were correct.
"I was trying *PRO*-1 to help kids in an unfair testing situation," she says *T*-2.
"Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions.
The rest were history, sociology, finance--subjects 0 they never had *T*-1."
Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted *PRO*-1 to help *PRO*-2 lift Greenville High School's overall test scores, usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried * annually by local newspapers.
Mostly, she says 0 *?*, she wanted *PRO*-2 to prevent the damage to self - esteem that her low - ability students would suffer *T*-3 from *PRO* doing badly on the test.
"These kids broke my heart," she says *T*-1.
"A whole day goes by and no one even knows 0 they're alive.
They desperately needed somebody who *T*-93 showed 0 they cared for them, who *T*-94 loved them.
The last thing 0 they needed *T*-1 was another drag - down blow."
School officials and prosecutors say 0 Mrs. Yeargin is lying.
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who *T*-95 said 0 she gave them similar help, although because the case wasn't tried *-2 in court, this evidence was never presented *-1 publicly.
"That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out *PRO*-1 to help the poor underprivileged child," says Joe Watson, the prosecutor in the case, who *T*-96 is also president of Greenville High School's alumni association.
Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class, *PRO*-1 adding: "I wanted *PRO*-2 to help all" students.
Mr. Watson says 0 Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair.
"Do I have much sympathy for her?" Mr. Watson asks *T*-1.
"Not really.
I believe in the system.
I believe 0 you have *-1 to use the system *PRO*-2 to change it.
What she did *T*-97 was like *PRO* taking the law into your own hands."
Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered *-4 *T*-1, she wanted *PRO*-2 to avoid the morale - damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring *T*-3.
She says 0 she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought 0 she could help *PRO*-1 save her teaching certificate.
Mrs. Yeargin declined.
"She said something like ` You just want *PRO*-1 to make it easy for the school . '
I was dumbfounded," Mrs. Ward recalls *T*-1.
"It was like someone had turned a knife in me."
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities--and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests--Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support.
The school - board hearing at which she was dismissed *-2 *T*-1 was crowded *-4 with students, teachers and parents who *T*-98 came *PRO*-3 to testify on her behalf.
Supportive callers decried unfair testing, not Mrs. Yeargin, on a local radio talk show on which she appeared *T*-1.
The show didn't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin's offense, *PRO*-1 saying only that she helped students do better on the test.
"The message to the board of education out of all this is 0 we've got *-1 to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies *T*-2 in this state," said *T*-3 the talk - show host.
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong, but also said 0 the case showed how testing was being overused *-2 *T*-1.
The radio show "enraged us," says *T*-1 Mrs. Ward.
Partly because of the show, Mr. Watson says 0 *?*, the district decided not *PRO*-2 to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first - time offenders program that *T*-99 could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record.
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case.
Over 50 witnesses, mostly students, were interviewed *-1.
At Greenville High School, meanwhile, some students--especially on the cheerleading squad--were crushed *-1.
"It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to explain to a 17 - year - old why someone 0 they like *T*-2 had *-3 to go *T*-5," says *T*-4 Mrs. Ward.
Soon, T - shirts *ICH*-1 appeared in the corridors that *T*-2 carried the school's familiar red - and - white GHS logo on the front.
On the back, the shirts read, "We have all the answers."
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin.
"She did a lot of harm," says *T*-1 Cathryn Rice, who *T*-100 had discovered the crib notes.
"We work damn hard at what we do *T*-101 for damn little pay, and what she did *T*-1 cast unfair aspersions on all of us."
But several teachers also say 0 the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of *PRO* evaluating teachers or schools by *PRO* using standardized test scores.
Says *ICH*-1 Gayle Key, a mathematics teacher, "The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms.
There may be others doing what she did *T*-1."
Mrs. Yeargin says 0 she pleaded guilty because she realized 0 it *EXP*-2 would no longer be possible *PRO*-1 to win reinstatement, and because she was afraid of further charges.
Mrs. Ward, for one, was relieved.
Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin, popular sentiment *ICH*-1 was so strong *ICH*-3 in her favor, Mrs. Ward says 0 *?*, that "I'm afraid 0 a jury wouldn't have convicted her.
Your Oct. 13 page - one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance *PRO* to be in the telephone business by *PRO*-1 turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph.
Such is hardly the case.
Bell's father - in - law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well - connected, obtained financing 0 *T*-1 to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which *T*-2 even had a subsidiary in New York called *PRO* *PRO*-3 the Telephone Co. of New York.
This is where Bell's patents went *T*-1.
Western Union indeed wanted *PRO*-1 to get into the telephone business.
It acquired Thomas Edison's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. *PRO*-1 claiming that the microphone invented * by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which *T*-2 had been sold *-144 to Bell for a princely $50,000 *U*, infringed upon Western Union's Edison patent.
When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered *-145 10 days before Edison's application *T*-1, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed *PRO*-2 never to enter the telephone business--the basis for the company's current plight.

While worry *ICH*-1 grows about big Japanese investments in the U.S., Japan's big trading companies are rapidly increasing their stake in America's smaller business.
For Japan, the controversial trend improves access to American markets and technology.
But for small American companies, it also provides a growing source of capital and even marketing help.
*PRO* Take the deal with Candela Laser Corp., a Wayland, Mass., manufacturer of high - tech medical devices, which three years ago *T*-1 set its sights on Japan as an export market.
Partly *PRO*-1 to help *PRO*-2 clear the myriad obstacles facing any overseas company trying *PRO* to penetrate Japan, tiny Candela turned to Mitsui & Co., one of Japan's largest trading companies, for investment.
In a joint - venture deal, Mitsui guided Candela through Tokyo's bureaucratic maze.
It eventually secured Ministry of Health import approval for two Candela laser products--one that *T*-189 breaks up kidney stones and another that *T*-190 treats skin lesions.
At last count, Candela had sold $4 million *U* of its medical devices in Japan.
The deal also gave Mitsui access to a high - tech medical product.
"They view this as a growth area so they went about it with a systematic approach," says *T*-1 Richard Olsen, a Candela vice president.
Indeed, for many Japanese trading companies, the favorite U.S. small business is one whose research and development *T*-1 can be milked *-117 for future Japanese use.
The Japanese companies bankroll many small U.S. companies with promising products or ideas, *PRO*-1 frequently putting their money behind projects that commercial banks won't touch *T*-191.
Japanese companies have financed small and medium - sized U.S. firms for years, but in recent months, the pace has taken off.
In the first half of 1989 alone, Japanese corporations invested $214 million *U* *ICH*-2 in minority positions in U.S. companies, a 61% rise from the figure for all of 1987, reports 0 *T*-1 Venture Economics Inc.
The Needham, Mass., concern tracks investments in new businesses.
In addition, of course, some of the Japanese investments involved outright purchase of small U.S. firms.
Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large, highly visible U.S. corporations, such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
Only this week, it *EXP*-1 was announced *-118 that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group, which *T*-192 owns New York's prestigious Rockefeller Center.
While the small deals are far less conspicuous, they add to Japanese penetration of the U.S. market.
As the deals also improve Japanese access to American technology and market knowledge, they feed American anxieties in this area, too.
Even a low - tech product like plate glass can catch a trading company's fancy if there's a strategic fit.
Free State Glass Industries of Warrenton, Va., a small fabricator of architectural glass, was foundering under its original management.
Last year, Mitsubishi International Corp., the New York - based arm of Mitsubishi Corp., bought controlling interest in the glass company in a joint venture with Ronald Bodner, a glass industry executive and Mitsubishi consultant.
The deal is chiefly designed *-1 *PRO*-3 to give Mitsubishi a window on the U.S. glass industry, says *T*-2 Ichiro Wakui, an executive in Mitsubishi's general merchandise department in New York.
"It's not just a simple investment in a small company," Mr. Wakui says *T*-1.
"We want *PRO*-1 to see the glass market from the inside, not the outside."
Mitsubishi's investment in Free State is "very small...less than $4 million *U*," Mr. Wakui says 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Bodner declines *PRO*-1 to comment on the arrangement.
Trading companies such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, C. Itoh & Co. and Nissho - Iwai Corp., which *T*-193 make many of the Japanese investments in small U.S. concerns, have no U.S. counterpart.
These vertically integrated combines, some of which *T*-1 got their start in Japan's feudal period, deal globally in commodities, construction and manufacturing.
They operate ships and banks.
"All the "sogo - shosha" are looking for new business," says *T*-1 Arthur Klauser, adviser to the president of Mitsui, U.S.A., *PRO*-2 using the Japanese term for the largest of the global trading houses.
Adds *ICH*-1 Takeshi Kondo, senior vice president of C. Itoh America Inc.: "We have a great interest in *PRO* making investments, particularly in new ventures."
A host of electronics firms in California's Silicon Valley were financed *-119 with trading - company venture capital.
Profit, at least in the short term, is usually a secondary goal.
"Strategic objectives, not financial return, drive many of the deals," says *T*-1 a Venture Economics spokesman.
In *PRO* investing on the basis of future transactions, a role often performed * by merchant banks, trading companies can cut through the logjam that small - company owners often face *T*-1 with their local commercial banks.
"It's the classic problem of the small businessman," says *T*-1 Malcolm Davies, managing director of Trading Alliance Corp. of New York.
"People are queuing at the door *PRO*-1 to take his product but he doesn't have the working capital 0 *PRO* to make the thing *T*-2 and commercial banks are very unsympathetic.
They want assets, they want a balance sheet, which *T*-194 has no relation to the business 0 a company can generate *T*-1."
Adds *ICH*-1 Mitsui's Mr. Klauser: "Unlike corporations in this country, trading companies aren't so much interested in a high return on investment as they are *?* on *PRO* increasing trade flows.
To the extent 0 they can do this *T*-3, they're quite content *PRO*-1 to get a return on investment of 1% to 2% *U*."
Mr. Klauser says 0 Mitsui has 75 U.S. subsidiaries in which it holds 35% interest or more *T*-1 and the trading company hopes *PRO*-2 to double the number of its U.S. affiliates in 1990.
Sales by these subsidiaries in the fiscal year ending last March were more than $17 billion *U*.
A 1% to 2% *U* return on $17 billion *U* "ain't hay," Mr. Klauser says 0 *T*-1.
Signs of a slowing economy are increasing pressure *ICH*-2 on the Federal Reserve *PRO* to cut short - term interest rates, but it *EXP*-1 isn't clear whether the central bank will do so.
A survey by the Fed's 12 district banks shows 0 economic growth has been sluggish in recent weeks, while upward pressures on prices have moderated.
"The economy is clearly slowing," says *T*-1 Robert Black, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.
"If you look at the third quarter as *PRO* posting roughly 2.5% growth, I do see some slowing in the fourth quarter," agrees *T*-1 Kansas City Fed President Roger Guffey.
Nevertheless, both Mr. Guffey and Mr. Black say 0 the slowdown so far is no cause for concern.
"We're coming closer to *PRO* achieving the stated objective of *PRO* slowing the economy to a point where hopefully some downward trend in prices will occur *T*-1," said Mr. Guffey.
Bush administration officials are looking to the Fed *PRO*-1 to bring down rates, and financial markets seem *-2 to be expecting easier credit as well.
"I think 0 the market had been expecting the Fed to ease sooner and a little more than it has *?* to date," said *T*-1 Robert Johnson, vice president of global markets for Bankers Trust Co.
The Fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about 0.25 percentage point to 8.75% after the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, but has shown no sign of movement since.
The report from the Fed found that manufacturing, in particular, has been weak in recent weeks.
The Philadelphia Fed, for instance, reported that manufacturing activity "continues *-1 to decline" for the fourth month in a row.
And in the Chicago district, the report said 0 *?*, "a manufacturer of capital goods noted slower orders for some types, including defense equipment, petroleum equipment, food packaging machinery and material handling equipment."
Retail sales also were reported *-1 slow in most districts, particularly "for discretionary, big - ticket items such as furniture, home appliances and consumer electronics."
And construction also was described *-101 as slow in most areas.
Despite the economic slowdown, there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt.
As a result, Fed officials may be divided *-102 over whether *PRO*-102 to ease credit.
Several Fed governors in Washington have been pushing for easier credit; but many of the regional Fed presidents have been resisting such a move.
Mr. Black said 0 he is "pleased" with the economy's recent performance, and doesn't see "a lot of excesses *ICH*-1 out there that *T*-3 would tilt us into recession."
"There is always a chance of recession," added *?* Mr. Guffey, "but if you ask me *PRO*-3 to put a percentage on it, I would think 0 it's well below a 50% chance.
R.P. Scherer Corp. said 0 it completed the $10.2 million *U* sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led * by the unit's president, Thomas R. Sloan, and other managers.
Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy - out group led * by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year, the maker of gelatin capsules decided *PRO*-1 to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses.
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program.
This is the year 0 the negative ad, for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns, became the main event *T*-1.
The irony is that the attack commercial, after *PRO*-1 getting a boost in last year's presidential campaign, has come of age in an off - off election year with only a few contests scattered * across the country.
But in the three leading political contests of 1989, the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility, *PRO*-1 raising fears that this kind of mudslinging, empty of significant issues, is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content.
"Now," says *?* Joseph Napolitan, a pioneer in political television, "the idea is *PRO* to attack first, last and always."
A trend that *T*-72 started with the first stirrings of politics, accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes - tawdry art form in 1988, has reached an entirely new stage.
"*PRO*-1 To get people's attention these days," says *?* Douglas Bailey, a political consultant, "your TV ad needs *-1 to be bold and entertaining, and, more often than not, that means confrontational.
And, unlike a few years ago, you don't even have *-1 to worry whether the ad is truthful."
In 1989, as often as not, the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted *-1 by the ads themselves.
*PRO* Take a look, then, at the main attack commercials that *T*-73 set the tone for Tuesday's elections in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia:
New York City:
The screen fills with a small, tight facial shot of David Dinkins, Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City.
"David Dinkins failed *-2 to file his income taxes for four straight years," says *T*-1 a disembodied male voice.
And then this television commercial, paid for * by Republican Rudolph Giuliani's campaign and produced * by Roger Ailes, the master of negative TV ads, really gets down to business.
Mr. Dinkins, the ad charges 0 *?*, also failed *-1 to report his campaign contributions accurately, hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper "through a phony organization with no members, no receipts and no office."
"David Dinkins," says *?* the kicker, "Why does he always wait until he's caught *-1 *T*-3?"
"Nasty innuendoes," says *-2 John Siegal, Mr. Dinkins's issues director, "designed * *PRO*-1 to prosecute a case of political corruption that *T*-74 simply doesn't exist."
*PRO*-2 Stung *-1 by the Giuliani ads, Mr. Dinkins's TV consultants, Robert Shrum and David Doak, finally unleashed a negative ad of their own.
The screen shows two distorted, unrecognizable photos, presumably of two politicians.
"*PRO* Compare two candidates for mayor," says *T*-1 the announcer.
"One says 0 he's for *PRO* banning cop - killer bullets.
The other has opposed a ban on cop - killer bullets.
One claims 0 he's pro-choice.
The other has opposed a woman's right *PRO* to choose."
"Funny thing," says *T*-1 the kicker, "both these candidates are named *-2 *PRO*-3 Rudolph Giuliani."
Who's *T*-1 telling the truth?
Everybody--and nobody.
It's a classic situation of ads that *T*-75 are true but not always fully accurate.
Mr. Dinkins did fail *-1 to file his income taxes for four years, but he insists 0 he voluntarily admitted the "oversight" when he was being considered *-2 for a city job *T*-3.
He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems, but he insists 0 he made no secret of it.
The city's Campaign Finance Board has refused *PRO*-1 to pay Mr. Dinkins $95,142 *U* in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete.
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors.
And, says 0 *?* Mr. Dinkins, he didn't know 0 the man 0 his campaign paid *T*-2 for a *PRO* get - out - the - vote effort had been convicted *-3 of kidnapping.
But, say 0 *?* Mr. Dinkins's managers, he did have an office and his organization did have members.
Mr. Giuliani's campaign chairman, Peter Powers, says 0 the Dinkins ad is "deceptive."
The other side, he argues 0 *?*, "knows 0 Giuliani has always been pro-choice, even though he has personal reservations.
They know 0 he is generally opposed to cop - killer bullets, but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation."
Virginia:
Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced * by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree 0 *T*-1 was a tour de force.
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed * on an American flag, an announcer talks about the "strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty" that Virginians have nurtured *T*-1 for generations.
Then, just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen, the announcer continues: "On the issue of abortion, Marshall Coleman wants *PRO*-1 to take away your right *PRO* to choose and *PRO*-1 give it to the politicians."
That commercial--which *T*-76 said 0 Mr. Coleman wanted *PRO*-1 to take away the right of abortion "even in cases of rape and incest," a charge 0 Mr. Coleman denies *T*-2--changed the dynamics of the campaign, *PRO*-3 transforming it, at least in part, into a referendum on abortion.
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman, the former Virginia attorney general, *PRO*-78 to launch a series of advertisements created * by Bob Goodman and designed * *PRO*-2 to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who *T*-77 were attracted *-1 by the abortion ad.
The Coleman counterattack featured a close - up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal.
A voice says, "C'mon, now, don't you have boyfriends?"
Then an announcer interjects: "It was Douglas Wilder who *T*-78 introduced a bill 0 *T*-1 to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated *-2 about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists.
So the next time 0 Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women *T*-1, *PRO* ask him about this law 0 he tried *PRO*-3 to pass *T*-2."
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago, but he did so at the request of a constituent, a common legislative technique used * by lawmakers.
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced *-1 "by request," and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill 0 *T*-2 to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation.
"People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of *PRO* being a negative campaigner," says *T*-1 Mark Rozell, a political scientist at Mary Washington College.
"Wilder has managed *PRO*-1 to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything *PRO*-2 to get elected *-3 *PRO*-4 governor and--*PRO* more important--has been able *PRO*-1 to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman."
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning, but the truce lasted only hours.
By Tuesday night, television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder's sensitivity to rape victims.
New Jersey:
The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio's rival, Republican Rep. Jim Courter *T*-1.
"*PRO* Remember Pinocchio?" says *T*-1 a female voice.
"*PRO* Consider Jim Courter."
And then this commercial, produced * by Bob Squier, gets down to its own mean and dirty business.
Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus, and the female voice purrs, "That hazardous waste on his {Mr. Courter's} property--the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud."
And the nose on Mr. Courter's face grows.
The only fraud involved, cry *?* Mr. Courter's partisans, is the Florio commercial itself, and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial, produced * by Mr. Ailes.
In this one, the screen fills with photographs of both candidates.
"Who *T*-1's really lying?" asks *T*-2 a female voice.
"Florio's lying," the voice goes on, because "the barrel on Courter's land...contained heating oil, was cleaned *-1 up and caused no pollution."
Mr. Courter's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio's grows.
Who *T*-1's telling the truth?
Stephen Salmore, a political scientist at New Jersey's Eagleton Institute, says 0 it's another example of an ad that *T*-1's true but not fully accurate.
Barrels were dumped *-1 on the Courter property, a complaint was made *-2, but there is no evidence 0 the barrels were a serious threat to the environment.
Even so, according to Mr. Salmore, the ad was "devastating" because it raised questions about Mr. Courter's credibility.
But it's building on a long tradition.
In 1966, on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor, GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person *PRO*-1 saying, "If you want *PRO*-2 to keep the crime rates *PRO*-3 high, O'Connor is your man."
Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate.
Allergan Inc. said 0 it received Food and Drug Administration approval *PRO* to sell the PhacoFlex intraocular lens, the first foldable silicone lens available for cataract surgery.
The len's foldability enables it to be inserted *-1 in smaller incisions than *PRO* are now possible for cataract surgery, the eye care and skin care concern said 0 *T*-3.
Cataracts refer to a clouding of the eye's natural lens.
The House passed legislation designed *PRO* to make it easier for the Transportation Department to block airline leveraged buy - outs.
The final vote came after the House rejected Republican efforts *PRO* to weaken the bill and approved two amendments sought * by organized labor.
The Bush administration has threatened *PRO*-1 to veto such a bill because of what it views *T*-2 as an undesirable intrusion into the affairs of industry, but the 300 - 113 vote suggests that supporters have the potential 0 *PRO* to override a veto *T*-3.
The broader question is where the Senate stands *T*-1 on the issue.
While the Senate Commerce Committee has approved legislation similar to the House bill on airline leveraged buy - outs, the measure hasn't yet come to the full floor.
Although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline, it is aimed *-25 at *PRO* giving the Transportation Department the chance *PRO* to review in advance transactions financed * by large amounts of debt.
"The purpose of the bill is *PRO* to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that *T*-2 would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability *PRO* to compete," Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, (R., Ark .) said *T*-1.
The bill, as it was approved *-26 by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days 0 *PRO* to review any purchase of 15% or more of the stock in an airline *T*-1.
The department would be required *-1 *PRO*-29 to block the buy - out if the acquisition is likely *-2 to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired *-27; its ability *PRO* to compete would be sharply diminished *-3; it would be put *-28 into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline - related assets--unless *PRO* selling such assets had an overriding public benefit.
The House approved an amendment offered * by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) that *T*-1 would, in addition to the previous criteria, also require the department *PRO*-3 to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred * were likely *-2 to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees, or their wages or benefits.
Rep. James Traficant (D., Ohio), said 0 the amendment, which *T*-19 passed 271 - 147, would "let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally."
But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision, which he dubbed *T*-2 *PRO*-3 a "special interest" amendment, was likely *-1 to make the bill even more controversial.
On Tuesday, the House approved a labor - backed amendment that *T*-1 would require the Transportation Department *PRO*-5 to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking *PRO* to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines *ICH*-4 previously that *T*-2 have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The provision, called *PRO* *PRO*-30 the "two - time - losers" amendment by its supporters, apparently was aimed *-29 at *PRO* preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO* to take over another airline.
John F. Barrett, 40, formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 president and chief operating officer, posts which *T*-2 had been vacant.
David A. DiLoreto, president of metal container division, was named *-1 to the additional post of group vice president, packaging products, at this packaging, industrial and aerospace products concern, *PRO*-1 succeeding Delmont A. Davis, who *T*-3 was named *-2 *PRO*-4 president and chief operating officer in August.
Robert L. Bernstein, chairman and president of Random House Inc., announced his resignation from the publishing house 0 he has run *T*-1 for 23 years.
A successor wasn't named *-1, which *T*-35 fueled speculation that Mr. Bernstein may have clashed with S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family company, Advance Publications Inc., *T*-2 owns Random House.
Abrupt departures aren't unheard of *-1 within the Newhouse empire.
In an interview, Mr. Bernstein said 0 his departure "evolved out of discussions with Si Newhouse and that's the decision 0 I reached *T*-1."
He declined *PRO*-1 to elaborate, other than *PRO*-1 to say, "It just seemed the right thing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 at this minute.
Sometimes you just go with your gut."
Mr. Bernstein said 0 he will stay until Dec. 31 and work with his successor, who *T*-36 is *-1 to be named *-43 soon.
Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, insisted that he isn't unhappy with Mr. Bernstein or the performance of Random House, the largest trade publishing house in the U.S. .
The company said 0 the publisher's annual sales volume increased to $800 million *U* from $40 million *U* during Mr. Bernstein's tenure.
"Bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite brilliantly," said *T*-1 Mr. Newhouse.
"The company is doing well, it's stable, it's got good people.
Bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time."
Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years, some of the bigger ones haven't been absorbed *-44 so easily.
Crown Publishing Group, acquired * last year, is said *-1 to be turning in disappointing results.
As a private company, Random House doesn't report its earnings.
Mr. Bernstein, who *T*-37 succeeded Bennett Cerf, has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded *-45 in 1925.
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house.
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen, president of Ballantine / Del Rey / Fawcett, Random House's huge and successful paperback division.
Some say 0 Anthony Cheetham, head of a recently acquired British company, Century Hutchinson, could be chosen *-46.
There is also speculation that Mr. Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member 0 *T*-1 to run the business side, in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb, who *T*-38 left Random House's Alfred A. Knopf *PRO*-2 to run the New Yorker, also owned * by the Newhouse family.
Not included on the most - likely - successor list are Joni Evans, recruited * two years ago *PRO* to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House, and Sonny Mehta, president of the prestigious Alfred A. Knopf unit.
When Ms. Evans took her job *T*-1, several important divisions that *T*-2 had reported to her predecessor weren't included *-3 partly because she didn't wish *PRO*-4 to be a full - time administrator.
Mr. Mehta is widely viewed *-1 as a brilliant editor but a less - than - brilliant administrator and his own departure was rumored *-47 recently.
Mr. Bernstein, a tall, energetic man who *T*-39 is widely respected *-1 as a publishing executive, has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues.
Some Democrats in Congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years.
The funding mechanism, which *T*-80 has received congressional approval and is expected *-1 to be signed *-83 by President Bush, would affect the antitrust operations of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
As a part of overall efforts *PRO* to reduce spending, Congress cut by $30 million *U* the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990, which *T*-81 began Oct. 1.
*PRO*-1 To offset the reduction, Congress approved a $20,000 *U* fee that investors and companies will have *-3 to pay *T*-2 each time 0 they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers, acquisitions and certain other transactions *T*-4.
Some Democrats, led * by Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts.
But Justice Department and FTC officials said 0 they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them.
"It could operate *PRO*-1 to augment our budget," James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, said *T*-2 in an interview.
Under measures approved * by both houses of Congress, the administration's request for $47 million *U* for the Antitrust Division would be cut *-84 $15 million *U*.
The FTC budget request of $70 million *U*, about $34 million *U* of which *T*-1 would go for antitrust enforcement, would also be cut *-85 by $15 million *U*.
The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as *PRO* was appropriated *-1 in fiscal 1989.
The offsetting fees would apply to filings made * under the Hart - Scott - Rodino Act.
Under that law, parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued * at $15 million *U* or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before *PRO*-1 completing the transactions.
Currently, the government charges nothing for such filings.
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that, based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year, the fees will yield at least $40 million *U* *ICH*-1 this fiscal year, or $10 million *U* more than the budget cuts.
"When you do that *T*-1, there is not a cut, but there is in fact a program increase of $5 million *U*" each for the FTC and the Justice Department, Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa) said 0 *T*-2 during House debate.
But Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif .) responded that a recession could stifle merger activity, *PRO*-1 reducing the amount of fees collected *.
The antitrust staffs of both the FTC and Justice Department were cut *-87 more than 40% in the Reagan administration, and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period.
"Today is not the time 0 *PRO* to signal that Congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen *T*-3 *T*-2," Mr. Edwards argued 0 *T*-1.
Any money in excess of $40 million *U* collected * from the fees in fiscal 1990 would go to the Treasury at large.
Corporate lawyers said 0 the new fees wouldn't inhibit many mergers or other transactions.
Though some lawyers reported that prospective acquirers were scrambling *PRO*-1 to make filings before the fees take effect, government officials said 0 they hadn't noticed any surge in filings.
A House - Senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $500 million *U* in economic aid for Poland that *T*-1 relies heavily on $240 million *U* in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of *PRO* stimulating future trade and investment.
For the Agency for International Development, appropriators approved $200 million *U* in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program, and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp. are increased *-3 by $40 million *U* over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package.
The conference approved at least $55 million *U* in direct cash and development assistance as well, and though no decision was made *-4, both sides are committed to *PRO* adding more than $200 million *U* in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought * by the Bush administration.
The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill, which *T*-9 has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year's budget.
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in *PRO* shaping the Poland package, and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending, the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on U.S. aid to Eastern Europe.
*PRO*-1 To accommodate the additional cash assistance, the House Appropriations Committee last week was required *-1 *PRO*-2 to reallocate an estimated $140 million *U* from the Pentagon.
And though the size of the loan guarantees approved * yesterday is significant, recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively.
The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved $220 million *U* for international population planning activities, an 11% increase over fiscal 1989.
The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations, but the size of the increase is itself significant.
In a second area of common concern, the world environment, an additional $15 million *U* *ICH*-1 will be provided *-7 in development assistance 0 *T*-2 to fund a series of initiatives, related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant.
The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments, running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama's quota of exports to the profitable U.S. market.
Panama was stripped *-8 of this right because of U.S. differences with the Noriega regime, but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30,537 metric tons over a 21 - month period ending Sept. 30, 1990.
About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated *-9, according to the industry, but the remaining 23,403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current U.S. price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate.
The potential sales are nearly $9.3 million *U*, and House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa .) began the bidding this year by *PRO*-1 proposing language that the quota be allocated *-10 to English - speaking countries of the Caribbean, such as Jamaica and Barbados.
Rep. Jerry Lewis, a conservative Californian, added a provision of his own intended *PRO* to assist Bolivia, and the Senate then broadened the list further by *PRO*-1 including all countries in the U.S. Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines - *PRO*-1 backed * by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen. Daniel Inouye.
Jamaica, wary of *PRO* upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies, has apparently instructed its lobbyist *PRO*-2 to abandon the provision initially drafted * by Mr. Gray, but the greater question is whether Mr. Inouye, who *T*-10 has strong ties to the sugar industry, is able *PRO*-3 to insert a claim by the Philippines.
In separate floor action, the House waived budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $3.18 billion *U* in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal 1990.
The funding is attached *-11 to an estimated $27.1 billion *U* transportation bill that *T*-1 goes *ICH*-2 next to the Senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all U.S. domestic airline flights.
The leadership hopes *PRO*-1 to move the compromise measure promptly to the White House, but in recent days, the Senate has been as likely *PRO*-3 to bounce bills back to the House.
The most recent example was a nearly $17.3 billion *U* fiscal 1990 bill funding the State, Justice and Commerce departments.
And after *PRO*-1 losing a battle Tuesday night with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, appropriators from both houses are expected *-1 to be forced *-12 back to conference.
First Chicago Corp. said 0 it completed its $55.1 million *U* cash - and - stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp., another Chicago bank holding company.
Dell Computer Corp. said 0 it cut prices on several of its personal computer lines by 5% to 17% *U*.
The Austin, Texas - based company, which *T*-1 specializes in the direct sale of personal computers and accessories, said 0 its price cuts include a $100 *U* reduction on its System 210 computer with 512 kilobytes of memory, a 40 - megabyte hard disk and a color monitor.
That package now sells for about $2,099 *U*.
A computer using the more - advanced Intel Corp. 386 microprocessor, with four megabytes of memory and a 100 - megabyte hard disk now sells for $5,699 *U*, down from $6,799 *U*.
Personal computer prices for models using the Intel 286 and 386 microprocessors, which the Dell models use *T*-1, generally have been coming down as chip prices have fallen.
FALL BALLOT ISSUES set a record for off - year elections.
Odd - year elections attract relatively few ballot issues.
But the 1989 fall total of 80, while well below 1988 activity, shows "a steady ratcheting up in citizen referenda and initiatives," says 0 *T*-1 Patrick McGuigan, editor of Family, Law and Democracy Report.
He says 0 the 10 citizen - sparked issues on state ballots this fall represent the most in any odd - year this decade.
Ballot questions range from a Maine initiative on *PRO* banning Cruise missiles to a referendum on *PRO* increasing the North Dakota income tax.
Ballot watchers say 0 attention already is focused *-1 on the 1990 elections.
In California, two petition drives for next year's election are "essentially finished," says 0 *T*-1 David Schmidt, author of "Citizen Lawmakers."
Mr. McGuigan cites three completed efforts in Oklahoma.
Hot ballot topics are expected *-1 to be abortion, the environment and insurance reform.
*PRO*-1 Taking a cue from California, more politicians will launch their campaigns by *PRO*-1 backing initiatives, says 0 *T*-2 David Magleby of Brigham Young University.
PHOTOGRAPH COLLECTING gains new stature as prices rise.
Price records are being set at auctions this week.
At Christie's, a folio of 21 prints from Alfred Stieglitz's "Equivalents" series sold for $396,000 *U*, a single - lot record.
Other works also have been exceeding price estimates.
In part, prices reflect development of a market structure based * on such variables as the number of prints.
This information used *-1 to be poorly documented and largely anecdotal, says 0 *T*-2 Beth Gates - Warren of Sotheby's.
"There is finally some sort of sense in the market," she says *T*-1.
Corporations and museums are among the serious buyers, *PRO* giving greater market stability, says 0 *T*-1 Robert Persky of the Photograph Collector.
"When I see prints going into the hands of institutions *T*-1, I know 0 they aren't going *-2 to come back on the market."
Most in demand: classic photographs by masters such as Stieglitz and Man Ray.
But much contemporary work is also fetching "a great deal of money," says 0 *T*-1 Miles Barth of the International Center of Photography.
*PRO* DIALING 900 brings callers a growing number of services.
*PRO*-1 Currently a $300 million *U* - a - year business, 900 telephone service is expected *-1 to hit $500 million *U* next year and near $2 billion *U* by 1992 as uses for the service continue *-3 to expand, says 0 *T*-2 Joel Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
The service--which *T*-2 costs the caller from 30 cents to $25 *U* a minute--currently is dominated *-1 by celebrity chatter, horoscopes and romance lines.
But more serious applications are in the wings, and that is where the future growth is expected *-1 *T*-2.
"I'm starting *-1 to see more business transactions," says *T*-2 Andrea West of American Telephone & Telegraph Co., *PRO*-3 noting growing interest in use of 900 service for stock sales, software tutorials and even service contracts.
Colleges, she says 0 *?*, are eyeing registration through 900 service.
Charities test the waters, but they face legal barriers to electronic fund raising.
"The thing that *T*-1 will really break this market right open is merchandising," Ms. West says *T*-2.
Much of the 800 service will "migrate to 900," predicts *T*-1 Jack Lawless, general manager of US Sprint's 900 product.
FAMILY PETS are improving recovery rates of patients at Columbia Hospital, Milwaukee.
Patients who *T*-1 receive canine or feline visitors are found *-2 to have lower blood pressure and improved appetite and be more receptive to therapy, says 0 *T*-3 Mary Ann O'Loughlin, program coordinator.
TIRED OF *PRO* TRIMMING?
Hammacher Schlemmer & Co. offers a fiber - optic Christmas tree that *T*-1 eliminates the need *PRO* to string lights.
The $6,500 *U* tree is designed *-1 *PRO*-2 to send continuously changing colored light to dozens of fiber - end bunches.
MEDICINE TRANSPLANT: Growth of Japanese trade and travel prompts Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, *PRO*-1 to set up a bilingual medical practice.
*PRO*-1 Funded *-2 by a $1 million *U* gift from Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance, the service will follow Japanese medical protocols, including emphasis on preventative medicine.
DIAPER SERVICES make a comeback amid growing environmental concerns.
*PRO*-1 Concerned about shrinking landfills and the safety of chemicals used * in super-absorbent disposables, parents are returning to the cloth diaper.
Tiny Tots Inc., Campbell, Calif., says 0 business is up 35% in the past year.
"We're gaining 1,200 new customers each week," says *T*-1 Jack Mogavero of General Health Care Corp., Piscataway, N.J.
In Syracuse, N.Y., DyDee Service's new marketing push stresses environmental awareness.
Among its new customers: day - care centers that *T*-1 previously spurned the service.
The National Association of Diaper Services, Philadelphia, says that since January it has gotten more than 672 inquiries from people interested in *PRO* starting diaper services.
Elisa Hollis launched a diaper service last year because State College, Pa., where she lives *T*-1, didn't have one.
Diaper shortages this summer limited growth at Stork Diaper Services, Springfield, Mass., where business is up 25% in *T*-1
*PRO* Also spurring the move to cloth: diaper covers with Velcro fasteners that *T*-1 eliminate the need for safety pins.

Freeport - McMoRan Inc. said 0 it will convert its Freeport - McMoRan Energy Partners Ltd. partnership into a publicly traded company through the exchange of units of the partnership for common shares.
The company said 0 the restructuring isn't expected *-1 to have any impact, adverse or otherwise, on its financial results.
Freeport - McMoRan, a New Orleans - based diversified energy conglomerate, said 0 the partnership will exchange its assets for common shares of a *PRO* yet - to - be - formed *-1 entity.
Freeport - McMoRan Energy Partners will be liquidated *-1 and shares of the new company distributed *-3 to the partnership's unitholders.
Unitholders will receive two additional 55 cents - a - unit distribution payments before the trust is liquidated *-1 in early 1990, the company said 0 *T*-2.
It is expected that common shares equal to the number of units outstanding--about 108 million on Sept. 30--will be issued *-3 during the first quarter of 1990.
Freeport - McMoRan, the parent company, holds roughly 80% of the units outstanding.
Wall Street's big securities firms face the prospect of *PRO* having their credit ratings lowered.
The reason: Risks from the firms' new "merchant banking" activities are rising as revenue from the industry's traditional business erodes.
The downgrading of debt issued * by CS First Boston Inc., parent of First Boston Corp., by Moody's Investors Service Inc., *PRO* coupled * with a Moody's announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is under review for a possible downgrade, sent shivers through the brokerage community this week.
With the shudders came *T*-2 the realization that some of Wall Street's biggest players are struggling *PRO*-1 to maintain the stellar credit standing required *PRO* to finance their activities profitably.
Securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper, or short - term corporate IOUs, which they sell *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to finance their daily operations.
The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper.
But Moody's warned that Shearson's commercial paper rating could be lowered *-1 soon, a move that *T*-2 would reduce Shearson's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms.
Shearson is 62% - owned by American Express Co.
"Just as the 1980s bull market transformed the U.S. securities business, so too will *?* the more difficult environment of the 1990s," says *T*-1 Christopher T. Mahoney, a Moody's vice president.
"A sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible."
Standard & Poor's Corp. says 0 First Boston, Shearson and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., in particular, are likely *-1 to have difficulty *PRO*-2 shoring up their credit standing in months ahead.
What *T*-1 worries credit - rating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking long - term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy - out and junk bond financings.
That's a departure from their traditional practice of *PRO* transferring almost all financing risks to investors.
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured *-3 *PRO*-4 to be sold *-1 quickly, Wall Street's new penchant for leveraged buy - outs and junk bonds is resulting in long - term lending commitments that *T*-2 stretch out for months or years.
"The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer - term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays" in *PRO* getting their money back, says 0 *T*-2 Jeffrey Bowman, a vice president at S&P, which *T*-1 raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston *T*-3.
"Wall Street is facing a Catch - 22 situation," says *T*-1 Mr. Mahoney of Moody's.
Merchant banking, where firms commit their own money *T*-1, "is getting riskier, and there's less of it 0 *T*-2 to go around."
In addition, he says *?* *ICH*-2, the buy - out business is under pressure "because of the junk bond collapse," *PRO* meaning that returns are likely *-1 to decline as the volume of junk - bond financings shrinks.
In a leveraged buy - out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed * largely by borrowing, with the expectation that the debt will be paid *-1 with funds generated * by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets.
In a recent report, Moody's said 0 it "expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry, which *T*-1, combined with overcapacity, will create poor prospects for profitability."
It said that the "temptation *ICH*-2 for managements *PRO* to ease this profit pressure by *PRO*-1 taking greater risks is an additional rating factor."
Both Moody's and S&P cited First Boston's reliance in recent years on merchant banking, which *T*-1 has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm's profit.
The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $3 billion *U* of high - yield, high - risk junk financings for Campeau units.
In addition, a big loan that First Boston made *T*-2 to Ohio Mattress Co . wasn't repaid *-4 on time when its $450 million *U* junk financing for a buy - out of the bedding company was withdrawn *-1 *T*-3.
"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said *T*-1.
"Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity."
CS First Boston, however, benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder, Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third largest bank.
Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy - out business.
But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail, or individual investor, business showed no signs of *PRO* rebounding from the slump that *T*-1 followed the October 1987 stock market crash.
In addition, Shearson's listed $2 billion *U* of capital is overstated *-1, according to the rating concerns, because it includes $1.7 billion *U* of goodwill.
Shearson "really only has $300 million *U* of capital," says *T*-1 Mr. Bowman of S&P.
A Shearson spokesman said 0 the firm isn't worried.
"A year ago, Moody's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade," he said *T*-1.
"After two months of talks, our rating was maintained *-1."
Drexel, meanwhile, already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating.
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel, the leading underwriter in that market.
The firm also has been hit *-1 with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related * to a big insider - trading scandal.
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business, *PRO*-1 cutting the firm's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000.
Recently, Drexel circulated a private financial statement *ICH*-1 among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years.
The firm's capital, moreover, hasn't grown at the same rate as in the past, officials at these firms say 0 *T*-1.
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness.
"We're well positioned *-2 with $1.7 billion *U* of capital," a Drexel spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
"And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm, the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view.
Moreover, we've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in *PRO* reducing costs, which *T*-1 are down around 40% over the last six months.
American City Business Journals Inc. said 0 its president, Michael K. Russell, will resign rather than relocate to new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Russell, who *T*-1 co-founded the Kansas City, Mo. - based local business publications concern here, said 0 he would have a five - year consulting agreement with the company, which *T*-2 recently underwent an ownership change.
Earlier this year Shaw Publishing Inc., Charlotte, acquired 30% of American City *T*-1 and has an agreement *PRO* to acquire a further 25% from E.W. Scripps Co. next year.
Ray Shaw, chairman of American City, said 0 he would assume Mr. Russell's responsibilities if a successor isn't found *-1 this month.
Olympia Broadcasting Corp. said 0 it didn't make a $1.64 million *U* semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $23.4 million *U* of senior subordinated debentures.
The radio - station owner and programmer said 0 it was trying *PRO*-1 to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions.
It said 0 it needs *-1 to make the payment by Dec. 1 *PRO*-1 to avoid a default that *T*-2 could lead to an acceleration of the debt.
In September, the company said 0 it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order *PRO*-1 to concentrate on its programming business.
The parent of Younkers, after *PRO*-1 failing *PRO* to find a buyer for the chain of Midwestern department stores, said 0 it will sell a stake in the chain to management and take other steps *PRO*-2 to reduce its investment in retailing.
Equitable of Iowa Cos., Des Moines, had been seeking a buyer for the 36 - store Younkers chain since June, when it announced its intention *PRO* to free up capital *PRO* to expand its insurance business *T*-1.
But Equitable said 0 it was unable *PRO*-1 to find a buyer willing *PRO* to pay what it considers *T*-2 "fair value" for Younkers because of recent turmoil in the bond and stock markets and in retailing.
Younkers rang up sales *ICH*-1 in 1988 of $313 million *U*.
It operates stores mostly in Iowa and Nebraska.
Younkers management is likely *-1 to buy a 10% to 20% *U* interest in the chain in January, said 0 *T*-2 Fred S. Hubbell, Equitable's president and chief executive officer.
He said 0 Equitable hopes *PRO*-1 to eventually reduce its stake in Younkers to less than 50%.
The Bush administration's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a "qualified" rating, rather than "well qualified *T*-1."
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which *T*-1 will vote on the nomination, said 0 some liberal members of the panel are likely *-2 to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter.
Mr. Thomas, currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court.
Groups have accused him of *PRO* advocating policies that *T*-1 narrowed rights of older workers and of *PRO* ignoring discrimination by large companies.
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said 0 they oppose Mr. Thomas's nomination because of "serious questions about his judgment {and} respect for the law."
A senior Justice Department official, however, said 0 the administration isn't worried about the ABA rating.
"We're pleased 0 the ABA rated him *PRO*-2 qualified," David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman, said *T*-1 in an interview.
The ABA gives a "qualified" rating to nominees 0 it believes 0 *T*-1 would perform "satisfactorily" on the bench.
In contrast, the lawyers' association gives a "well qualified" rating to those "regarded * as one of the best available for the vacancy.

World sugar futures prices soared on rumors that Brazil, a major grower and exporter, might not ship sugar this crop year and next.
Prices also were boosted *-1 by another rumor that Mexico, usually a large producer and exporter, might have *-2 to buy a large quantity of sugar.
Although traders rushed *PRO*-3 to buy futures contracts, many remained skeptical about the Brazilian development, which *T*-4 couldn't be confirmed *-1, analysts said 0 *T*-2.
The March and May contracts rose to fresh life - of - contract highs of 14.54 cents and 14.28 cents at their best levels of the day.
The March delivery, which *T*-1 has no limits, settled at 14.53 cents, up 0.56 cent a pound.
The May contract, which *T*-1 also is without restraints, ended with a gain of 0.54 cent to 14.26 cents.
The July delivery rose its daily permissible limit of 0.50 cent a pound to 14.00 cents, while other contract months showed near - limit advances.
According to reports carried * by various news services, the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won't be allowed *PRO*-1 to export sugar during the current 1989 - 90 season, which *T*-92 began May 1, and the 1990 - 91 season so that it can be used *-2 *PRO* to produce alcohol for automobile fuel.
One analyst, Arthur Stevenson, of Prudential - Bache Securities, New York, estimated that 65% or more of Brazil's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline.
"This is a demand that *T*-3 must be met *-1, regardless of the price of oil," said *T*-2 Mr. Stevenson.
Brazil is the third - largest producer *RNR*-1 and the fifth - largest exporter *RNR*-1 of sugar in the world.
A shift to *PRO* producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected *-1, but the latest news, if true, indicates a more drastic shift 0 than *T*-2 had been anticipated *-3.
During the current crop year, Brazil was expected *-1 to produce 6.9 million tons of sugar, a drop from 8.1 million tons in 1988 - 89.
Its 1989 - 90 exports were expected *-1 to total 645,000 tons in contrast to shipments of 1.5 million tons in
"It is these 645,000 tons that *T*-1 are in question for this crop year," explained *T*-2 Judith Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New York.
"Producers were granted *-2 the right *ICH*-1 earlier this year *PRO* to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected *-4 to have begun *PRO*-5 to be issued *-3" yesterday.
As a result, Ms. Ganes said 0 *?*, it is believed that little or no sugar from the 1989 - 90 crop has been shipped *-1 yet, even though the crop year is six months old.
More than a half of all sugar produced * in Brazil goes for alcohol production, according to Ms. Ganes.
Also, there has been a switch *ICH*-3 in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that *T*-5 were previously used *-1 for cane, and this change is being felt *-4 now, she said 0 *T*-2.
Most important, Ms. Ganes noted 0 *?*, "Brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made *-1 on the suspension of exports."
Thomas Oxnard, sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack, N.J., said: "I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports, particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound."
Above all, Mr. Oxnard noted 0 *?*, the situation is extremely confused.
"Professional sugar people here who *T*-1 have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable *PRO*-3 to confirm the reports or get enough information 0 *PRO* to clarify the situation *T*-4," he said *T*-2.
"It's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report *ICH*-1 can be put out *-6 *T*-2, such as the one saying 0 exports will be suspended *-7, and no one can confirm it."
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated.
On the one hand, Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago *PRO*-1 to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program.
"It has *-1 to weigh, on the other hand, the relatively high price of sugar 0 it can earn *T*-3 on the export market in *PRO* making decisions as to whether *PRO* to produce sugar or alcohol," Mr. Oxnard said *T*-2.
Mexico, which *T*-1 is normally a sugar exporter, has had production problems in the past two years, analysts said 0 *T*-2.
Last year, it had *-1 to buy sugar on the world market *PRO*-2 to meet export commitments, they noted 0 *T*-3.
This year it is expected *-1 to be a net importer and is said *-1 to be seeking *PRO*-2 to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar *PRO*-3 to meet internal needs, analysts said 0 *T*-4.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
ENERGY:
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents *PRO*-1 to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon.
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged.
But the strength in heating oil helped *PRO*-1 push up crude oil.
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel *PRO*-1 to settle at $20.07 *U*.
The firmness in heating oil was attributed *-1 to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute, which *T*-2 showed a decline in inventories of the fuel.
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:
Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued *-1 to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices 0 *T*-2 to come.
Trading was muted *-1 in part because of the observance of All Saints' Day across much of Europe.
Continued export demand also supported prices.
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S., market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government, which *T*-1 often buys U.S. grains in quantity, turned instead to Britain *PRO*-2 to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat.
Traders said 0 prices also were supported *-1 by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of *PRO* receiving most favored nation status from the U.S. .
That designation would, among other things, provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain *T*-1.
The Soviets are widely believed *-1 to need additional supplies, despite *PRO* running up record one - month purchases of 310 million bushels of corn in October.
COPPER:
Futures prices rose, *PRO*-1 extending Tuesday's gains.
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $1.1650 *U*.
Buying for the most part carried over from the previous session, and traders apparently ignored reports that a Chilean mine strike may have ended almost before it began, an analyst said 0 *T*-1.
According to news service reports, most workers at the Disputado mines owned * by Exxon Corp. agreed to a new two - year wage contract that *T*-1 includes a 5% increase and other benefits.
However, some workers haven't yet accepted the new contract and are continuing negotiations, the analyst said 0 *T*-1.
Separately, Reuter reported that the Papua - New Guinea government urged its Parliament *PRO*-1 to extend a state of emergency in copper - rich Bougainville Island for two months.
The Bougainville copper mine has been inoperative since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners who *T*-1 want Bougainville to secede from Papua - New Guinea.
Your Oct. 6 editorial "The Ill Homeless" referred to research by us and six of our colleagues that *T*-1 was reported *-17 in the Sept. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Your comments implied 0 we had discovered that the "principal cause" of homelessness is *-1 to be found *-18 in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance - abusing people in the homeless population.
We have made no such statement.
It *EXP*-1 is clear that most mentally ill people and most alcoholics do not become homeless.
The "causes" of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case.
In *PRO* quoting from our research you emphasized the high prevalance of mental illness and alcoholism.
You did not note that the homeless people 0 we examined *T*-1 had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse.
They suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases and the aftereffects of assaults and rape.
Homeless people not only lack safety, privacy and shelter, they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition, cleanliness and basic health care.
In a recent report, the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness, others may be a consequence of it, and a third category is composed *-19 of disorders whose treatment *T*-15 is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter.
The interactions between health and homelessness are complex, *PRO*-1 defying sweeping generalizations as to "cause" or "effect."
If we look to the future, *PRO* preventing homelessness is an important objective.
This will require us *PRO*-21 to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess *?*, an understanding that *T*-1 can be developed *-20 only through careful study and research.

A study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says 0 homelessness is due to a complex array of problems, with the common thread of poverty.
The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up *-21 of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems.
According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is "simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created * by the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level."
Leighton E. Cluff M.D. President Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Princeton, N.J.
*PRO* To quote the highly regarded director of a privately funded drop - in center for the homeless in New York: "If you're homeless, you don't sleep for fear of *PRO* being robbed or murdered *-1.
After your first three weeks of sleep deprivation, you're scarcely in touch with reality any more; without psychiatric treatment, you may well be unable *PRO*-1 to fend for yourself ever again."
Some of the homeless, obviously, had pre-existing mental illness or addiction.
But many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets.
Once there, what ways of escape *ICH*-2 are *T*-1 open to them other than drink, drugs or insanity?
Maxwell R.D. Vos Brooklyn, N.Y.
You dismiss as "sentimental" the view that the reduction of federal housing - assistance programs by 77% might have played a significant role in the increased number of men and women sleeping on our city streets during the Reagan - Bush years.
There is no sign that you bothered *PRO*-1 to consider the inverse of your logic: namely, that mental illness and substance abuse might be to some degree consequences rather than causes of homelessness.
Your research stopped when a convenient assertion could be made *-22 *T*-1.
Robert S. Jenkins Cambridge, Mass.
Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose *PRO*-1 to cite such groups as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, *PRO*-1 insinuating that the march got its major support from self - serving groups that "*T*-2 know a good thing when they see it *T*-3," and that the crusade was based *-23 on greed or the profit motive.
But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who *T*-16 subscribe to *RNR*-1, and advertise in *RNR*-1, your paper?
Why didn't you mention the YMCA or the YWCA or Catholic Charities USA or a hundred other nonprofit organizations that *T*-17 participated in the march *T*-1?
As for the findings on the 203 Baltimore homeless who *T*-18 underwent psychiatric examinations, I suggest 0 you conduct your own survey.
*PRO* Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and *PRO* put them out on the streets, *PRO*-1 to be deprived *-24 for one month of their homes, families and income.
I would predict that within a short time most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal and that their "normal" phobias, anxieties, depressions and substance abuse would increase dramatically.

Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership, an investment firm, completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co.'s Caldor discount chain for $500 million *U* plus the assumption of $52 million *U* in debt.
Caldor, based * in Norwalk, Conn., operates 118 stores in the Northeast; it reported revenue of $1.6 billion *U* last year.
May Stores, St. Louis, runs such well - known department stores as Lord & Taylor.
Lewis C. Veraldi, the father of the team that *T*-1 created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, retired early after *PRO*-2 experiencing recent heart problems.
Most recently, Mr. Veraldi, 59 years old, has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.
But he is best known *-3 in the auto industry as the creator of a team car - development approach that *T*-1 produced the two midsized cars that *T*-2 were instrumental in *PRO* helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in *PRO* enabling the company's Ford division *PRO*-4 to eclipse General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division as the top - selling nameplate in the U.S. .
Under the so - called Team Taurus approach, Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers, assembly - line workers, auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle.
The concept's goal was *PRO* to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford's product development more responsive to consumer demands.
It was later applied *-2 to other new - car programs, including those that *T*-1 produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has "helped *PRO*-1 to change the world's perception of American - made cars."
Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years, *PRO*-1 holding a variety of car and parts - engineering positions.
Two leading constitutional - law experts said 0 President Bush doesn't have the legal authority *PRO* to exercise a line - item veto.
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said 0 any effort by President Bush 0 *PRO* to claim authority for a line - item veto *T*-1 would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents.
A line - item veto is a procedure that *T*-1 would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without *PRO*-2 having *-3 to scuttle the entire measure.
Mr. Bush has said 0 he would like *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to use this procedure.
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering *PRO*-1 declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line - item veto *PRO*-2 to provoke a test case.
But the two legal experts, responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a joint letter that the president "lacks the constitutional authority *PRO* to exercise a line - item veto."
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum--Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal.
The two professors said 0 the Constitution authorizes the president *PRO*-1 to veto entire bills, not partial measures.
Moreover, they said 0 the first appropriations bill passed * 200 years ago covered many different items, and there was no discussion of a line - item veto.
They also said that more than a dozen presidents *PPA*-1 have called for line - item veto authority since the Civil War, and "all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach" of the president.
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation 0 *PRO* to give the president line - item veto power *T*-2, but that it *EXP*-1 would be a "reckless course of action" for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval.
After years of struggling, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today, *PRO*-1 shut down by its parent, Hearst Corp., following unsuccessful efforts *PRO* to sell the venerable newspaper.
The demise of the 238,000 - circulation Herald, once the nation's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000, turns the country's second - largest city into a one - newspaper town, at least in some senses.
The Los Angeles Times, with a circulation of more than 1.1 million, dominates the region.
But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register, which *T*-44 sells more than 300,000 copies a day, and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News, which *T*-45 sells more than 170,000.
Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies.
In July, closely held Hearst, based * in New York, put the paper on the block.
Speculation had it that the company was asking $100 million *U* for an operation said *PRO* to be losing about $20 million *U* a year, but others said 0 Hearst might have virtually given the paper away.
An attempted buy - out led * by John J. McCabe, chief operating officer, never materialized, and a stream of what one staff member dismissed *T*-1 as "tire - kickers and lookee - loos" had filed through since.
The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun.
The death of the Herald, a newsstand paper in a freeway town, was perhaps inevitable.
Los Angeles is a sprawling, balkanized newspaper market, and advertisers seemed *-1 to feel 0 they could buy space in the mammoth Times, then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies.
The Herald was left *-61 in limbo.
Further, the Herald seemed *-1 torn *ICH*-4 editorially between *PRO*-3 keeping its old - time Hearst readership--blue - collar and sports - oriented--and trying *PRO*-2 to provide a sprightly, upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times.
Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan.
The Herald joins the Baltimore News - American, which *T*-46 folded, and the Boston Herald - American, which *T*-1 was sold *-62, as cornerstones of the old Hearst newspaper empire abandoned * by the company in the 1980s.
Many felt 0 Hearst kept the paper *PRO*-1 alive as long as it did, if marginally, because of its place in family history.
Its fanciful offices were designed *-63 by architect Julia Morgan, who *T*-47 built the Hearst castle at San Simeon.
William Randolph Hearst had kept an apartment in the Spanish Renaissance - style building.
Analysts said 0 the Herald's demise doesn't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry.
"The Herald was a survivor from a bygone age," said *T*-1 J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
"Actually, the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of *PRO* coming to an end, and the industry looks pretty healthy."
*PRO*-64 Founded as the Examiner in 1903 by Mr. Hearst, the Herald was crippled *-64 by a bitter, decade - long strike that *T*-1 began in 1967 and cut circulation in half.
Financially, it never recovered; editorially, it had its moments.
In 1979, Hearst hired editor James Bellows, who *T*-48 brightened the editorial product considerably.
He and his successor, Mary Anne Dolan, restored respect for the editorial product, and though in recent years the paper had been limping along on limited resources, its accomplishments were notable.
For example, the Herald consistently beat its much - larger rival on disclosures about Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's financial dealings.
The Herald's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded.
Robert J. Danzig, vice president *RNR*-1 and general manager *RNR*-1 of Hearst Newspapers, stood up in the paper's newsroom yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would fold, *PRO*-2 putting more than 730 full - time employees out of work.
Hearst said 0 it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for 60 days.
Some long - tenured employees will receive additional benefits, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Hours after the announcement, representatives of the Orange County Register were in a bar across the street *PRO*-1 recruiting.
The reaction in the newsroom was emotional.
"I've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time," said *T*-1 Bill Johnson, an assistant city editor.
"So Long, L.A." was chosen *-1 as the paper's final headline.
"I'm doing the main story, and I'm already two beers drunk," said *T*-1 reporter Andy Furillo, whom the Times hired *T*-50 away several years ago but who *T*-49 returned to the Herald out of preference.
His wife also works for the paper, as did his father.
Outside, a young pressman filling a news box with an extra edition headlined * "Herald Examiner Closes" refused *PRO*-1 to take a reader's quarter.
"*PRO* Forget it," he said *T*-1 as he handed her a paper.
"It doesn't make any difference now.

The limits to legal absurdity stretched another notch this week when the Supreme Court refused *PRO*-2 to hear an appeal from a case that *T*-1 says 0 corporate defendants must pay damages even after *PRO*-3 proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm *T*-4.
We can understand and share the compassion that *T*-2 makes judges sometimes wish *PRO*-3 to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who *T*-4've been hurt *-1.
But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy - making process have left the courts as the only forum 0 this country has *T*-2 0 *PRO* to debate risk, technology and innovation *T*-3 *T*-1.
Too often now, a single court decision becomes the precedent for other, less compelling cases.
From the 1940s until 1971, some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES) *PRO*-1 to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness.
The drug was approved *-1 by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed *-1 by some 300 pharmaceutical companies, often under generic labels.
In the 1970s, scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users.
The cases quickly went to court, but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs couldn't recall whose brand they used *T*-1.
*PRO* Beginning in 1980, courts in several states including California and New York decided *PRO*-2 to suspend the common - law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who *T*-1 are liable.
Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same, and created a market - share test so that damages would be assessed *-1 against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales.
This has some logic.
Drug makers shouldn't be able *PRO*-2 to duck liability because people couldn't identify precisely which identical drug *T*-3 was used *-1.
But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope.
Just as all plaintiffs are not alike, it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties.
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v. Lilly, where the highest New York court expanded the market - share approach for the first time *PRO* to say that drug makers that *T*-1 could prove 0 Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages *T*-2.
But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes, by this reasoning a defendant could be held *-1 liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California.
Despite the Supreme Court's refusal *PRO* to hear the case, there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants.
The big problem, however, is that there's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited *-1 to DES or to drugs.
The problem here goes well beyond *PRO* twisting legal doctrine.
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction *PRO*-1 to make it *EXP*-2 much harder *PRO* to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs *T*-3.
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs, *PRO*-1 citing the huge, hidden social costs.
"Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs, even though some risks, perhaps serious ones, might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering," the unanimous court said *T*-1.
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning - sickness drug, Bendectin, off the U.S. market.
This raises the key issue: What *PRO* to do *T*-2 about people who *T*-1 suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?
We now know that *PRO* holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks *T*-1 only means 0 the drugs won't be available to anyone.
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us, after the Hymowitz case, if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug "it's time 0 *PRO* to sell that company's stock short *T*-1."
We also know that the tort system is a lousy way 0 *PRO* to compensate victims *T*-1 anyway; some win the legal lottery, others get much less and contingency - fee lawyers take a big cut either way.
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken *-1 out of the courts.
Congress could create a compensation program 0 *T*-1 to help such victims while *PRO*-2 protecting the national interest in *PRO* encouraging new drugs.
But a 1986 law that *T*-1 supposedly replaced lawsuits over children's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation.
Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of *PRO* writing legislation 0 *PRO* to help deserving people *T*-1 without its becoming some billion - dollar morass.
We have no doubt 0 this is one reason 0 judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing *PRO*-1 to trash the law in the DES cases.
They must figure that justice has *-2 to get done *-3 by somebody, but know 0 it won't be done *-1 by Congress.
The British Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation of the competitive impact of Michelin Tyre PLC's planned acquisition of National Tyre Service Ltd.
The department said 0 it referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of the purchase's possible effects on the U.K. market for distribution of replacement tires.
BTR PLC, a U.K. industrial conglomerate, said in June 0 it had sold its National Tyre Service business to Michelin Investment Ltd., a U.K. unit of the tire maker, for #140 million *U* ($221.4 million *U*).
Michelin Tyre is a unit of France's Michelin S.A.
Michelin officials couldn't immediately comment on the referral, but they noted 0 the purchase from BTR has already been concluded *-1.
National Tyre, which *T*-1 has 420 branches throughout the U.K., had 1988 pretax profit of #8.5 million *U*.
Metallgesellschaft AG said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire 51% of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Metallgesellschaft, a diversified Frankfurt, West Germany - based metals group, said 0 it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company *PRO*-1 to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants.
Lentjes' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit, the company said 0 *T*-1.
The move is part of a strategy 0 *T*-3 to focus on its core metals trading, processing and plant engineering activities while *PRO*-1 shedding peripheral units, the company said 0 *T*-2.
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks ($434.4 million *U*) and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks.
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock.
A plan *PRO* to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset *-1 by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices.
If you'd really rather have a Buick, *PRO* don't leave home without the American Express card.
Or so the slogan might go.
American Express Co. and General Motors Corp.'s beleaguered Buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed * at *PRO* boosting Buick's sales while *PRO* encouraging broader use of the American Express card.
The companies are giving four - day vacations for two to Buick buyers who *T*-51 charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card.
They have begun *-1 sending letters explaining the program, which *T*-52 began Oct. 18 and will end Dec. 18, to about five million card holders.
Neither company would disclose the program's cost.
Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a "good credit history" and are "good at *PRO* making payments," says *T*-1 a spokeswoman for the division.
American Express also represents the upscale image 0 "we're trying *PRO*-2 to project *T*-1," she adds *T*-3.
Buick has been seeking for the past few years *PRO*-1 to restore its reputation as "the doctor's car"--a product for upscale professionals.
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier, though industry sales fell.
But since the 1990 model year began Oct. 1, Buick sales have plunged 33%.
For American Express, the promotion is part of an effort *PRO* to broaden the use of its card for retail sales, where the company expects *PRO*-2 to get much of the future growth in its card business *T*-1.
Traditionally, the card has been used *-66 mainly for travel and entertainment expenses.
Phillip Riese, an American Express executive vice president, says 0 the promotion with Buick is his company's first with an auto maker, but "hopefully {will be} the first of many" in the company's effort *PRO* to promote its green card as "the total car - care card."
To that end, American Express has been signing up gasoline companies, car repair shops, tire companies and car dealers *PRO*-1 to accept the card.
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card, but few card holders realize this, Mr. Riese says 0 *T*-1.
Until now, however, buyers who *T*-53 wanted *PRO*-1 to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth - in - lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates, says *T*-2 a spokesman for the GM finance arm.
But GMAC approved the Buick program, he says 0 *?*, because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing, and so doesn't carry any finance rates.
Mr. Riese says 0 American Express considers GM and Buick "very sophisticated direct - mail marketers," so "by *PRO*-1 joining forces with them we have managed *PRO*-1 to maximize our direct - mail capability."
In addition, Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders, says 0 *T*-1 an American Express spokeswoman.
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like *PRO*-3 to get information about *T*-2 for possible future purchases *T*-1, Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars, the spokeswoman says 0 *T*-4.
American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S., and over half have the green card.
GMAC screened the card - member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $45,000 *U* who *T*-54 hadn't "missed any payments," the Buick spokeswoman says 0 *T*-1.
Some 3.8 million of the five million who *T*-55 will get letters were preapproved *-67 for credit with GMAC.
These 3.8 million people also are eligible *PRO*-1 to get one percentage point off GMAC's advertised finance rates, which *T*-56 start at 6.9% for two - year loan contracts.
A spokesman for Visa International's U.S. subsidiary says 0 his company is using promotions *PRO*-1 to increase use of its cards, but doesn't have plans for a tie - in similar to the American Express - Buick link.
Three divisions at American Express *ICH*-1 are working with Buick on the promotion: the establishment services division, which *T*-57 is responsible for all merchants and companies that *T*-2 accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division.
The vacation packages include hotel accommodations and, in some cases, tours or tickets to local attractions, but not meals.
Destinations are Chicago; Honolulu; Las Vegas, Nev.; Los Angeles; Miami Beach, Fla.; New Orleans; New York; Orlando, Fla.; San Francisco; and Washington, D.C.
A buyer who *T*-58 chooses *PRO*-1 to fly to his destination must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion's ticket free if they fly on United Airlines.
In lieu of the vacation, buyers can choose among several prizes, including a grandfather clock or a stereo videocassette recorder.
Card holders who *T*-59 receive the letter also are eligible for a sweepstakes with Buick cars or a Hawaii vacation as prizes.
If they test - drive a Buick, they get an American Express calculator.
This isn't Buick's first travel - related promotion.
A few years ago, the company offered two round - trip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car.
The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division's forecast by more than 10%, Buick said 0 *T*-1 at the time.
Leon J. Level, vice president and chief financial officer of this computer services concern, and F. Warren McFarlan, a professor at Harvard University's Graduate School of Business, were elected *-1 *PRO*-2 directors, *PRO* increasing board membership to nine.
"Feeding Frenzy" (Henry Holt, 326 pages, $19.95 *U*), a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal, begins on a reassuring note.
Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity.
When *PRO*-4 offered *-3 a free trip from the Bronx, Wedtech's home, to Washington, D.C., by one of Wedtech's principals *T*-2, he tells the reader, "*PRO*-5 mindful of *PRO* accepting anything of value from those 0 I was writing about *T*-1, I declined."
Any question as to why an author would believe 0 this plaintive, high - minded note of assurance is necessary *T*-2 is answered *-1 by *PRO* reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers.
Bribe by bribe, Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path 0 Wedtech traveled *T*-1, from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full - fledged defense contractor, entrusted * with the task of *PRO* producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy.
The book revolves around John Mariotta, the founder of the company, and Fred Neuberger, who *T*-1 became his partner soon after Wedtech's creation.
Although *PRO*-1 started in 1965, Wedtech didn't really get *PRO*-1 rolling until 1975, when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government's Section 8 (A) minority business program *T*-2.
This is a Johnson - era, Great Society creation that *T*-2 mandates 0 certain government contracts be awarded *-1 noncompetitively to minority businesses.
Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born *-1 in Puerto Rico.
The two partners merely had *-1 to falsify the true ownership of the corporation.
Instead of 50 / 50 it became, on paper only, two - thirds Mariotta, one - third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races.
Besides *PRO*-1 being a "minority - owned company" Wedtech was located *-1 in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made *PRO* famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign.
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about *PRO* rebuilding the South Bronx and kept *PRO*-1 using the minority--South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s.
*PRO*-1 Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi (now serving a jail sentence), the company began a career of *PRO* bribing federal, state and local public officials and those close to public officials, right up to *RNR*-2 and including *RNR*-2 E. Robert Wallach, close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese.
Wedtech didn't just use old fashioned bribery.
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling, *PRO*-1 retaining politically connected "respectable" law firms, investment bankers and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger.
When necessary *T*-1, it sought and received assistance from organized crime.
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company.
Wedtech management used the merit system.
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity.
If you were not an effective crook, you found yourself out in the cold, a fate that *T*-1 eventually befell Mr. Mariotta, the firm's semiliterate "minority" person.
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy, easy - 0 *PRO* to - read *T*-1 tabloid writing style, "Feeding Frenzy" often falls short of gripping reading.
None of the scams show much ingenuity: Auditors found crookery the first day on the job.
Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them *PRO*-1 to shut up.
The scammers themselves were garden - variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who *T*-1 wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes.
Among the lot of them, not one is wrestling with good and evil, or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane.
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who *T*-1 changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack.
He enters the story toward the end, just in time 0 *PRO* to get *PRO*-1 arrested *-1 *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Absorbed in *PRO* doling out "Feeding Frenzy's" tidbits, the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech, namely the Section 8 (A) federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place *T*-2.
They do at least come around to *PRO* saying that the courts might want *PRO*-1 to end "rigid affirmative action programs."
Programs like Section 8 (A) are a little like *PRO* leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by *PRO*-2 to scoop it up *T*-1.
Numerous other scandals, among them the ones at HUD, have the same characteristics as Wedtech.
They take place in government programs that *T*-1 seem *-2 tailor - made for corruption.
Why are programs like this not eliminated *-2 *T*-1?
"Feeding Frenzy" does provide a few clues.
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are *T*-3 groups of people who *T*-2 can best be described *-1 as *PRO*-4 belonging to a political insider commercial party.
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment *T*-2, there is big money 0 *T*-3 to be made *-1 in *PRO* influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.
They are our version of the East bloc's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish *PRO* to see anything change.
How many government programs and policies *T*-1 exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?
This is the real issue raised * by the Wedtech scandal.
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp., 1983 - 85.
Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said 0 it was awarded *-4 U.S. patents for Interleukin - 3 and bone morphogenetic protein.
The patent for Interleukin - 3 covers materials and methods used * *PRO* to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology.
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin - 3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it.
Interleukin - 3 may help in *PRO* treating blood cell deficiencies associated * with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplants and other blood - cell disorders, Genetics Institute said 0 *T*-1.
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein - 1, a substance that *T*-2 can induce formation of new cartilage.
The patent covers BMP - 1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for *PRO* treating bone or cartilage defects, Genetics Institute said 0 *T*-1.
The company added that it has filed patent applications "on a large number of different BMP proteins" and the patent on BMP - 1 is the first 0 it has received *T*-1.
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in *PRO* treating bone loss associated * with periodontal disease and certain cancers, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Follow - up report:
You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting *T*-1 to those 130 million people around the world who *T*-20 tune in to it each week.
You can even take notes--extensive notes, for the Voice folks won't look over your shoulder--about what you read *T*-1.
You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress.
And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts.
Until the other day, you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right *PRO* to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world *T*-21.
That was the law.
And I apparently had no right *PRO* to print hither what the Voice was booming *T*-2 to yon.
It was censorship.
It was outrageous.
And it was stupid.
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government shouldn't propagandize its own people.
That sounds neat, but this government--any government--propagandizes its own people every day.
Government press releases, speeches, briefings, tours of military facilities, publications are all propaganda of sorts.
Propaganda is just information 0 *T*-1 to support a viewpoint, and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you *PRO*-2 to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue.
The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd: An agency in the information business was not being allowed *PRO*-1 to inform.
In June 1988, I wrote in this space about this issue.
*PRO*-1 Assuming 0 it wasn't one of those columns that you clipped *T*-2 and put *T*-2 on the refrigerator door, I'll review the facts.
The Voice of America is a government agency that *T*-1 broadcasts news and views--some might say propaganda--in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world.
It does a first - rate job.
Its budget $184 million *U*--is paid for *-30 by you.
But a 1948 law barred the "dissemination" of that material in the U.S. .
The law let scholars, reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material, only at VOA headquarters in Washington, but it barred them from *PRO*-1 copying texts.
And, of course, there's that word "dissemination."
How's that *T*-1 again?
"You may come by the agency *PRO*-3 to read but not copy either manually or by *PRO* photocopying," a Voice official explained *T*-1 when I asked *T*-2.
What if I tune in my short - wave radio, transcribe an editorial or program, and print it in my newspaper?
"Nor are you free *PRO*-2 to reprint such material," I was advised *-31 *T*-1.
That sounded a lot like censorship, so after years of letters and conversations that *T*-22 went nowhere, I sued.
A couple of weeks ago, I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines.
At least, that's the way 0 it was reported *-32 *T*-1.
And, indeed, the lawsuit was dismissed *-33.
But I--I like *PRO*-1 to think of it in terms of we, all of us--won the point.
For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling: The United States Information Agency, which *T*-23 runs the Voice, changed its position on three key points.
-- The USIA said that, on reflection, of course I could print anything 0 I could get my hands on *T*-1.
The word dissemination, it decided 0 *?*, referred only to itself.
"The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right *ICH*-2 of everyone except the USIA *PRO* to disseminate agency program materials in the United States," my lawyer, the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines, said *T*-1 in a memo pointing out the facts and trying *PRO* to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost.
The court noted the new USIA position but, just in case, officially found "that Congress did not intend *PRO*-1 to preclude plaintiffs from *PRO* disseminating USIA information domestically."
-- The USIA said that, on reflection, anyone *ICH*-2 could view the VOA materials, not just the reporters, scholars, researchers and congressmen who *T*-1 are mentioned *-34 in the statute.
"The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed *-35 access to the materials, notwithstanding the statutory designations, because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting *PRO* to see the materials," Mr. McCormick noted *T*-2.
-- And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes.
"The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who *T*-24 examine the materials may make notes and, while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes, no one will check *PRO*-3 to determine what notes a person has taken *T*-25," Mr. McCormick reported *T*-1.
I had sought, in my suit, the right *PRO* to print Voice material, which *T*-2 had been denied me *-36, and I had sought a right *PRO* to receive the information, *PRO*-3 arguing in effect that a right *PRO* to print government information isn't very helpful if I have no right *PRO* to get the information.
But the court disagreed.
"The First Amendment proscribes the government from *PRO*-2 passing laws abridging the right to free speech," Judge Donald O'Brien ruled *T*-1.
"The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government *PRO* to assure easy access to information for members of the press."
So now the situation is this:
You have a right *PRO*-2 to read Voice of America scripts if you don't mind *PRO*-1 traveling to Washington every week or so and *PRO*-1 visiting the Voice office during business hours.
I have a right *PRO*-1 to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously--but no longer surreptitiously--copy them out in long hand.
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent *-1 to us.
In an era when every government agency has a public - relations machine that *T*-2 sends you stuff whether you want it or not *T*-1, this does seem *-3 odd.
Indeed, Judge O'Brien ruled that "it *EXP*-1 would be easy *PRO* to conclude that the USIA's position is ` inappropriate or even stupid,"' but it's the law.
So the next step, I suspect 0 *?*, is *PRO* to try *PRO*-2 to get the law changed.
We (I assume 0 you're in this with me at this point) need *-1 to get three words--"for examination only"--eliminated from the law.
Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says 0 Voice material shall be available to certain of us (but now, thanks to the USIA's new position, all of us) "for examination only."
If those words weren't there, the nice people at the Voice would be able *PRO*-1 to send you the information or, at the very least, let you photocopy it.
This is not a trivial issue.
"You have...raised important questions which *T*-26 ought *PRO*-2 to be answered *-3: What does USIA say *T*-27 about America abroad; how do we say it *T*-4; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions *T*-5?" a man wrote me *T*-1 a couple of years ago.
The man was Charles Z. Wick.
At the time, he was director of the
He had no answers then.
Now there are some.
This democracy is suddenly a little more democratic.
I feel pretty good about it.

INTER - TEL Inc . (Chandler, Ariz.) --
Jerry Chapman, managing director of WayMar Associates, was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern.
He increases the board to seven.
Researchers at American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories reported 0 they raised the electrical current - carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of 100, *PRO*-1 moving the materials closer to commercial use.
The scientists said 0 they created small changes in the crystal - lattice structures of the superconductors *PRO*-2 to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry *T*-1 to 600,000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field.
The scientists said 0 they made the advance with yttrium - containing superconductors cooled * to liquid - nitrogen temperature, or minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit.
Their report appears in today's issue of the journal Nature.
The finding marks a significant step in research on "bulk" superconductors, which *T*-2 are aimed *-1 at use in wires for motors, magnets, generators and other applications.
Scientists had obtained even higher current - carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors, but have had problems *PRO*-2 increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry *T*-1.
Superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when *PRO*-3 cooled *-2 *T*-1.
A family of ceramic superconductors discovered * during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation--but only if their current - carrying capacity can be raised *-1.
The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the current - carrying problem can be overcome *-1 *T*-2.
But "it won't lead to imminent use" of new superconductors, cautioned 0 *T*-1 Robert B. van Dover, one of the AT&T researchers.
He added that the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so - called weak links between crystals.
Such multi-crystal materials will probably be needed *-1 for commercial applications.
Mr. van Dover said 0 the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by *PRO*-2 bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons, a process that *T*-1 creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for large - scale commercial use.
Still, scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding, because it demonstrates how *PRO* to overcome the "flux pinning" problem that *T*-1 earlier this year was widely publicized *-3 as *PRO* undercutting new superconductors' potential *T*-2.
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals, *PRO* limiting their current - carrying capacity.
Mr. van Dover said 0 the crystal changes 0 his team introduced *T*-1 apparently pins the magnetic fields in place, *PRO* preventing them from *PRO*-3 lowering current - carrying capacity.
Mr. van Dover added that researchers are trying *PRO*-2 to determine precisely what crystal changes *T*-1 solved the problem.
*PRO* Determining that may enable them *PRO*-2 to develop better ways 0 *PRO* to introduce the needed crystal - lattice patterns *T*-1.
The AT&T team also is trying *PRO*-1 to combine their latest superconductor process with "melt - textured growth," a process discovered * earlier at Bell Laboratories.
The combined processes may significantly raise the current - carrying capacity of multi-crystal samples.
NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software 0 *PRO* to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers *T*-1.
The new software is based *-1 on Novell Inc.'s NetWare network operating system software.
Rep. John Dingell, an important sponsor of President Bush's clean - air bill, plans *PRO*-2 to unveil a surprise proposal that *T*-1 would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue: acid rain.
The Michigan Democrat's proposal, which *T*-4 is expected *-2 today, is described *-1 by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration's plan *PRO* to cut utility emissions that *T*-3 lead to acid rain.
The administration's plan could cost utilities, mainly those that *T*-1 use coal, up to $4 billion *U* a year.
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on clean - air legislation.
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell has almost single - handed control over clean - air legislation.
People close to the utility industry said 0 Mr. Dingell's proposal appears *-3 to guarantee only an estimated seven - million - ton cut in annual sulfur - dioxide emissions that *T*-2 lead to acid rain, though additional cuts could be ordered *-1 later.
Mr. Bush's legislative package promises *PRO*-1 to cut emissions by 10 million tons--basically in half--by the year 2000.
Although final details weren't available, sources said 0 the Dingell plan would abandon the president's proposal for a cap on utilities' sulfur - dioxide emissions.
That proposal had been hailed *-1 by environmentalists but despised *-1 by utilities because they feared 0 it would limit their growth.
It also would junk an innovative market - based system for *PRO* trading emissions credits among polluters.
In addition, it is believed *-1 to offer a cost - sharing mechanism that *T*-2 would help *PRO*-3 subsidize the clean - up costs for the dirtiest coal - fired utilities in the country, *PRO*-3 sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills.
The administration, *PRO*-1 sticking to its vow of *PRO* avoiding tax increases, has staunchly opposed cost - sharing.
Mr. Dingell's staff was expected *-2 to present its acid - rain alternative to other committee members, apparently in an attempt *PRO* to appease Midwestern lawmakers from high - polluting states who *T*-1 insist on cost - sharing.
It *EXP*-1 isn't clear, however, whether support for the proposal will be broad enough *PRO* to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acid - rain plan.
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities, it might not win the support of utilities, many in the West, that *T*-1 already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleaner - burning fuels.
Lawmakers representing some of the cleaner utilities have been quietly working with the White House *PRO*-1 to devise ways 0 *PRO* to tinker with the administration bill *T*-2 *PRO* to address their acid - rain concerns *PPA*-3.
Trinity Industries Inc. said 0 it reached a preliminary agreement *PRO* to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Trinity said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to begin delivery in the first quarter of next year.
The record corn - buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline.
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling *PRO*-1 to find enough river barges and trains 0 *T*-2 to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for *PRO* loading onto Soviet ships.
River barge rates have soared 40% this fall from a year earlier.
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business.
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge *PRO*-1 to find enough of the crop 0 *T*-2 to meet their obligations to the Soviets.
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn *ICH*-2 in October, which *T*-1 is the most ever sold * to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. .
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered *-2 by January, which *T*-1 would be a strain in most years.
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River, on which flows *T*-1 much of the U.S. corn that *T*-3 is shipped *-2 overseas.
"We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record," said *T*-1 William Dunton, a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert.
"It is going *-1 to be real tight."
Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains, the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges 0 their tows push *T*-1 at one time.
In a few weeks, many barges probably won't be able *PRO*-2 to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning *-3 to reduce the flow of the Missouri River, which *T*-1 feeds into the Mississippi River.
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that *T*-1 feed it.
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain *ICH*-3 this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation.
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue *-1 falling this month.
At St. Louis, the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed *-1 *T*-2, an Army Corps spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years.
So far, the grain industry's budding logistical problems haven't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade.
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded * there *PRO*-1 to calculate the price 0 they offer *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to buy corn from farmers.
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel *PRO*-1 to settle at $2.375 *U* a bushel.
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted * by the 1988 drought.
With the harvest winding down, however, some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try *PRO*-1 to gather the corn 0 they are obligated *-3 *PRO*-4 to deliver *T*-2.
Farmers are in the best position of many years 0 *PRO* to push up corn prices *T*-1.
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles, they have more than enough storage space for their new crop, and that permits them *PRO*-1 to wait for prices to rise.
In parts of Iowa, for example, some grain elevators are offering farmers $2.15 *U* a bushel for corn.
Many farmers probably wouldn't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel, said 0 *T*-1 Lyle Reed, president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo, Iowa.
It *EXP*-1 isn't clear, however, who *T*-2 would win a waiting game.
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought, the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one - fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins.
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry's problems might spark investors to begin *-1 buying corn futures contracts--*PRO*-2 only to see little appreciation.
"The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain 0 *T*-3 to be shipped *-1 *T*-2," said *T*-4 Bill Biedermann, Allendale Inc. research director.
Although much of this country's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge, it *EXP*-1 is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by *PRO*-2 shipping a larger - than - normal amount of corn by train to the port.
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans.
One railroad, for example, is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore.
And it *EXP*-2 isn't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace.
The Soviet orders were compressed *-1 into the month of October because of delays.
The Soviet Union usually begins *-1 buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall.
But its purchases apparently were delayed *-1 by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading, but much of the action was in heating oil.
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged *-1 in a fire, *PRO* tightening an already tight European market.
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon, up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $19.94 *U* a barrel.
Gasoline futures continued a sell - off that *T*-1 began Monday.
PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets.
December delivery gold fell $3.20 *U* an ounce to $377.60 *U*.
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $5.2180 *U*.
January platinum was down $5.70 *U* an ounce at $494.50 *U*.
Precious metals, gold in particular, currently are being influenced *-1 more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability, according to William O'Neill, vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York.
"The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities," he said *T*-1.
Yesterday, the stock market rose strongly, *PRO* creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders, he said 0 *T*-1.
Silver and platinum, which *T*-1 have more of an industrial nature than gold, were even weaker, he said 0 *T*-2.
Silver is also under pressure of "extremely high" inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange, he said 0 *T*-1.
Yesterday, these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces, according to an exchange spokesman.
COPPER: Futures prices partially recovered Monday's declines because Chilean miners voted *PRO*-1 to strike.
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $1.14 *U*.
In Chile, workers at two copper mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which *T*-1 belong to the Exxon - owned Minera Disputada, yesterday voted *PRO*-2 to begin a full strike tomorrow, an analyst said 0 *T*-3.
Reasons for the walkout, the analyst said 0 *?*, included a number of procedural issues, such as a right *PRO* to strike.
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was *T*-1 a sympathetic reaction to stocks.
In the case of copper, he said 0 *?*, the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected *-1 in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal.
Also contributing to the firmness in copper, the analyst noted 0 *?*, was *T*-3 a report by Chicago purchasing agents, which *T*-1 precedes the full purchasing agents' report that *T*-2 is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold *T*-5.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's October index rose to 51.6% after three previous months of readings below 50%.
The September index was 47.1%.
A reading below 50% generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy, while a reading above 50% points to expansion.
The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50%.
Although his team lost the World Series, San Francisco Giants owner Bob Lurie hopes *PRO*-1 to have a new home for them.
He is an avid fan of a proposition on next week's ballot 0 *PRO* to help *PRO* build a replacement for Candlestick Park *T*-1.
Small wonder, since he's asking San Francisco taxpayers *PRO*-1 to sink up to $100 million *U* into the new stadium.
As San Francisco digs out from The Pretty Big One, opponents say 0 the last thing 0 the city can afford *T*-1 is an expensive new stadium.
A stadium craze is sweeping the country.
It's fueled *-1 by the increasing profitability of major - league teams.
Something like one - third of the nation's 60 largest cities *ICH*-1 are thinking about new stadiums, ranging from Cleveland to San Antonio and St. Petersburg.
Most boosters claim 0 the new sports complexes will be moneymakers for their city.
Pepperdine University economist Dean Baim scoffs at that.
He has looked at 14 baseball and football stadiums and found that only one--private Dodger Stadium--brought more money *ICH*-1 into a city than it took out.
Stadiums tend *-1 to redistribute existing wealth within a community, not create more of it.
Voters generally agree when they are given *-1 a chance *PRO* to decide if they want *PRO*-3 to sink their own tax dollars into a new mega-stadium *T*-2.
San Francisco voters rejected a new ballpark two years ago.
Last month, Phoenix voters turned thumbs down on a $100 million *U* stadium bond and tax proposition.
Its backers fielded every important interest on their team--a popular mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, the major media--and spent $100,000 *U* on promotion.
But voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself, and rejected it 59% to 41% *U*.
In San Francisco, its backers concede 0 the ballpark is at best running *PRO* even in the polls.
George Christopher, the former San Francisco mayor who *T*-1 built Candlestick Park for the Giants in the 1960s, won't endorse the new ballpark.
He says 0 he had Candlestick built *-1 because the Giants claimed 0 they needed 10,000 parking spaces.
Since the new park will have only 1,500 spaces, Mr. Christopher thinks 0 backers are playing some fiscal "games" of their own with the voters.
Stadium boosters claim that without public money they would never be built *-1.
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie disagrees, and he can prove it.
Several years ago he gave up *PRO*-3 trying *PRO*-1 to persuade Miami *PRO*-2 to improve its city - owned Orange Bowl, and instead built his own $100 million *U* coliseum with private funds.
He didn't see why the taxpayers should help *PRO* build something 0 he would then use *T*-1 *PRO*-4 to turn a healthy profit *T*-3.
"This stadium shows that anything 0 government can do *T*-2, we can do *-3 better," Mr. Robbie says *T*-1.
But to Moon Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who *T*-1 helped *PRO* build that city's cavernous, money - losing Superdome, questions of who *T*-2 benefits or the bottom line are of little relevance.
"The Superdome is an exercise in optimism, a statement of faith," he has said *T*-1.
"It is the very building of it *ICH*-4 that *T*-2 is important, not how much of it *T*-3 is used *-1 or its economics."
An Egyptian Pharaoh couldn't have justified his pyramids any better.
But civilization has moved forward since then.
Today taxpayers get *PRO*-1 to vote, most of the time, on whether they want *PRO*-2 to finance the building schemes of our modern political pharaohs, or let private money erect these playgrounds for public passions.
Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record, net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $59.9 billion *U* last year.
The previous record was $57.7 billion *U* in 1987, according to the Agriculture Department.
Net cash income--the amount left * in farmers' pockets after *PRO* deducting expenses from gross cash income--increased in 33 states in 1988, as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices, the department's Economic Research Service reported 0 *T*-1 yesterday.
Most of those states set farm income records.
The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains.
What *T*-42 saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity *PRO* to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had "mortgaged" *T*-1 to the government under price - support loan programs.
With prices soaring, they were able *PRO*-1 to sell the reclaimed commodities at "considerable profit," the agency's 240 - page report said 0 *T*-2.
In less parched areas, meanwhile, farmers who *T*-43 had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices.
To the surprise of some analysts, net cash income rose in some of the hardest - hit states, including Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska and the Dakotas.
Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $4 billion *U* disaster - assistance package enacted * by Congress.
Last year's record net cash income confirms the farm sector's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s.
It also helps *PRO*-2 explain the reluctance *ICH*-1 of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers *PRO* to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year.
Commodity prices have been rising in recent years, with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year, as the government curtailed production with land - idling programs *PRO*-1 to reduce price - depressing surpluses.
At the same time, export demand for U.S. wheat, corn and other commodities strengthened, said *T*-1 Keith Collins, a department analyst.
Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices, as the nation's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30 - year low.
"All of these forces came together in 1988 *PRO* to benefit agriculture," Mr. Collins said *T*-1.
California led the nation with $6.5 billion *U* in net cash income last year, followed by Texas, $3.9 billion *U*; Iowa, $3.4 billion *U*; Florida, $3.1 billion *U*; and Minnesota, $2.7 billion *U*.
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states 0 *T*-1 to log a decline in net cash income.
Despite federal disaster relief, the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers, according to the department.
Many lost their farms.
Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was *?*.
Indeed, net cash income is likely *-1 to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline.
At the same time, an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn, soybeans and other commodities, *PRO* causing a fall in prices that *T*-2 has been only partly cushioned *-3 by heavy grain buying by the Soviets.
Last year, government payments to farmers slipped to less than $14.5 billion *U* from a record $16.7 billion *U* in 1987.
Payments are expected *-1 to range between $9 billion *U* and $12 billion *U* this year.
Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation's old bridges need *-1 to be repaired or replaced *-13.
But there's disagreement over how *PRO* to do it *T*-1.
Highway officials insist 0 the ornamental railings on older bridges aren't strong enough *PRO* to prevent vehicles from *PRO* crashing through.
But other people don't want *PRO*-1 to lose the bridges' beautiful, sometimes historic, features.
"The primary purpose of a railing is *PRO* to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view," says *T*-1 Jack White, a planner with the Indiana Highway Department.
He and others prefer *PRO*-1 to install railings such as the "type F safety shape," a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings.
In Richmond, Ind., the type F railing is being used *-1 *PRO* to replace arched openings on the G Street Bridge.
Garret Boone, who *T*-11 teaches art at Earlham College, calls the new structure *PRO*-12 "just an ugly bridge" and one that *T*-1 blocks the view of a new park below.
In Hartford, Conn., the Charter Oak Bridge will soon be replaced *-14, the cast - iron medallions from its railings relegated to a park.
Compromises are possible.
Citizens in Peninsula, Ohio, *PRO*-1 upset over changes to a bridge, negotiated a deal: The bottom half of the railing will be type F, while the top half will have the old bridge's floral pattern.
Similarly, highway engineers agreed *PRO*-1 to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington, D.C., as long as they could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road.
Tray Bon?
Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons
*PRO* PORTING POTABLES just got easier, or so claims Scypher Corp., the maker of the Cup - Tote.
The Chicago company's beverage carrier, *PRO*-1 meant *PRO*-2 to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast - food outlets, resembles the plastic loops used * on six - packs of beer, only the loops hang from a web of strings.
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once.
Inventor Claire Marvin says 0 his design virtually eliminates spilling.
Lids aren't even needed *-1.
He also claims 0 the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers.
A few fast - food outlets are giving it a try.
The company acknowledges some problems.
A driver has *-1 to find something 0 *PRO* to hang the carrier on *T*-2, so the company supplies a window hook.
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight, it isn't recyclable.
And unlike some trays, there's no place for food.
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides.
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities.
The show runs the gamut, from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building.
The event continues into next year and includes an exchange program *PRO* to swap design teachers at Carnegie - Mellon and Leningrad's Mutchin Institute.
Dan Droz, leader of the Carnegie - Mellon group, sees benefits all around.
The Soviets, who *T*-12 normally have few clients other than the state, will get "exposure to a market system," he says 0 *T*-1.
Americans will learn more about *PRO* making products for the Soviets.
Mr. Droz says 0 the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose.
"In Moscow, they kept *-5 asking us things like, ` Why do you make 15 different corkscrews, when all 0 you need *T*-3 is one good one *T*-4 *T*-2?"' he says *T*-1.
"They got us thinking 0 maybe we should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than *PRO*-1 always developing new ones."
Seed for Jail Solution Fails *-1 to Take Root
IT'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal: Eggers Group architects propose *PRO*-2 using grain elevators *PRO*-1 to house prisoners.
It would ease jail overcrowding while *PRO*-1 preserving historic structures, the company says 0 *T*-2.
But New York state, which *T*-13 is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage, says "no."
Grain elevators built * in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that *T*-1 would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle, the New York firm says 0 *T*-2.
Many are far enough from residential areas *PRO* to pass public muster, yet close enough *PRO* to permit family visits.
Besides, Eggers says 0 *?*, grain elevators are worth *PRO* preserving for aesthetic reasons--one famed architect compared them to the pyramids of Egypt.
A number of cities--including Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Houston--have vacant grain elevators, Eggers says 0 *T*-1.
A medium - sized one in Brooklyn, it says 0 *?*, could be altered *-2 *PRO*-3 to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than *PRO* building a new prison in upstate New York.
A spokesman for the state, however, calls the idea *PRO*-1 "not effective or cost efficient.
Due to an editing error, a letter to the editor in yesterday's edition from Frederick H. Hallett mistakenly identified the NRDC.
It should be the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered to double - C from triple - C the rating on about $130 million *U* of debt.
The rating concern said 0 the textile and clothing company's interest expense exceeds operating profit "by a wide margin" and it noted United's estimated after - tax loss of $24 million *U* for the year ended June 30.
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry.
Because of the rulings, the Commerce Department will continue *-1 to investigate complaints *ICH*-2 by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act.
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter's home market.
ITC officials said 0 final Commerce Department and ITC rulings won't come until next March or later.
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law, the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports, which *T*-1 already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements.
Imports of manmade - fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $405 million *U* from Taiwan, $400 million *U* from South Korea and $125 million *U* from Hong Kong, according to the ITC.
In another action, the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed * by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington, Del., against imports of neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, from France and West Germany.
These imports totaled about $17 million *U* last year.
Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by *PRO*-1 uttering again and again the same seven words: "Provided, that no funds shall be spent *-48...."
This phrase once again is found *-49 throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress.
It signals Congress's attempt *ICH*-1, under the pretext of *PRO* guarding the public purse, *PRO* to deny the president the funding necessary *PRO* to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified * in Article II of the Constitution.
This species of congressional action is predicated *-50 on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that *T*-1 is erroneous and unconstitutional.
The appropriations clause states that "No Money shall be drawn *-51 from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made * by Law...."
The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability *PRO* to withhold funding.
This interpretation was officially endorsed *-1 by Congress in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report.
As partisans of congressional power understand, a "power of the purse" so broadly construed * would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers.
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution.
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, according to Madison's notes.
To the extent 0 they did, their concern was *PRO*-1 to ensure fiscal accountability.
Moreover, the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources 0 *PRO* to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed *T*-2 poorly under the Articles of Confederation *T*-1.
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause (technically a limitation on legislative power) could be read *-52 as *PRO*-52 placing the president on Congress's short leash, *PRO*-52 making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress.
As it went to the conference panel now deliberating, the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts *ICH*-1 by Congress *PRO* to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of *PRO* protecting the public's money.
During the coming weeks, President Bush must decide whether *PRO* to veto the bills containing them--or, alternatively, *PRO* to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II, and thus void and severable.
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts *PRO*-1 to strip the president of his powers *PRO* to make certain appointments as *PRO* provided *-2 by Article II.
Article II places on the president the duty *PRO* to nominate *RNR*-1, "and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate" appoint *RNR*-1, ambassadors, judges, and other officers of the U.S. .
It also empowers the president *PRO*-41 to make recess appointments, without Senate approval: "The President shall have Power *PRO* to fill up all Vacancies that *T*-1 may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by *PRO*-2 granting Commissions which *T*-40 shall expire at the End of their next Session."
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides: "No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained * in this or any other Act shall be paid *-53 to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated *-54 *T*-1 after the Senate has voted *PRO*-2 not to approve the nomination of said person."
Thus, with one brief passage in an appropriations bill, Congress repeals the president's power *PRO* to make recess appointments under Article II.
Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability *PRO* to nominate candidates of his choosing.
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied *-55 funding 0 *PRO* to pay that person's salary *T*-1.
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by *PRO*-1 choosing people willing *PRO* to serve without pay, because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government.
The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of "muzzling" provisions that *T*-1 violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution.
Muzzling provisions, which *T*-1 might be called *-56 *PRO*-57 "blindfold laws" as well, prevent the executive branch from *PRO*-2 even looking at certain policy options, let alone from *PRO*-2 recommending them to Congress.
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that *T*-1 requires the president *PRO*-42 to make recommendations to Congress, but which *T*-41 gives the president the discretion 0 *PRO* to select the subject matter of those recommendations *T*-2.
Typically, these laws seek *PRO*-1 to prevent executive branch officials from *PRO*-2 inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations.
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that *T*-1 prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from *PRO*-2 subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny.
There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from *PRO*-1 even studying whether public funds are being wasted *-57 in some favored program or other.
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained * in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better *ICH*-1 illustrates Congress's attempt *PRO* to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive - office bill: "None of the funds made *PRO* available *PRO* pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used *-2 *PRO* to implement, administer, or enforce any regulation which *T*-3 has been disapproved *-58 pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted * in accordance with the applicable law of the United States."
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law, since a one - house resolution could be said *-1 to be "duly adopted" even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto.
The Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional.
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that *T*-1 contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability *PRO* to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives.
If President Bush fails *-1 to do so in his first year, he will invite Congress, for the remainder of his presidency, *PRO*-2 to rewrite Article II of the Constitution *PRO*-3 to suit its purposes.
What *T*-1 becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult 0 for future presidents, including Democrats, to undo *T*-2.
President Reagan learned that lesson.
By 1987, then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting *PRO*-1 to direct the president, through an appropriations rider, *PRO*-2 to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II.
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch *PRO*-2 unfunded, the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision, *PRO*-1 declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable.
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power.
However, the president does have a duty *PRO* not to violate the Constitution.
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto.
Excision of appropriations riders that *T*-1 trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line - item veto.
As *PRO* discussed in the context of *PRO* controlling federal spending, the line - item veto is characterized *-59 as a way 0 for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that *T*-2 are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives *T*-1.
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability.
One could argue that it *EXP*-1 is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president, by *PRO*-2 exerting a power of excision, to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that *T*-3 violate the separation of powers.
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills.
If Congress does nothing, President Bush will have won.
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court (*PRO*-2 assuming 0 it can establish standing 0 *PRO* to sue *T*-1), President Bush might win.
In that case, he might receive an opinion *ICH*-2 from the court that *T*-1 is a vindication of the president's right *PRO* to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives 0 the framers thought 0 *T*-3 should be entrusted *-60 to the executive.
If President Bush loses at the court, it might be disappointing, as Morrison v. Olson was *?* for the Reagan administration.
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is *?* now.
Moreover, the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice *T*-1.
As it stands now, Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills *PRO*-1 lying down.
President Bush should set things *PRO*-1 straight.
If he does not, he will help *PRO* realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature "everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex."
Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the Reagan administration.
His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is *PRO*-1 to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year.
*PRO* Hold the Putty!

Despite a deluge of economic news, the Treasury market remained quiet but the corporate market was abuzz over International Business Machines Corp.'s huge debt offering.
"There were so many economic reports but the market didn't care about any of them," said *T*-1 Kathleen Camilli, a money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
"So the focus turned to other fixed - income markets, corporate and mortgages in particular," she said *T*-1.
IBM, the giant computer maker, offered $750 million *U* of non-callable 30 - year debentures priced * *PRO*-1 to yield 8.47%, or about 1/2 percentage point higher than the yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds.
The size of IBM's issue was increased *-1 from an originally planned $500 million *U* as money managers and investors scrambled *PRO*-2 to buy the bonds.
In the investment - grade corporate market, "it's rare that you get an opportunity *PRO* to buy a name that *T*-1 has such broad appeal and has such attractive call features," said 0 *T*-2 James Ednie, a Drexel industrial bond trader.
Money managers ranked IBM's offering as the most significant investment - grade sale of the year because large issues of long - term debt by companies with triple - A credit are infrequent.
Syndicate officials at lead underwriter Salomon Brothers Inc. said 0 the debentures were snapped by up *-1 pension funds, banks, insurance companies and other institutional investors.
In the Treasury market, investors paid scant attention to the day's economic reports, which *T*-1 for the most part provided a mixed view of the economy.
"Whether you thought 0 the economy was growing weak or holding *PRO* steady, yesterday's economic indicators didn't change your opinion," said *T*-1 Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
The government reported that orders for manufactured goods were essentially unchanged in September while construction spending was slightly lower.
Both indicators were viewed *-1 as signs that the nation's industrial sector is growing very slowly, if at all.
A survey by the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks and the latest report by the National Association of Purchasing Management blurred that picture of the economy.
In a monthly report prepared * for use at the Fed's next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 14., the nation's central bank found that price increases have moderated and economic activity has grown at a sluggish pace in recent weeks.
Among other things, the survey found that manufacturing activity varied considerably across districts and among industries.
The Philadelphia and Cleveland districts, for example, reported declines in manufacturing activity while the Boston, Dallas and San Francisco banks noted that business expanded.
The purchasing managers index of economic activity rose in October, although it remains below 50%.
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding.
Mr. Lieberman said 0 the diverse showing in yesterday's reports "only enhances the importance of the employment data."
The employment report, which at times *T*-1 has caused wide swings in bond prices, is due out tomorrow.
The average estimate of 22 economists polled * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October.
The economists forecast a 0.1% rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4%.
Treasury Securities
In a surprise announcement, the Treasury said 0 it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30 - year bond rather than create a new one for next week's quarterly refunding of the federal debt.
The Treasury will raise $10 billion *U* in fresh cash by *PRO*-1 selling $30 billion *U* of securities, including $10 billion *U* of new three - year notes and $10 billion *U* of new 10 - year notes.
But rather than *PRO* sell new 30 - year bonds, the Treasury will issue $10 billion *U* of 29year, nine - month bonds--*PRO*-2 essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30 - year bond that *T*-3 was sold *-1 at the previous refunding in August.
Credit market analysts said 0 the decision *PRO* to reopen the current benchmark, the 8 1/8% bond due August 2019, is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount.
Some dealers said 0 the Treasury's intent is *PRO* to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities, *PRO* given uncertainties about when the auction will occur *T*-1.
The Treasury said 0 the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling.
Until such action takes places, the Treasury has no ability *PRO* to issue new debt of any kind.
Meanwhile, Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading.
The benchmark 30 - year bond about 1/4 point, or $2.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The benchmark was priced *-1 at 102 22/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.88% compared with 102 12/32 *PRO* to yield 7.90% Tuesday.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 at 100 22/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.88% compared with 100 16/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.90%.
The discount rate on three - month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79%, while the rate on six - month bills was slightly lower at 7.52% compared with 7.60% Tuesday.
Corporate Issues
IBM's $750 million *U* debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market.
Meanwhile, most investment - grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher.
In its latest compilation of performance statistics, Moody's Investors Service found that investment - grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7% in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5%.
Moody's said 0 those returns compare with a 3.8% total return for longer - term Treasury notes and bonds.
Total return measures price changes and interest income.
For the year to date, Moody's said 0 total returns were topped *-1 by the 16.5% of longer - term Treasury issues, *PRO*-2 closely followed *-3 by 15% for investment - grade bonds.
Junk bonds trailed the group again.
"Even the 7.2% return from the risk - free three - month Treasury bill has easily outdistanced the 4.1% return from junk bonds," wrote *T*-1 Moody's economist John Lonski in yesterday's market report.
"Little wonder that buyers for junk have been found *-1 wanting," he said *T*-2.
Moody's said 0 the average net asset value of 24 junk - bond mutual funds fell by 4.2% in October.
Mortgage - Backed Issues
Mortgage securities ended slightly higher but trailed gains in the Treasury market.
Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 5/8, up 2/32, and its 9 1/2% issue at 100 22/32, also up 2/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% securities were yielding 9.32% to a 12 - year average life.
Activity was light in derivative markets, with no new issues priced *-1.
Municipal Issues
Municipal bonds were mostly unchanged to up 1/8 point in light, cautious trading prior to tomorrow's unemployment report.
A $114 million *U* issue of health facility revenue bonds from the California Health Facilities Financing Authority was temporarily withdrawn *-1 after *PRO*-1 being tentatively priced *-2 by a First Boston Corp. group.
An official for the lead underwriter declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the reason for the delay, but market participants speculated that a number of factors, including a lack of investor interest, were responsible.
The issue could be relaunched *-1, possibly in a restructured form, as early as next week, according to the lead underwriter.
A $107.03 million *U* offering of Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency, Calif., tax allocation bonds got off to a slow start and may be repriced *-1 at lower levels today, according to an official with lead underwriter Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
The Santa Ana bonds were tentatively priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield from 6.40% in 1991 to 7.458% in
*PRO*-1 Bucking the market trend, an issue of $130 million *U* general obligation distributable state aid bonds from Detroit, Mich., apparently drew solid investor interest.
They were tentatively priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield from 6.20% in 1991 to 7.272% in
Foreign Bond
West German dealers said 0 there was little interest in Treasury bonds ahead of Thursday's new government bond issue.
So far, they said 0 *?*, investors appear *-3 unenthusiastic about the new issue which *T*-1 might force the government *PRO*-2 to raise the coupon to more than 7%.
It is generally expected *-1 to be the usual 10 - year, four billion mark issue.
Rumors to the contrary have been that it would be a six billion mark issue, or that the last Bund, a 7% issue due October 1999, would be increased *-1 by two billion marks.
Elsewhere:
-- In Japan, the benchmark No. 111 4.6% issue due 1998 ended on brokers screens unchanged at 95.09 *PRO*-1 to yield 5.435%.
-- In Britain, the benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003 / 2007 fell 14/32 to 111 2/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.19%.
The 12% notes due 1995 fell 9/32 to 103 3/8 *PRO*-1 to yield 11.10%.
For six years, T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode: kind and gentle.
The question now: Can he act more like hard - charging Teddy Roosevelt?
Mr. Hahn, the 62 - year - old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia - Pacific Corp. is leading the forest - product concern's unsolicited $3.19 billion *U* bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder, a reaction 0 Mr. Hahn hasn't faced *T*-2 in his 18 earlier acquisitions, all of which *T*-3 were negotiated *-1 behind the scenes.
So far, Mr. Hahn is trying *PRO*-1 to entice Nekoosa into *PRO* negotiating a friendly surrender while *PRO*-1 talking tough.
"We are prepared *PRO*-1 to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction," he says *T*-2.
But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war, with all 0 that implies *T*-1.
If a competitor enters the game, for example, Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of *PRO* paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival.
*PRO*-2 Given *-3 that choice, associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say 0 the former university president--who *T*-1 has developed a reputation for *PRO* not overpaying for anything--would fold.
"There's a price above which I'm positive 0 Marshall has the courage 0 *PRO* not to pay *T*-1 *T*-3," says *T*-2 A.D. Correll, Georgia - Pacific's executive vice president for pulp and paper.
Says *ICH*-1 long - time associate Jerry Griffin, vice president, corporate development, at WTD Industries Inc.: "He isn't of the old school of *PRO* winning at any cost."
He also is a consensus manager, insiders say 0 *T*-1.
The decision *PRO* to make the bid for Nekoosa, for example, was made *-2 only after all six members of Georgia - Pacific's management committee signed onto the deal--even though Mr. Hahn knew 0 he wanted *PRO*-3 to go after the company early on, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Correll.
Associates say 0 Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
*PRO*-1 Assuming that post at the age of 35, he managed by consensus, as *PRO* is the rule in universities, says 0 *T*-3 Warren H. Strother, a university official who *T*-2 is researching a book on Mr. Hahn.
But he also showed a willingness *PRO*-1 to take a strong stand.
In 1970, Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who *T*-3 were occupying a university building.
That impressed Robert B. Pamplin, Georgia - Pacific's chief executive at the time, whom Mr. Hahn had met *T*-4 while *PRO*-1 fundraising for the institute.
In 1975, Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into *PRO* joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in Georgia - Pacific who *T*-5 didn't believe 0 a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world.
But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks, *PRO*-1 demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says 0 he knew 0 he possessed *T*-2 early on.
*PRO*-1 The son of a physicist, Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates.
*PRO*-1 Moving rapidly through school, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18, after *PRO* spending only 2 1/2 years in college.
He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Hahn agrees that he has a "retentive" memory, but friends say 0 that's an understatement.
They call it *PRO*-1 "photographic".
Mr. Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of Georgia - Pacific.
*PRO*-1 Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983, he inherited a company that *T*-6 was mired *-2 in debt and hurt *-2 by a recession - inspired slide in its building - products business.
Mr. Hahn began *-1 selling non-core businesses, such as oil and gas and chemicals.
He even sold one unit that *T*-7 made vinyl checkbook covers.
At the same time, he began *-1 building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while *PRO*-1 refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling, rather than materials for new - home construction.
The idea was *PRO* to buffet building products from cycles in new - home construction.
The formula has paid off, so far.
Georgia - Pacific's sales climbed to $9.5 billion *U* last year, compared with $6 billion *U* in 1983, when Mr. Hahn took the reins *T*-1.
Profit from continuing operations has soared to $467 million *U* from $75 million *U*.
Mr. Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of *PRO* concentrating on what a company knows *T*-1 *PRO*-2 best.
"The record of companies that *T*-8 have diversified isn't all that impressive," he says *T*-1.
Nekoosa wouldn't be a diversification.
It would be a good match, Mr. Hahn and many analysts say 0 *?*, of two healthy companies with high - quality assets and strong cash flows.
The resulting company would be the largest forest - products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $13 billion *U*.
But can Mr. Hahn carry it off?
In this instance, industry observers say 0 *?*, he is entering uncharted waters.
Says *ICH*-1 Kathryn McAuley, an analyst at First Manhattan Co.: "This is the greatest acquisition challenge 0 he has faced *T*-2.
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interest - rate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks.
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts 0 the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up *T*-1 after *PRO*-2 losing heavily on swap transactions.
As many as 70 U.K. and international banks stand *PRO*-1 to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld *-2 and set a precedent for other municipalities.
An appeal is expected *-68.
In response to the ruling, gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before *PRO*-1 recovering much of the loss by the end of the session.
Gilts, or British government bonds, which *T*-60 also fell sharply initially, retraced some of the losses *PRO*-1 to end about 3/8 point lower.
The council, which *T*-61 is alleged *PRO*-1 to have engaged in over 600 deals valued * at over #6 billion *U* ($9.5 billion *U*), lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals.
At one point, Hammersmith is reported *-1 to have accounted for as much as 10% of the sterling market in interest - rate swap dealings.
When two parties engage in an interest - rate swap *T*-1, they are betting against each other on future rates.
Thus, an institution obligated *PRO* to make fixed - rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating - rate payments.
In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed *PRO*-1 to make floating - rate payments to banks, which *T*-62 would make fixed - rate payments.
As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them.
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who *T*-63 argued that local councils aren't vested *-1 with constitutional authority *PRO* to engage in such capital - markets activities.
The council backed the audit commission's stand that the swap transactions are illegal.
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capital - markets transactions, the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils.
"While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith, it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature," a solicitor representing one of the banks said *T*-1.
Already, 10 local councils have refused *PRO*-1 to honor fees and payments to banks incurred * during various swaps dealings.
Other financial institutions involved * include Barclays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Security Pacific Corp., Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bank, Citicorp's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International.
If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal, it *EXP*-1 is possible that they would seek *PRO*-3 to have the illegality ruling work both ways, some market sources said 0 *T*-2.
Banks could seek *PRO*-1 to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils *T*-2.
Officials from the various banks involved * are expected *-1 to meet during the next few days *PRO*-2 to consider other arrangements with local authorities that *T*-3 could be questionable.
The banks have 28 days 0 *PRO* to file an appeal against the ruling *T*-2 and are expected *-1 to do so shortly.
Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said 0 potential problems with the construction of two big cruise ships from Finland have been averted *-1.
Last week, Miami - based Carnival disclosed that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that *T*-1 is building Carnival's new cruise ships, planned *PRO*-2 to file for bankruptcy.
Yesterday, Carnival said 0 a new company *ICH*-1 has been formed *-2 in Finland that *T*-3 will carry on Waertsilae's shipbuilding operations.
Carnival said 0 it will be an 11% shareholder in the new company.
Carnival said 0 the Fantasy, a 2,050 - passenger ship that *T*-3 was slated *-4 *PRO*-5 to be delivered *-2 this month, will be delivered *-1 in January.
A second ship is now expected *-2 to be delivered *-1 late next year or early in 1991.
Carnival had expected that ship to be delivered *-1 next fall.
A planned third ship still may be built *-1 in the Finnish shipyard, or may be built *-1 elsewhere, Carnival said 0 *T*-2.
Program trading is "a racket," complains 0 *?* Edward Egnuss, a White Plains, N.Y., investor and electronics sales executive, "and it's not to the benefit of the small investor, that's for sure."
But although he thinks that it is hurting him, he doubts 0 it could be stopped *-1.
Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed *-1 by many small investors interviewed * by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country.
But like Mr. Egnuss, few expect it to be halted *-1 entirely, and a surprising number doubt 0 it should be *?*.
"I think 0 program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor," says *T*-1 Leo Fields, a Dallas investor.
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades, that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading *T*-1.
But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility.
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds.
He adds: "The market may be giving us another message, that a recession is looming."
Or, as Dorothy Arighi, an interior decorator in Arnold, Calif., puts it: "All kinds of funny things spook the market these days."
But she believes that "program trading creates deviant swings.
It's not a sound thing; there's no inherent virtue in it."
She adds that legislation curbing it would be "a darned good idea."
At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district, a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading.
*PRO*-1 Citing the October 1987 crash, Glenn Miller says, "It's like the last crash--they threatened, but no one did anything."
A. Donald Anderson, a 59 - year - old Los Angeles investor who *T*-1 says 0 the stock market's "fluctuations and gyrations give me the heebie - jeebies," doesn't see much point in *PRO* outlawing program trading.
Those who *T*-1 still want *PRO*-2 to do it "will just find some way 0 *PRO* to get around" any attempt *PRO* to curb it *T*-3.
Similarly, Rick Wamre, a 31 - year - old asset manager for a Dallas real - estate firm, would like *PRO*-1 to see program trading disappear because "I can't see that it does anything for the market or the country."
Yet he isn't in favor of new legislation.
"I think 0 we've got enough securities laws," he says *T*-1.
"I'd much rather see them dealing with interest rates and the deficit."
Peter Anthony, who *T*-1 runs an employment agency in New York, decries program trading as "*PRO* limiting the game to a few," but he also isn't sure 0 it should be more strictly regulated *-2.
"I don't want *PRO*-1 to denounce it because *PRO* denouncing it would be like *PRO* denouncing capitalism," he explains *T*-2.
And surprising numbers of small investors seem *-1 to be adapting to greater stock market volatility and say 0 they can live with program trading.
Glenn Britta, a 25 - year - old New York financial analyst who *T*-1 plays options for his personal account, says 0 he is "factoring" the market's volatility "into investment decisions."
He adds that program trading "increases liquidity in the market.
You can't hold back technology."
And the practice shouldn't be stopped *-1, he says 0 *?*, because "even big players aren't immune to the rigors of program trading."
*PRO*-2 Also in New York, Israel Silverman, an insurance - company lawyer, comments that program trading "increases volatility, but I don't think 0 it should be banned *-1.
There's no culprit here.
The market is just becoming more efficient."
*PRO* Arbitraging on differences between spot and futures prices is an important part of many financial markets, he says 0 *T*-1.
He adds that his shares in a company savings plan are invested *-1 in a mutual fund, and volatility, on a given day, may hurt the fund.
But "I'm a long - term investor," he says *T*-1.
"If you were a short - term investor, you might be more leery about program trading."
Jim Enzor of Atlanta defends program trading because he believes that it can bring the market back up after a plunge.
"If we have a real bad day, the program would say, ` *PRO* Buy,"' he explains *T*-1.
"If you could get the rhythm of the program trading, you could take advantage of it."
What else can a small investor do *T*-1?
Scott Taccetta, a Chicago accountant, is going into money - market funds.
Mr. Taccetta says 0 he had just recouped the $5,000 *U* 0 he lost *T*-1 in the 1987 crash when he lost more money last Oct. 13 *T*-2.
Now, he plans *PRO*-1 to sell all his stocks by the first quarter of 1990.

The committee's members are worried what all this free food might do *T*-2 to the economic prospects of Poland's own farmers.
Rep. Gary Ackerman noted that past food aid had harmed farmers in El Salvador and Egypt.
However well intentioned, food transfers have the habit of *PRO* growing larger and wrecking the market incentives for the recipient country's own farmers.
The First World has for some time had the bad habit of *PRO* smothering other people's economies with this kind of unfocused kindness.
It should be constantly stressed that Poland's farmers mostly need a real market for their products.

Most contracts are simply nullified *-1 by an opposite trade before they come due.
Indexing--Many investors, mainly institutions, follow an investment strategy of *PRO* buying and holding a mix of stocks 0 *T*-1 to match the performance of a broad stock - market barometer such as the S&P 500.
Many institutional index funds are active program traders, *PRO*-1 swapping their stocks for futures when profitable *PRO* to do so *T*-2.
Program trading--A wide range of computer - assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks.
Quant--Generally, any Wall Street analyst who *T*-1 employs quantitive research techniques.

For example, there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index.
Uptick--An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security.
The Labor Department cited USX Corp. for numerous health and safety violations at two Pennsylvania plants, and proposed $7.3 million *U* in fines, the largest penalty ever proposed * for alleged workplace violations by an employer.
The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of $6.1 million *U* for alleged violations at the company's Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill; that was a record for proposed penalties at any single facility.
OSHA cited nearly 1,500 alleged violations of federal electrical, crane - safety, record - keeping and other requirements.
A second citation covering the company's Clairton, Pa., coke works involved more than 200 alleged violations of electrical - safety and other requirements, for which OSHA proposed $1.2 million *U* in fines *T*-1.
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said, "The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched *-1 only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which *T*-14 resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health, and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed * *PRO* to remove those hazards."
OSHA said 0 there have been three worker fatalities at the two plants in the past two years and 17 deaths since 1972.
Gerard Scannell, the head of OSHA, said 0 USX managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years, "yet have failed *-1 to take necessary action *PRO* to counteract the hazards."
"Particularly flagrant," Mrs. Dole said 0 *?*, "are *T*-1 the company's numerous failures *PRO* to properly record injuries at its Fairless works, in spite of the firm promise 0 it had made *T*-3 in an earlier corporate - wide settlement agreement *PRO* to correct such discrepancies."
That settlement was in April 1987.
A USX spokesman said 0 the company hadn't yet received any documents *ICH*-1 from OSHA regarding the penalty or fine.
"Once we do, they will receive very serious evaluation," the spokesman said *T*-1.
"No consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees."
USX said 0 it has been cooperating with OSHA since the agency began *-1 investigating the Clairton and Fairless works.
He said that, if and when safety problems were identified *-15 *T*-1, they were corrected *-16.
The USX citations represented the first sizable enforcement action taken * by OSHA under Mr. Scannell.
He has promised stiffer fines, though the size of penalties sought * by OSHA have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year.
"The big problem is that USX management has proved *-1 unwilling *PRO*-2 to devote the necessary resources and manpower to *PRO* removing hazards and to *PRO* safeguarding safety and health in the plants," said *T*-3 Linda Anku, OSHA regional administrator in Philadelphia.
USX has 15 working days 0 *PRO* to contest the citations and proposed penalties, before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission *T*-1.
Before the USX case, OSHA's largest proposed fine for one employer was $4.3 million *U* for alleged safety violations at John Morrell & Co., a meatpacking subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.
The company is contesting the fine.
INTENSIVE AUDITS are coming to 55,500 taxpayers as research guinea pigs.
This is the year: Unsuspecting filers of 1988 personal returns are being picked randomly for thorough audits *PRO* to help the IRS update its criteria for enforcement, audit selection, and use of resources.
The last Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program survey covered 1985 returns.
The 1988 - return project starts Jan. 1 and is *-1 to be done *-240 by May 31, 1991.
Specially trained IRS agents will look for under - reported income and unsupported deductions and credits.
The agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as marital status and dependents; they want *PRO*-1 to look at living standards and business assets.
But they also are *-1 to see that taxpayers get all allowable tax benefits and to ask if filers who *T*-279 sought IRS aid were satisfied with it.
Courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to TCMP audits, but the IRS will excuse from the fullscale rigors anyone who *T*-1 was audited *-241 without change for either 1986 or 1987.
Rewards have been suggested *-2--but never adopted *-2--for filers who *T*-280 come through TCMP audits without change.
PENALTY OVERHAUL is still likely, congressional sources say 0 *T*-1.
Long - debated proposals *PRO* to simplify the more than 150 civil penalties and make them fairer and easier 0 *PRO* to administer *T*-1 are in the House tax bill.
But they were stripped *-242 from the Senate bill after staffers estimated 0 penalty revenue would fall by $216 million *U* over five years.
Still, congressional aides say 0 penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment, even if not this time around, although some provisions may be modified *-243.
Sen. Pryor (D., Ark.), a leader on the issue who *T*-281 generally backs the House plan, wants some changes--for one, separate sanctions for negligence and large misstatements of tax owed *, not a single penalty.
He would ease the proposed penalties for delayed payroll - tax deposits and for faulty Form 1099 and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily *T*-282.
The General Accounting Office urges Congress *PRO*-1 to ensure that all penalties retain their force as deterrents.
TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS are defined *-244 by a growing number of states.
The 1988 tax act created a federal bill of rights spelling out IRS duties *PRO* to protect taxpayers' rights in the assessment and collection of taxes.
States are following suit.
California enacted a rights law in 1988.
In 1989, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Oregon and South Carolina have adopted rights laws, the Federation of Tax Administrators, a state officials' group, reports 0 *T*-1; the features vary.
And taxpayer groups are urging legislation in many other states.
One group is the Committee on State Taxation, which *T*-283 comprises 330 multistate corporations and advises the Council of State Chambers of Commerce.
The group's Mark Cahoon says 0 its efforts begun * in 1989 have led to the introduction of bills *ICH*-3 *PPA*-1 in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado 0 *T*-2 to establish evenhanded procedures affecting all kinds of taxpayers.
The group also seeks uniformity among states in provisions for taxpayers' rights.
This week, New York City announced a 10 - point policy patterned * on the federal bill of rights for taxpayers.
THE MILEAGE RATE allowed * for business use of a car in 1989 has risen to 25.5 cents a mile for the first 15,000 from 24 cents in 1988, the IRS says 0 *T*-1; the rate stays 11 cents for each added mile.
Also unaltered: 12 cents for charitable activities and nine cents for medical and moving costs.
IRA BALANCES could be used *-1 *PRO* to qualify for bank services under a bill entered * by Reps. Chandler (R., Wash .) and Andrews (D., Texas).
The bill would thwart a recent Labor Department opinion that *PRO* investing individual - retirement - account funds *PRO* to earn free checking violates the law.
HUGO FELLED vast timberlands.
South Carolina's congressional delegation has entered Senate and House bills 0 *T*-1 to provide special casualty - loss treatment and other tax relief for timber growers in the hurricane disaster areas.
HE RODE HIS HOBBY, but he couldn't milk it, the Tax Court says 0 *T*-1.
The court often weighs deductions of sideline - business costs: Do they stem from a profit - seeking activity or a nondeductible hobby?
But it *EXP*-4's rare *PRO* to see both functions in one case.
Charles O. Givens of Mount Vernon, Ind. - investment broker, ex-accountant, and son of a former stable owner - bred Tennessee Walking Horses for six years, raised cattle for four, and never made a profit on either.
He claimed losses totaling $42,455 *U*--and the IRS denied them all.
Special Judge Galloway noted that Givens managed horse - breeding in a businesslike way: He kept detailed accounts, practiced soil conservation, enhanced his experience by *PRO*-1 consulting experts, spent several hours a day *PRO*-1 doing chores, and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died *T*-2.
Yet he took little businesslike care with his cattle: He had no prior experience and didn't seek business counsel about them.
The judge said 0 Givens may deduct his $30,180 *U* of losses from horse breeding, but rejected the $12,275 *U* in deductions from the cattle operation.
BRIEFS:
The IRS already is doing intensive TCMP audits of 19,000 returns for 1987 and fiscal 1988 filed * by corporations with under $10 million *U* in assets....
President Bush says 0 he will name Donald E. Kirkendall to the new Treasury post of inspector general, which *T*-284 has responsibilities for the IRS....

American Brands is a consumer products company with core businesses in tobacco, distilled spirits and life insurance.
As of Sept. 30, American Brands had 95.2 million shares outstanding.

The amendment, offered * by Rep. Douglas Bosco (D., Calif.), was approved *-1 283 - 132 during debate on a bill designed *PRO* to strengthen the Transportation Department's authority in *PRO* dealing with leveraged buy - outs of airlines.
The bill would require the agency *PRO*-1 to block the acquisition of 15% or more *U* of an airline's stock if the purchase threatened safety, reduced the carrier's ability *PRO* to compete, or put the airline under foreign control.
Debate on the legislation, which *T*-238 faces a veto threat from President Bush, is *-1 to continue today.
The amendment would require the department *PRO*-241 to block the purchase of a major airline by anyone who *T*-239 has run two or more carriers that *T*-240 have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
In 1983, Texas Air's Continental Airlines filed for bankruptcy.
Earlier this year, Texas Air's Eastern Airlines filed for bankruptcy.
"This ought *PRO*-2 to be subtitled *-3 *PRO*-242 the ` *PRO* Don't let Frank Lorenzo take over another airline' amendment," said *T*-1 Rep.

Du Pont Co., Hewlett - Packard Co. and Los Alamos National Laboratory said 0 they signed a three - year, $11 million *U* agreement *PRO* to collaborate on superconductor research.
The collaboration will include at least 25 researchers and will be aimed *-2 primarily at *PRO* developing thin films of high - temperature superconductors for use in electronics, the companies said 0 *T*-1.
The materials, discovered * during the past three years, conduct electricity without resistance and promise smaller, faster computers and other new technologies.
Joint - research programs have proliferated as U.S. companies seek *PRO*-1 to spread the risks and costs of *PRO* commercializing new superconductors and to meet the challenges posed * by foreign consortia, especially in Japan.
The latest research pact bolsters Du Pont's growing portfolio of investments in superconductors.
The Wilmington, Del., chemicals concern previously signed research superconductor agreements with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and with Argonne National Laboratory.
Last year, Du Pont agreed *PRO*-1 to pay $4.5 million *U* for rights to superconductor work at the University of Houston.
Hewlett - Packard is a Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker.

A federal judge ruled that Imelda Marcos wasn't brought *-2 to the U.S. against her will and that marital privileges, which *T*-234 protect spouses from *PRO*-1 incriminating each other, don't apply in her case.
As a result, Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos *PRO*-2 to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents 0 she may have filed *T*-1 in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence.
Mrs. Marcos had claimed that she didn't have *-1 to turn over the documents because she was brought *-204 here involuntarily and because *PRO* providing the materials would violate her marital privilege.
In 1988, a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand Marcos, the ousted president of the Philippines, fled the Philippines for Hawaii, they were charged *-205 with racketeering, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $100 million *U* from their homeland *T*-1.
Much of the money was fraudulently concealed *-2 through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate, federal prosecutors have charged 0 *T*-1.
Mrs. Marcos's trial is expected *-1 to begin in March.
U.S. law requires criminal defendants *PRO*-1 to turn over foreign documents such as those sought * in the Marcos case.
The law is meant *-1 to overcome delays caused * by defendants' use of foreign procedures *PRO* to block U.S. requests for records, Judge Keenan said 0 *T*-3 in his opinion.
For instance, the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts.
The U.S. has charged that the Marcoses' alleged crimes involved bank accounts in the Philippines, Hong Kong, the U.S. and other countries.
On the allegation of kidnapping, Judge Keenan wrote, "The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought *-206 to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation."
The judge also said 0 the two marital testimonial privileges cited * by Mrs. Marcos don't apply.
The first one permits a witness *PRO*-1 to refuse *PRO*-2 to testify against her spouse.
But Judge Keenan said 0 that privilege's purpose is "fostering harmony in marriage."
Because Mr. Marcos died Sept. 28, the privilege can no longer apply, the judge said 0 *T*-1.
The second marital privilege cited * by Mrs. Marcos protects confidential communications between spouses.
But Judge Keenan said 0 that privilege is meant *-1 to protect private utterances--not litigation papers filed * with foreign governments, as Mrs. Marcos's attorneys maintained *?*.
Though Judge Keenan threw out most of Mrs. Marcos's objections, he agreed with one of her concerns: that *PRO* turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant's constitutional right against self - incrimination.
As a result, he said 0 he will examine the Marcos documents sought * by the prosecutors *PRO*-1 to determine whether *PRO* turning over the filings is self - incrimination.
Judge Keenan also directed the prosecutors *PRO*-1 to show that Mrs. Marcos's Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination won't be violated *-207.
Mrs. Marcos's attorney in New York, Sandor Frankel, declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the ruling.
Mrs. Marcos hasn't admitted that she filed any documents such as those sought * by the government.
Charles LaBella, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the Marcos case, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
U.S. . AND BRITISH LAW FIRMS announce rare joint venture in Tokyo.
Sidley & Austin, a leading Chicago - based law firm, and Ashurst Morris Crisp, a midsized London firm of solicitors, are scheduled today *-208 *PRO*-209 to announce plans *PRO* to open a joint office in Tokyo.
The firms will be registered *-209 under Japanese law as foreign legal consultants and their practice with Japanese clients will be limited *-210 to *PRO* advising them on matters of foreign law.
The office may also be able *PRO*-1 to advise foreign and multinational clients on international law and general matters.
The office will provide "one - stop shopping" for Japanese financial institutions and other clients seeking advice on access to the world capital markets, according to A. Bruce Schimberg, Sidley's senior banking specialist, who *T*-235 will move to Tokyo from Chicago *PRO*-1 to open the office next year.
The Sidley - Ashurst venture will also be staffed *-211 by another Sidley partner specializing in corporate law, a partner from Ashurst concentrating on acquisitions and a Japanese attorney.
The office will tap the resources of Sidley's 700 lawyers in the U.S., London and Singapore as well as the 400 Ashurst staff members in London and Brussels.
Ashurst is new to the Far East.
Sidley will maintain its association with the Hashidate Law Office in Tokyo.
THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS said 0 it will seek a rehearing of a U.S. appellate court ruling against the union's claim that the state of Michigan engages in wage - discrimination against female employees.
A three - judge panel of the court in Cincinnati made the ruling Saturday.
The UAW is seeking a hearing by the full 14 - judge panel.
The union sued the state in November 1985, *PRO*-1 alleging that it intentionally segregated job classifications by sex and paid employees in predominantly female jobs less than males in comparable jobs.
The UAW also charged that the state applied its own standards for *PRO* determining pay in a discriminatory manner.
In November 1987, a district court judge in Detroit ruled against the UAW.
The union is the bargaining representative for more than 20,000 Michigan state employees.
NEW JERSEY MERGER:
One of the largest law firms in central New Jersey has been created *-212 through the merger of Norris, McLaughlin & Marcus, a 41 - lawyer firm, and Manger, Kalison, McBride & Webb, a health - care specialty law firm with 14 lawyers.
Norris McLaughlin is a general - practice firm that *T*-236 has expanded recently into such specialties as banking, labor and environmental work.
The merged firm will carry Norris McLaughlin's name.
DRUG WARS:
A Texas legislator proposes *PRO* color - coding drivers' licenses of some drug offenders.
The bill would authorize courts *PRO*-1 to order the licenses as a condition of probation.
State Senator J.E. "Buster" Brown, a Republican who *T*-237 is running for Texas attorney general, introduced the bill.
He said 0 an altered license would be an "embarrassment" to teenagers and young adults and would act as a deterrant to drug use.
Richard Avena, executive director of the Texas Civil Liberties Union, called the proposal "*PRO*-2 political gimmickry," and said 0 it fails *-1 to recognize the drug problem as a health issue.
One of Ronald Reagan's attributes as President was that he rarely gave his blessing to the claptrap that *T*-25 passes for "consensus" in various international institutions.
In fact, he liberated the U.S. from one of the world's most corrupt organizations--UNESCO.
This is the U.N. group that *T*-26 managed *PRO*-1 to traduce its own charter of *PRO* promoting education, science and culture.
Ever since, the remaining members have been desperate for the United States to rejoin this dreadful group.
Now UNESCO apologists are lobbying President Bush *PRO*-1 to renege on President Reagan's decision *PRO* to depart.
But we can think of many reasons 0 *PRO* to stay out *T*-1 for the foreseeable future and well beyond.
The U.S., along with Britain and Singapore, left the agency when its anti-Western ideology, financial corruption and top leadership got out of hand *T*-1.
The personal antics of agency Director Amadou - Mahtar M'Bow *ICH*-5 drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered *-2 as KGB plants and ejected *-2 from France *T*-1 and when a mysterious office fire was set *-12 just before Congress sent accountants 0 *T*-4 to trace U.S. funds *T*-3.
Mr. M'Bow was an extreme case, but even his replacement, the more personally genial Spanish biochemist Federico Mayor, has had little success at *PRO*-1 achieving reforms.
Several ridiculous projects *ICH*-1 continue, including the "New International Economic Order," which *T*-27 means redistributionism from the West 0 *T*-2 to pay for everyone else's statism.
The Orwellian "New World Information Order" would give government officials rights against the press; journalists would be obliged *-1 *PRO*-29 to kowtow to their government, which *T*-28 would have licensing and censorship powers and, indeed, duties *PRO* to block printing of "wrong" ideas.
UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into "peoples' rights."
Million - dollar conferences *ICH*-2 were held *-13 0 *T*-1 to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations."
The agency was so totally subverted *-1 from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that *T*-29 seemed *-30 so congenial to them.
Glasnost may be partly responsible, but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted, "The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO."
UNESCO is now holding its biennial meetings *ICH*-2 in Paris 0 *T*-1 to devise its next projects.
Mr. Mayor's hope that references to "press freedom" would survive *PRO*-1 unamended seems *-3 doomed to failure; the current phrasing is "*PRO* educating the public and media *PRO*-2 to avoid manipulation."
He hasn't been able *PRO*-1 to replace the M'Bow cabal.
Soviets remain in charge of education programs, a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture, and a hard - line Polish communist in exile directs the human - rights and peace division.
Of the agency's 2,750 staff members, 230 *T*-1 are in the field *PRO*-2 working on actual projects, such as literacy and oceanographic research.
The position of the United States, which *T*-30 once contributed 25% of the budget, is that nothing has changed.
John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told Congress that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make *PRO* rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely."
This hasn't much bothered the UNESCO delegates, who *T*-31 last week couldn't even agree *PRO*-2 to raise funds by *PRO*-3 selling off a fancy 19th - century French chateau 0 the agency somehow owns *T*-1.
Other countries, including West Germany, may have a hard time *PRO* justifying continued membership.
We see an even stronger argument against UNESCO than its unsurprising failure to reform.
This is that the Reagan Revolution spanning Eastern Europe and Tiananmen Square shows the power of ideas unencumbered by international civil servants or government functionaries.
Free markets, free minds and free elections have an appeal that *T*-32 seems *-1 to get muddled *-3 only when *PRO* delivered *-4 through U.N. organizations--which of course *T*-33 are made *-5 up largely of governments that *T*-34 fear these principles at home *T*-2.
The Babelists of the United Nations are experts at obfuscation.
This can have its purposes at times, but there's no reason 0 *PRO* to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice *T*-1.
We can see plenty of reasons 0 *PRO* to stay out *T*-1, and none 0 *PRO* to rejoin UNESCO *T*-2.
MCI Communications Corp. said 0 it received a three - year contract valued * at more than $15 million *U* 0 *T*-1 to provide network, credit - card and other telecommunications services to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
International Lease Finance Corp. announced a leasing contract with charter carrier American Trans Air Inc., in a transaction involving six Boeing Co. 757 - 200s.
The value of the jets, including spares, is in excess of $250 million *U*.
Two of the 757 - 200s are new aircraft 0 *T*-1 to be delivered *-78 to American Trans Air, the main subsidiary of Amtran Inc., in December 1991 and January 1992.
Four of the planes were purchased *-79 by International Lease from Singapore Airlines in a previously announced transaction.
Delivery of the first aircraft is set *-3 for early November, a second for December and two for April 1990.
Canada's gross domestic product rose an inflation - adjusted 0.3% in August, mainly as a result of service - industry growth, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said 0 *T*-1.
The August GDP was up 2.4% from its year - earlier level.
GDP is the total value of a nation's output of goods and services.
Statistics Canada said 0 service - industry output in August rose 0.4% from July.
Output of goods - producing industries increased 0.1%.
Separately, Statistics Canada reported that its industrial - product price index dropped 0.2% in September, its third consecutive monthly decline.
It also reported a 2.6% decline in its raw - materials price index for September.
Martin Marietta Corp. said 0 it won a $38.2 million *U* contract *ICH*-2 from the U.S. Postal Service 0 *T*-1 to manufacture and install automated mail - sorting machines.
Under terms of the three - year contract, Martin Marietta said 0 it will make and install 267 of the new machines at 156 postal offices.
The new machines are capable of *PRO*-1 sorting by zip code up to 10,000 large flat mail pieces, including magazines and parcels, an hour.
Everything looked good as neurosurgeon Walter Levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman's spinal tumor at the Cleveland Clinic in 1978.
*PRO*-1 Using small electrical shocks applied * to her feet, they were able *PRO*-1 to monitor sensory nerves.
The shocks generated nerve impulses that *T*-306 traveled via spine to brain and showed up clearly on a brain - wave monitor, *PRO* indicating no damage to the delicate spinal tissue.
Then, says *ICH*-1 Dr. Levy, "she woke up *PRO*-2 paralyzed."
The damage was to her motor nerves, which *T*-2 couldn't be monitored *-251 along with the sensory nerves, he explains 0 *T*-1.
The tragedy, he adds 0 *?*, "galvanized me" to look for a way 0 *PRO* to prevent similar cases *T*-2.
Dr. Levy's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe, a device that he and dozens of U.S. researchers are studying *T*-307 with great hope.
Besides *PRO*-1 holding the promise of safer spinal surgery, the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis.
*PRO* Perhaps most exciting, the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain.
The probe, which *T*-308 is painless, non-invasive and apparently harmless, employs strong magnetic fields *PRO*-1 to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain.
If *PRO*-1 positioned over the brain's motor - control area, the hand - held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that *T*-309 zip down motor nerves and activate muscles, *PRO* making, say, a finger twitch.
In principle, they will enable doctors *PRO*-3 to check the body's motor system the way 0 an electrician tests a home's electrical circuits by *PRO*-2 running current through them *T*-1.
"Until now, we've had no objective way of *PRO* measuring motor function," says *T*-1 Keith Chiappa, a neurologist conducting clinical tests with the devices at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital.
"All 0 we could do *T*-1 was tell a patient, ` *PRO* squeeze my fingers as hard as you can *?*' or ` *PRO* raise your arm . '
"Under the best circumstances such tests are subjective; when a patient is unconscious *T*-1, they don't work at all.
Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s, when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets *T*-1.
In the 1960s, Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices 0 *T*-1 to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs.
But for brain tests, the unwieldy machines "would have required patients *PRO*-2 to stand on their heads," says 0 *T*-1 Reginald Bickford, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego.
The field took off in 1985 after scientists at Britain's Sheffield University developed a handy, compact magnet for brain stimulation.
Since then, at least two commercial versions have been put *-252 on the U.S. market, and an estimated 500 have been sold *-253.
In August, a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than 100 researchers, who *T*-310 reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy.
"We don't feel 0 we can use {the devices} routinely in surgery yet, but we're getting close," says *T*-1 Dr. Levy, who *T*-311 is now with the University of Pittsburgh.
A problem, he adds 0 *?*, is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones.
The devices could help *PRO*-1 indicate when surgery would help *T*-2, says 0 *T*-3 Charles Tator, a University of Toronto neurosurgeon.
For example, paralyzed car - crash victims occasionally have some intact spinal tissues that *T*-1, if *PRO*-2 preserved *-3 by emergency surgery, enable partial recovery.
But such operations typically aren't performed *-2 because there is no sign *ICH*-1 right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial.
"The cost {of magnetic stimulators} would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve limb function" in such people, Dr. Tator says 0 *T*-1.
Scientists caution 0 there is a chance 0 the magnet technique might spark seizures in epileptics.
But no significant problems have been reported *-254 among hundreds of people tested * with the devices.
The main sensation, besides *PRO* feeling like a puppet jerked * with invisible strings, is "like a rap on the head," says 0 *T*-1 Sam Bridgers, a neurologist who *T*-313 has studied the brain stimulators at Yale University.
One apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone.
And some doctors who *T*-314 have conducted hours of tests on themselves report temporary headaches.
At least two companies, Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford, Conn., now sell versions of the magnetic devices.
The machines, which *T*-1 at $12,500 *U* are inexpensive by medical standards, haven't been approved *-2 in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for *PRO* stimulating nerves in the hand, legs and other non-brain areas.
Researchers can apply for permission *PRO* to use the probes for brain studies.
At the University of Kentucky, a team led * by Dean Currier, a physical therapy researcher, is testing the stimulators in conjunction with electric shocks *PRO* to induce muscle contractions *PRO* to help *PRO*-1 prevent wasting of thigh muscles after knee surgery.
Similarly, a Purdue University team led * by heart researcher W.A. Tacker hopes *PRO*-2 to develop ways 0 *PRO* to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions *T*-1.
The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts, says 0 *T*-1 Dr. Tacker, whose prototype *T*-2 was dubbed *-255 *PRO*-256 the "Tacker whacker."
The devices' most remarkable possibilities, though, involve the brain.
*PRO* Probing with the stimulators, National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor - control resources after an amputation *T*-1.
Similar studies are expected *-3 to reveal how stroke patients' brains regroup *T*-1--a first step toward *PRO* finding ways 0 *PRO* to bolster that process and speed rehabilitation *T*-2.
Scientists also are exploring memory and perception with the new machines.
At the State University of New York at Brooklyn, researchers flash two groups of different letters on a computer screen in front of human guinea pigs.
Between flashes, certain areas in subjects' brains are jolted *-256 with a magnetic stimulator.
When the jolt is timed *-257 just right *T*-1, the subjects don't recall *PRO*-2 seeing the first group of letters.
"Where does that first stimulus go *T*-1?" exclaims *T*-2 SUNY neurologist Paul Maccabee.
"*PRO* Trying *PRO*-2 to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories," such as precisely where and how the brain processes incoming signals from the eyes *T*-1.
He and others say that the machines are weak enough that they don't jeopardize the memory.
Both the SUNY team and researchers at the National Magnet Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., are working with more potent magnetic brain stimulators.
Among other things, the stronger devices may be able *PRO*-1 to summon forth half - forgotten memories and induce mood changes, neurologists say 0 *T*-2.
The average interest rate rose to 8.3875% at Citicorp's $50 million *U* weekly auction of 91 - day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.337% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $515 million *U* were submitted *-97.
Accepted bids ranged from 8.38% to 8.395%.
Citicorp also said that the average rate rose to 8.0087% at its $50 million *U* auction of 182 - day commercial paper from 7.962% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $475 million *U* were submitted *-98.
Accepted bids ranged from 8% to 8.019%.
The bank holding company will auction another $50 million *U* in each maturity next Tuesday.
Solo woodwind players have *-1 to be creative if they want *PRO*-2 to work a lot, because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited.
The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions *RNR*-2 and splendidly interprets *RNR*-2 fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have *-1 to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again.
Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler, more audience - friendly approach.
Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which *T*-13 won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time."
Today, the pixie - like clarinetist has mostly dropped the missionary work (though a touch of the old Tashi still survives) and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that *T*-14 ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions.
Just the thing for the Vivaldi - at - brunch set, the yuppie audience that *T*-15 has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening.
But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight.
He believes in what he plays *T*-16, and he plays superbly.
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed *PRO* "*PRO*-1 A Musical Odyssey," was a case in point.
It felt more like a party, or a highly polished jam session with a few friends, than a classical concert.
*PRO*-1 Clad in his trademark black velvet suit, the soft - spoken clarinetist announced that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released *-9, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going *-2 to play her favorite tune from the record.
He launched into Saint - Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite.
Then, as if *PRO*-1 to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint - Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that *T*-17 reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality.
And so it went *T*-1 through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that *T*-18 would disturb or challenge a listener.
Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist / bassoonist / composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez.
An improvisational section was built *-10 around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid - back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which *T*-19 gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity *PRO* to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers.
Bach's "Air" followed.
Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by *PRO*-4 proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by *PRO*-4 joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two - part inventions, cleverly arranged * for clarinet and bassoon by Mr. Douglas.
*PRO*-1 Keeping the mood *PRO*-2 light, the two then chanted and chortled their way through some murderous polyrhythms, devised * by Mr. Douglas as an alternative to Hindemith's dry theory - teaching techniques, and then, with Mr. Gomez, soared and improvised on the composer's tight "Bebop Etudes."
The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing - room - only crowd seemed *-2 to be waiting for *T*-1: the pop singer Judy Collins, who *T*-20 appears on "Inner Voices."
*PRO*-2 Glamorous and pure - voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free"--about an encounter with a street - corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto *T*-1--and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace."
"Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.
It was all too mellow 0 *T*-2 to be believed *-11, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled *PRO*-1 to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation.
That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings.
Was this why some of the audience departed *T*-1 before or during the second half?
Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone?
Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening *ICH*-1 just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that *T*-21 juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing.
(Mr. Reich's new "Different Trains" for string quartet uses the technique magisterially.)
Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able *PRO*-1 to take it: He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.
He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that *T*-22 was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.
The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written * by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces.
It *EXP*-1 was enjoyable *PRO* to hear accomplished jazz without *PRO*-2 having *-3 to sit in a smoke - filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy 0 *PRO* to take *T*-4 and ultimately forgettable.
Is this the future of chamber music?
Managers and presenters insist that chamber music concerts are a hard sell, but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged *-1 of threatening elements, served *-1 up in bite - sized morsels and accompanied *-1 by visuals?
What *T*-23's next?
Slides 0 *T*-1 to illustrate Shostakovich quartets?
It was not an unpleasant evening, certainly, thanks to the high level of performance, the compositional talents of Mr. Douglas, and the obvious sincerity with which Mr. Stoltzman chooses his selections *T*-1.
But it was neither deep nor lasting: light entertainment that *T*-24 was no substitute for an evening of Brahms.

The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust said 0 it is considering several ways 0 *PRO* to ease a liquidity crunch *T*-1 that *T*-227 could include the sale of Manville Corp. to a third party.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $765 million *U* will be depleted *-194 next year, and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary *PRO* to meet its obligations.
The trust, which *T*-1 was created *-195 as part of Manville's bankruptcy - law reorganization *PRO* to compensate victims of asbestos - related diseases, ultimately expects *PRO*-2 to receive $2.5 billion *U* from Manville, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims.
Spokespersons for both the trust and the company refused *PRO*-1 to comment on whether any talks with a possible acquirer of Manville had actually taken place.
The trust is considering a sale of its Manville holdings, but Manville has the right of first refusal on any sales of its stock held * by the trust.
Manville, a forest and building products concern, has offered *PRO*-1 to pay the trust $500 million *U* for a majority of Manville's convertible preferred stock.
Manville and the trust are discussing the offer, but no decision has been made *-196.
The filing also said 0 the trust is considering a sale of Manville securities in the open market; an extraordinary dividend on the common stock; or a recapitalization of Manville.
The Soviet Union's jobless rate is soaring to 27% in some areas, Pravda said 0 *T*-1.
It said 0 the situation is caused *-197 by efforts *PRO* to streamline bloated factory payrolls.
Unemployment has reached 27.6% in Azerbaijan, 25.7% in Tadzhikistan, 22.8% in Uzbekistan, 18.8% in Turkmenia, 18% in Armenia and 16.3% in Kirgizia, the Communist Party newspaper said 0 *T*-1.
All are non-Russian republics along the southern border of the Soviet Union, and all but Kirgizia have reported rioting in the past six months.
The newspaper said 0 it is past time 0 for the Soviet Union to create unemployment insurance and retraining programs like those of the West *T*-1.
Pravda gave no estimate for overall unemployment but said 0 an "Association of the Unemployed" *ICH*-1 has cropped up that *T*-2 says 0 the number of jobless is 23 million Soviets, or 17% of the work force.
An 11 - week dispute involving Australia's 1,640 domestic pilots has slashed airline earnings and crippled much of the continent's tourist industry.
"The only people who *T*-228 are flying are those who *T*-229 have *-2 to *?*," said *T*-1 Frank Moore, chairman of the Australian Tourist Industry Association.
He added: "How is a travel agent going *-1 to sell a holiday *T*-3 when he cannot guarantee a return flight *T*-2?"
Transport giant TNT, which *T*-230 owns half of one of the country's two major domestic carriers, said 0 the cost of the dispute had been heavy, *PRO*-1 cutting TNT's profits 70% to $12 million *U* in the three months to Sept. 30.
Brazilian financier Naji Nahas, who *T*-1 was arrested *-198 on Monday after 102 days in hiding, is likely *-2 to be interrogated *-199 next week by the Brazilian judiciary.
Mr. Nahas, who *T*-231 single - handedly provoked a one - day closure of Brazil's stock markets in June when he failed *-2 to honor a debt of $31.1 million *U* owed * to his brokers *T*-1, yesterday blamed his predicament on the president of the Sao Paulo stock exchange; a few days before Mr. Nahas's failure, the exchange raised the required margin on stock - margin transactions.
China's parliament ousted two Hong Kong residents from a panel drafting a new constitution for the colony.
The two, Szeto Wah and Martin Lee, were deemed *-200 unfit because they had condemned China's crackdown on its pro-democracy movement.
The committee is formulating Hong Kong's constitution for when it reverts to Chinese control in 1997 *T*-1, and Chinese lawmakers said 0 the two can only return if they "abandon their antagonistic stand against the Chinese government and their attempt *PRO* to nullify the Sino - British joint declaration on Hong Kong."
NUCLEAR REACTOR FOR ISRAEL?
Israeli officials confirmed that Energy Minister Moshe Shahal and his Canadian counterpart, Jake Epp, discussed a possible Israeli purchase of a $1.1 billion *U* Canadian nuclear reactor for *PRO* producing electricity.
However, a Canadian Embassy official in Tel Aviv said that Canada was unlikely *-1 to sell the Candu heavy - water reactor to Israel since Israel hasn't signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Israel has been accused *-1 in the past of *PRO*-2 using subterfuge *PRO*-3 to seek elements needed * *PRO* to develop nuclear weapons.
The South Korean government is signing a protocol *ICH*-1 today establishing formal diplomatic relations with Poland.
The two are also signing a trade agreement.
South Korean government officials said 0 they don't expect that Seoul can loan money to Warsaw, but it can "offer experience."
Poland is the second Communist nation 0 *T*-1 to recognize the Seoul government; South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary in February 1989.
Venezuela will hold a debt - equity auction Friday, with 32 potential bidders participating.
Earlier this year, Venezuela announced 0 it was opening up debt - equity swaps to foreign investors but said 0 the program would be limited to a net disbursement of $600 million *U* a year.
Friday's auction will be limited to $150 million *U* disbursed * by the Central Bank to potential investors.
The office of foreign investment has authorized some $1.78 billion *U* worth of investment proposals, said 0 *T*-1 Edwin Perozo, superintendent of foreign investment.
Most of the proposals are in tourism, basic industry and fishery and agro - industry projects, he said 0 *T*-1.
Under the debt - equity program, potential investors will submit sealed bids on the percentage of discount 0 they are willing *PRO*-2 to purchase the debt at *T*-1, and the bids will be allocated *-202 based on these discount offers.
The Venezuelan central bank set a 30% floor on the bidding.
A song by American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela was banned *-203 from South African state radio and television.
The South African Broadcasting Corp. said 0 the song "Freedom Now" was "undesirable for broadcasting ."...
Britain's House of Commons passed a law that *T*-3 will force English soccer fans *PRO*-1 to carry identity cards *PRO*-2 to enter stadiums.
The "anti-hooligan" law, which *T*-233 would deprive troublemakers of cards, must be ratified *-2 by the House of Lords and is expected *-2 to become effective early next year.
Five officials of this investment banking firm *ICH*-1 were elected *-69 *PRO*-105 directors: E. Garrett Bewkes III, a 38 - year - old managing director in the mergers and acquisitions department; Michael R. Dabney, 44, a managing director who *T*-100 directs the principal activities group which *T*-101 provides funding for leveraged acquisitions; Richard Harriton, 53, a general partner who *T*-102 heads the correspondent clearing services; Michael Minikes, 46, a general partner who *T*-103 is treasurer; and William J. Montgoris, 42, a general partner who *T*-104 is also senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
The board increased by one to 26 members.
In the past year, one inside director resigned, while three others retired.
People's Savings Financial Corp. said 0 it will buy back as much as 10% of its 2.4 million shares outstanding because the stock is undervalued *-37.
The holding company said 0 it has been "unfairly associated" *-1 with other banks in New England that *T*-62 have had major loan losses in recent quarters.
The company said 0 its People's Savings Bank unit doesn't have a "large exposure to construction and commercial loans that *T*-63 have caused the loan - loss problems in many of the banks.
FIRST AMERICAN FINANCIAL Corp. declared a special dividend of one share of Class B common stock for each share of Class A common stock, payable to holders of record on Nov. 10 if the Securities and Exchange Commission approves this as the effective date of the registration statement.
Shareholders of the Santa Ana, Calif., title - insurance company approved the creation of this second class of stock, which *T*-2 will be traded *-142 on the national over - the - counter market and which the company said 0 *T*-1 would be used *-143 for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.
I had *-3 to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted *PRO*-2 to ride in a montgolfiere *T*-1.
I was a last - minute (*PRO* read interloping) attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken *-64 up entirely by eating, drinking, smoking, sleeping and drinking.
The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt *PRO* to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary.
But as the French embody a Zen - like state of blase when it comes to athletics *T*-1 (*PRO* try *PRO*-2 finding a Nautilus machine in Paris), my fellow conventioners were having none of it.
The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of *PRO* interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning *PRO*-1 to go golfing or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers Montgolfier, French of course, were the world's first hot - air balloonists).
Back in the U.S.A. this kind of chi - chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses.
As in: "You went ballooning??!!
In France??!!"
Americans it seems 0 *?* have followed Malcolm Forbes's hot - air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way.
During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those who *T*-85 have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter - than - air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand, with some estimates running *PRO*-1 as high as 10,000.
Some 30 balloon shows are held *-65 annually in the U.S., including the world's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs--the nine - day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that *T*-86 attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which *T*-1 are fetchingly shaped *-2 *PRO*-3 to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield or a 12 - story - high condom.
(The condom balloon was denied *-66 official entry status this year.)
But in Epinal, a gray 16th - century river town adjacent to France's Vosges mountain region, none of these Yankee - come - lately enthusiasms for things aloft was evident.
Ballooning at the de rigueur hour of 6 a.m. held all the attraction *ICH*-1 for most people of sunrise root - canal work.
*PRO*-1 Feeling the naggings of a culture imperative, I promptly signed up.
The first thing 0 anybody will tell you *T*-1 about ballooning is that it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess, or even a measure of derring - do.
(So long as you don't look down.)
They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon.
(I still say *PRO* don't look down.
At least not when you are ascending *T*-1.)
What they won't tell you *T*-1 is *PRO* not to go aloft in anything 0 you don't want *PRO*-3 to get *T*-2 wet.
I'm not referring to the traditional champagne drenching during the back - on - terra - firma toast.
I'm talking about *PRO* landing in a canal.
In a porous wicker basket.
With a pilot who *T*-87 speaks no English.
To wit, my maiden voyage (and novitiates are referred to *-1 as virgins) began at dawn on a dew - sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field.
(Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk, when the winds are lightest *T*-1.)
In between came lots of coffee drinking while *PRO* watching the balloons inflate and lots of *PRO* standing around *PRO*-1 deciding who *T*-88 would fly in what balloon and in what order (the baskets hold no more than four passengers).
When it wasn't my turn in the balloon *T*-2 I followed its progress from the "chase car," *PRO*-1 listening to the driver holler into a walkie - talkie.
After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of *PRO* drifting above the Vosges *PRO*-1 watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields.
It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's - eye view of the world, even if your pilote in silly plaid beret kept pointing out how "belle" it all was *T*-2.
Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us.
No wonder.
We were coming down straight into their canal.
*PRO* See, the other rule of thumb about ballooning is that you can't steer.
And neither can your pilot *?*.
You can go only up or down (by *PRO*-1 heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which *T*-89 does make the top of your head feel hot) and ride the air currents.
Which *T*-90 makes the chase car necessary.
Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5 - 10 miles an hour.
When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude *T*-1 there is little sense of motion.
Only when one is ascending--or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement--*T*-1 does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket.
"What's he doing *T*-93?" hissed *T*-1 my companion, who *T*-91 was the only other English - speaking member of the convention and whose knuckles *T*-92 were white.
"Attention," yelled *T*-1 our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal.
"You bet attention," I yelled back *?*, *PRO*-1 leaping atop the propane tanks, "I'm wearing alligator loafers!"
Our pilot simply laughed, fired up the burner and with another blast of flame lifted us, oh, a good 12 - inches above the water level.
We scuttled along for a few feet before he plunged us into the drink again.
Eventually we came *PRO*-1 to rest in a soggy patch of field where we had the exquisite pleasure of *PRO* scrambling out of the basket into the mud while the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in *T*-2.
I looked at my watch.
Barely half - an - hour aloft.
Back in the chase car, we drove around some more, got stuck *-1 in a ditch, enlisted the aid of a local farmer 0 *T*-2 to get out the trailer hitch and pull us out of the ditch.
We finally rendezvoused with our balloon, which *T*-94 had come *PRO*-1 to rest on a dirt road amid a clutch of Epinalers who *T*-95 watched us disassemble our craft--another half - an - hour of non-flight activity--that *T*-96 included the precision routine of *PRO* yanking the balloon to the ground, punching all the air out of it, rolling it up and cramming it and the basket into the trailer.
It was the most exercise 0 we'd had *T*-1 all morning and it was followed *-67 by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole.
This meant *PRO* returning to the golf course, where we watched a few French duffers maul the first tee while we sat under Cinzano umbrellas, me nursing an espresso and my ego *T*-1.
A whole morning of ballooning and I had been off the ground barely 30 minutes.
Still, I figured 0 the event's envy - quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerless.
As for the ride back to camp, our pilot and all the other French - speaking passengers clambered into the chase car.
My American companion and I were left *-1 *PRO*-2 to ride alfresco in the wicker basket.
As we streaked by a blase gendarme, I couldn't resist *PRO*-1 rearing up on my soggy loafers and saluting.

Michael Blair, former president and chief executive officer of Enfield Corp., failed *-2 to win election to the company's board at a special shareholder meeting.
Mr. Blair said after the meeting that he had filed separate lawsuits *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 in the Ontario Supreme Court for unjust dismissal against Enfield and for libel against its largest shareholder, Canadian Express Ltd., and two executives of Hees International Bancorp Inc., which *T*-191 controls Canadian Express.
Holders at the meeting elected a full slate of Canadian Express nominees to Enfield's 11 - member board.
Mr. Blair and Hees have been feuding for months.
Yesterday's election was a sequel to Enfield's annual meeting in June when Mr. Blair disallowed proxies in favor of two Hees nominees *T*-1.
The Ontario Supreme Court overturned Mr. Blair's decision.
He later resigned from his executive positions with Enfield, *PRO*-1 saying that actions by its board "amounted to {my} dismissal."
Mr. Blair said 0 his libel suit seeks 10 million Canadian dollars (US$8.5 million *U*) from Canadian Express and Hees executives Manfred Walt and Willard L'Heureux.
He said 0 his suit against Enfield seeks two years severance pay, equivalent to C$720,000 *U*.
Hees and Canadian Express executives couldn't be reached *-176 for comment.
Enfield is a holding company with interests in manufacturing concerns.
It is 38.5% owned *-1 by Canadian Express, another holding company.
Hees is a merchant bank controlled * by Toronto financiers Peter and Edward Bronfman.
All the concerns are based *-1 in Toronto.
Fibreboard Corp. said 0 it completed the previously reported sale of approximately 27,500 acres of timberland near Truckee, Calif., to closely held Sierra Pacific Industries Corp., Arcata, Calif., for $32.5 million *U*.
The lumber, insulation and fireproofing concern said 0 the transaction, which *T*-149 includes a swap of other timber interests, would result in a $13.5 million *U* after - tax gain, 0 *T*-1 to be recorded *-123 in the fourth quarter.
Sales of new cars in Europe fell 4.2% in September from a year earlier and analysts say 0 the market could continue *-1 to soften in the months ahead.
After a stronger - than - *PRO* expected *-1 pace early this year, analysts say 0 the market, after a series of sharp swings in recent months, now shows signs of retreating.
Statistics from 12 countries which *T*-75 normally account for 94% of non-communist Europe's passenger car sales showed 0 new car registrations totaled 911,606 in September, down 21% from August and down 4.2% for the year to date.
The government's primary economic - forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2% in September, but economists said 0 the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing *T*-1.
The small increase in the index of leading indicators, which *T*-1 had climbed 0.5% in August but *T*-1 was unchanged in July, does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably.
However, it doesn't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon.
"I don't think 0 it provides much new information on the economy," said *T*-1 Richard Rippe, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
So far this year, the index of leading indicators has risen in four months, fallen in four months and remained unchanged in the other month.
In another report yesterday, the Commerce Department said 0 sales of new single - family houses plunged 14% in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August.
The declines were particularly pronounced *-2 in the Northeast and in the South, where Hurricane Hugo was a factor *T*-1.
Although September's weakness followed two strong months for home sales, the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market.
The September drop was the largest since a 19% drop in January 1982, but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators.
Because the figures are based *-93 on a small sample, the department said 0 it is 90% confident only that new - home sales fell somewhere between 5% and 23% during the month.
The department also said 0 it *EXP*-1 takes four months *PRO* to establish a trend.
So far this year, 534,000 newly built homes *ICH*-1 have been sold *-94, down 4.5% from the like months of 1988.
The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as *PRO* measured *-1 by the University of Michigan.
This measure had dropped sharply in August.
The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used * *PRO* to calculate the index, the influence of this component has been reduced *-95.
Of the 11 components to the index, only three others *T*-2 *ICH*-1 rose in September: the money supply, the length of the average work week and stock prices.
Several components that *T*-131 track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September.
These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods, lead times on vendor deliveries, orders for new plant and equipment, and backlogs of orders for durable goods.
Meanwhile, the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday 0 a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61% don't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later.
The remainder expect a downturn to begin sometime in
Although manufacturers often are quick *PRO*-1 to call for lower interest rates, 60% of the executives said 0 they would prefer that the Fed keep inflation - fighting as its top priority even if that means higher rates.
The other 40% said 0 the Fed ought *PRO*-1 to worry less about inflation and bring interest rates down.
All the figures are adjusted *-1 *PRO* to remove usual seasonal patterns.
Here are *T*-1 the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
After various adjustments, they produced a 0.5% rise in the index for August and a 0.2% rise for September.
September, and the change from August, are: from 1.11 in the previous month.
Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities.
Of recent note are *T*-1 the activities of the pro - and anti-abortionists, anti-nuclear activists, animal rights protesters, college students concerned about racism, anti-apartheid groups, various self - styled "environmentalists" and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS.
Maybe he didn't start it, but Mohandas Gandhi certainly provided a recognizable beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today.
The Mahatma, or "great souled one," instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India.
Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted...in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment."
I am not a proponent of everything 0 Gandhi did *T*-1, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able *PRO*-2 to participate fully in decisions that *T*-263 vitally affected them.
It *EXP*-1 is difficult, however, *PRO* to justify civil disobedience, non-violent or not, where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box *PRO*-3 to effect change *T*-2.
Where truly representative governments are safeguarded *-232 by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary 0 *T*-2 to construe those rights *T*-1, there is no excuse for *PRO* breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it.
There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it *EXP*-2 is difficult *PRO* to criticize it *T*-1.
The case of Rosa Parks, the black woman who *T*-264 refused *PRO*-1 to sit at the back of the bus, comes to mind as an illustration.
But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign.
The public has a tendency *PRO* to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience.
It *EXP*-1 is true that both are non-violent, but there is a fundamental difference between them.
Lawful demonstrations, such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that *T*-265 do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others, are rights guaranteed * by any truly free system of government.
Civil disobedience, violent or non-violent, is intentional law breaking.
The subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience; but, before we get on with that, *PRO* let me make just a few tangential remarks about lawful demonstrations.
They are useful *PRO*-1 to call public attention to grievances, but they have little value in *PRO* educating anyone about the issues in dispute.
The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted * through bullhorns, militant gestures, accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics.
Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin *T*-1 are lost *-233 in a hostile posture abetted * by superficial media interviews.
At best, demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative; at worst, they can become the stimuli that *T*-266 lead to law breaking.
Demonstrations are particularly apt *-2 to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile *T*-1.
Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism.
Soon the whole purpose of the demonstration is lost *-234 in mob mania.
There are better ways 0 *PRO* to promote a cause *T*-1.
Where non-violent civil disobedience *ICH*-3 is the centerpiece, rather than a lawful demonstration that *T*-267 may only attract crime *T*-2, it is difficult 0 *PRO* to justify *T*-1.
Some find no harm in the misdemeanors of trespass, minor property destruction, *PRO* blocking traffic and the like.
They say 0 these are small prices 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-1 for *PRO* galvanizing action for the all - important cause.
The crimes may appear *-1 small, but the prices can be huge.
Here are *T*-1 two cases 0 *T*-2 to illustrate.
*PRO* Assume a neighborhood demonstration 0 *T*-1 to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car.
The protesters lie down in the street, *PRO*-1 blocking traffic, and will not move until the authorities carry them away.
*PRO* Assume that someone caught * in the jam has a heart attack.
There is no way 0 *PRO* to get an ambulance in quickly *PRO* to move him to a hospital *T*-1.
He dies.
The demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor, but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal.
*PRO* Assume that a TV network is airing a celebrity interview program with a live audience.
The politician appearing is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups.
In a planned protest against his appearance, several members of the studio audience chain themselves in front of the TV cameras in such a way that the program cannot continue.
The network must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige.
The demonstrators have been non-violent, but the result of their trespasses has been *PRO*-1 to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with their dispute.
It might be alleged that TV has done more than its share *PRO* to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience, so the second situation hypothesized * above would be simply a case of "chickens coming home *PRO*-1 to roost."
Or maybe the TV network would lose nothing.
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview the chained protesters.
*PRO* Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that *T*-268 only harms other people indirectly, yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole.
I am referring to those young men who *T*-269 chose *PRO*-1 to disobey their country's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary *PRO*-1 to avoid combat.
Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience, which they tried *PRO*-1 to hide *T*-2 under the cloak of outrage at a war 0 they characterized *T*-3 as "immoral," weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who *T*-270 served honorably in that conflict.
Even more at fault are *T*-1 those leaders in *RNR*-3 and out of *RNR*-3 government who *T*-271 urged and supported their defections, *PRO*-2 thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists.
It *EXP*-3 is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in Vietnam and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine - tuned.
Worse, it *EXP*-4 remained to a well - meaning but naive president of the United States *PRO* to administer the final infamy upon those who *T*-272 fought and died in Vietnam.
Under the guise of "*PRO* healing the wounds of the nation," President Carter pardoned thousands of draft evaders, thus *PRO*-1 giving dignity to their allegations of the war's "immorality."
The precedent having been set *-1, who *T*-273 can complain if future generations called upon * *PRO* to defend the U.S. yield to the temptation *PRO* to avoid the danger of combat by *PRO*-2 simply declaring the war immoral and hiding until it is over?
Finally, I think 0 it *EXP*-1 important *PRO* to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage.
*PRO* Give television a chance *PRO* to cover live any breaking of the law, and no second invitation will be required *-237.
This brings into question the motives of those who *T*-274 lead civil disobedience demonstrations.
Do they want the spotlight for themselves or for their cause?
Here is *T*-1 a good rule of thumb: If the movement produced the leader, the chance that he is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement.
In either case, *PRO* ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by *PRO*-1 watching the act of civil disobedience.
If you have not *?*, it *EXP*-5 is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course.
Mr. Agnew was vice president of the U.S. from 1969 until he resigned in 1973.
W. Ed Tyler, 37 years old, a senior vice president at this printing concern, was elected *-8 *PRO*-9 president of its technology group, a new position.
A bitter conflict with global implications has erupted between Nomura Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan, two of the world's most powerful financial companies.
The clash is a sign of a new toughness and divisiveness in Japan's once - cozy financial circles.
Not only are Japan's financial institutions putting their enormous clout to work; increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion.
Already, the consequences are being felt *-24 by other players in the financial markets--even governments.
What *T*-42 triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue.
Nomura was attempting *PRO*-1 to organize the 50 billion - yen ($352 million *U*) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led * by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government *PRO*-26 to help them recover loans made * to a defunct investment bank that *T*-3 had been owned *-25 by New Zealand's civil - service pension fund *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Unwilling *PRO*-2 to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid *-26, most banks refused *PRO*-1 even to play administrative roles in the new financing, *PRO*-1 forcing an embarrassed Nomura *PRO*-27 to postpone it this week.
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans.
Aside from Nomura's injured pride, the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government.
*PRO*-1 Barred *-3 by its budget law from *PRO*-4 making any new domestic bond issues, Wellington's Debt Management Office had been casting abroad *PRO*-1 to raise the 3 billion New Zealand dollars (US$1.76 billion *U*) to NZ$4 billion *U* 0 it needs *-5 to come up with *T*-2 by the end of its fiscal year next June 30.
With Japan's cash - flush banks aligned *-1 against it, though, *PRO* raising money may be difficult.
Not only can they block Wellington from *PRO*-2 raising money in Japan, bankers here say 0 *?*, but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market, they might be able *PRO*-3 to scuttle borrowings there, too.
New Zealand's finance minister, David Caygill, lashed out at such suggestions.
He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd., an investment bank 80% - owned by the National Provident Fund, and wouldn't bail it out.
"It may very well be what the Japanese banks want *T*-43," he told Radio New Zealand *T*-1.
"I think 0 it would be irresponsible and I am not about *-1 to be blackmailed *-27 by Japanese banks or any other international interests."
No less significant than the Japanese banks' attempt *PRO* to cut off funds *PRO*-2 to pressure a foreign government are *T*-1 the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries.
Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals *PRO* to eventually lower the strict barriers that *T*-44 now separate--and protect--the two industries from each other.
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf, and relations have been at a flashpoint for months.
The banks badly want *PRO*-1 to break into all aspects of the securities business.
Meanwhile, the securities companies--most of them smaller than the banks--are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that *T*-45 wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks.
Nomura, the world's biggest securities company largely by virtue of its protected home field, and Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's most innovative and aggressive bank in capital markets abroad, captain the opposing sides.
And their suspicions of each other run deep.
In the past year, both have tried *PRO*-1 to stretch the limits of their businesses.
Nomura started a credit - card venture *ICH*-2 with American Express Co. that *T*-1 allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account, *PRO*-3 attracting the wrath of banks.
And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that *T*-46 sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that *T*-47 stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms.
The New Zealand bond issue simply has brought the two institutions face - to - face.
Coca - Cola Co., *PRO*-1 aiming *PRO*-2 to boost soft - drink volume in Singapore, said 0 it is discussing a joint venture with Fraser & Neave Ltd., its bottling franchisee in that country.
The venture would be the latest in Coke's rapid expansion of overseas investment.
So far this year, it has put nearly $700 million *U* into bottling operations in Australia, New Zealand and France.
The move also reflects Coke's eagerness *PRO* to have a hand in *PRO* developing the soft - drink markets in Pacific Basin countries.
Aside from Europe, the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years 0 *T*-2 to come *T*-1.
That's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area *T*-1, it sees an economic and demographic gold mine.
In countries such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, economies are growing, *PRO* resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use *T*-111 for soft drinks.
And unlike Europe and the U.S., where populations are aging *T*-1, the Pacific Basin countries have growing proportions of youths--the heaviest consumers of Coca - Cola and other sodas.
A Coca - Cola spokesman said 0 it is too early *PRO* to say how the joint venture would be structured *-2 *T*-1, or how much the company would invest *T*-3 in the transaction.
In the past, however, Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures.
By *PRO*-1 acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas, Coke has been able *PRO*-1 to improve bottlers' efficiency and production, and in some cases, marketing.
Coke has tended *-1 to increase its control when results were sluggish in a given country *T*-2.
That doesn't appear *-1 to be the case in Singapore, a country of about three million people with a relatively high soft - drink consumption rate--a key indicator of Coke's success in a market.
In Singapore, per - capita consumption is about one - third that of the U.S. .
And *PRO* combining Fraser & Neave's own soft drinks with Coca - Cola's gives the Singapore company more than half the share of the soda market there, Coke said 0 *T*-1.
Fraser & Neave, which *T*-1 also has interests in packaging, beer and dairy products, holds the Coke licenses for Malaysia and Brunei, where per - capita consumption isn't as high as in Singapore *T*-2.
Coke could be interested in *PRO*-1 more quickly developing some of the untapped potential in those markets.
A Coke spokesman said 0 he couldn't say whether that is the direction of the talks.
Coke said 0 the joint - venture arrangement, which *T*-112 needs approval from both companies' boards, should be completed *-82 early next year.
EG&G Inc. said 0 it acquired Laboratorium Prof. Dr. Berthold, a German maker of scientific instruments.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The Wellesley, Mass., maker of scientific instruments and electronic parts said 0 Berthold expects 1989 sales of more than 100 million Deutsche marks ($54.5 million *U*) and employs about 400 people.
Berthold is based *-1 in Wildbad, West Germany, and also has operations in Belgium.
John M. Kucharski, EG&G's chairman and chief executive, said 0 the acquisition "will extend EG&G's core technologies, strengthen its position in the European Economic Community and assure a strength and presence in the Eastern European market."
He said 0 it especially will strengthen the company's efforts in the rapidly growing field of bio-analytical instrumentation, and in applied nuclear physics.
Separately, EG&G said 0 it sold most of its Mason Research Institute subsidiary to Transgenic Sciences Inc., a closely held biotechnology company based * in Worcester, Mass.
The sale, for $7 million *U* in cash and securities, will leave EG&G with a 12% stake in Transgenic, executives said 0 *T*-1.
Mason is the largest toxicology lab in New England, with annual revenue of $8 million *U* and 140 employees.
Mason serves commercial and government customers, including the National Institutes of Health.
The combined companies will become profitable by January 1990, said 0 *T*-1 James P. Sherblom, Transgenic's chairman and chief executive officer.
Gov. George Deukmejian and key legislators agreed *PRO*-1 to back a temporary one - quarter - cent increase in the state sales tax *PRO*-2 to raise $800 million *U* for repairs and relief associated * with last month's earthquake.
The tax increase, which *T*-1 will be considered *-238 at a special session of the state legislature that *T*-275 begins tomorrow, would cover only part of the estimated $4 billion to $6 billion *U* in total damage caused * by the Oct. 17 quake.
Aside from as much as $3.45 billion *U* in recently approved federal aid, the state is expected *-1 to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that *T*-276 currently stands at an estimated $700 million *U*.
"I am not aware that there is anything but bipartisan agreement for the general outline" of the revenue - raising plan, said 0 *T*-1 a spokesman for the governor, after a Monday meeting with legislative leaders over the quake - relief question.
The tax increase--on top of the current six - cent per dollar sales tax--would become effective this Dec. 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1990.
The sales - tax plan was preferred *-239 over an alternative that *T*-277 would have boosted the state gasoline tax.
Some legislators expressed concern that a gas - tax increase would take too long and possibly damage chances of a major gas - tax - increasing ballot initiative that voters will consider *T*-278 next June.
Time Warner Inc. and Sony Corp. may be today's public enemies, but the two entertainment giants could end up *PRO*-1 becoming partners in a number of ventures as part of a settlement of their acrimonious legal dispute over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters.
The Warner Bros. studio and Sony signaled 0 they are close to a settlement yesterday, *PRO*-1 asking a Los Angeles Superior Court *PRO*-2 to postpone a hearing scheduled * for tomorrow on Warner's request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from *PRO*-3 taking the top posts at Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
In separate statements, the two sides said 0 they want *PRO*-1 to have "further discussions."
Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber - Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued * at more than $5 billion *U*.
Warner Communications Inc., which *T*-1 is being acquired *-182 by Time Warner, has filed a $1 billion *U* breach - of - contract suit against Sony and the two producers.
Warner has a five - year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that *T*-200 requires them *PRO*-201 to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio.
The two sides in the legal battle have hurled accusations of duplicity at each other for weeks, and both Warner and Sony have accused each other of *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to sabotage each other's prospects for success in the entertainment business.
But it may amount to little more than posturing; the two have continued on - again, off - again settlement talks over the last few weeks, and people familiar with the talks say 0 the matter could be resolved *-183 within a week.
Both Warner and Sony declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the terms of the settlement discussions.
But the people familiar with the talks said that Warner isn't expected *-1 to get any cash in the settlement.
Instead, Sony is likely *-1 to agree *PRO*-2 to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony's CBS Records unit.
Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company, but it doesn't have a powerful world - wide record club like CBS.
The two sides are also discussing certain business ventures involving cable rights to Columbia's movies.
In addition, Sony is expected *-1 to agree *PRO*-2 to swap Columbia's 35% stake in the sprawling Burbank, Calif., studio that Warner and Columbia share *T*-3, in exchange for the old MGM studio lot that Warner acquired *T*-201 with the purchase of Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
Still, it *EXP*-2 may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything, in the wake of sworn affidavits filed * over the last week.
One, for example, came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff, who *T*-202 will head a committee that *T*-203 will oversee Sony's entertainment division, including both records and movies.
In his affidavit, Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of *PRO*-2 having an "antiSony, anti-Japanese bias" and said that Mr. Ross had tried *PRO*-1 to talk him out of *PRO*-3 letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason.
Mr. Ross, who *T*-204 will be chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner after the merger is complete, denied that in his own affidavit, and called Mr. Yetnikoff's remarks *PRO*-2 "vicious" and his claims *PRO*-3 "reckless, irresponsible and baseless," *PRO*-1 saying 0 Warner under his leadership has started a number of businesses in Japan.
Mr. Ross also said 0 he enjoys "warm professional and personal relationships" with Japanese executives including Sony Chairman Akio Morita, "who *T*-205 has visited my home here."
But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff, officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that *T*-206 might yield attractive business opportunities.
Time executives such as the company's president, N.J . Nicholas, who *T*-207 will eventually be co-chief executive of Time Warner alongside Mr. Ross, have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber - Peters duo, and were never directly drawn *-1 into the fray.
Talks between the two sides could unravel, of course, as they have more than once since Sony announced its plans *PRO* to hire Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
But both sides appear *-1 to be more willing *ICH*-2 now *PRO*-3 to meet each other's terms *PRO*-4 to resolve the issue.
And although Warner has said 0 it wanted the producers to fulfill the terms of their contract, the producers said in sworn court declarations that they didn't believe 0 the relationship could be repaired *-184 after the acrimony of the legal battle.
Any settlement is also expected *-1 to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects 0 they were working on *T*-2 at Warner.
The Guber - Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner, including "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "A Bright Shining Lie."
But that doesn't mean 0 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year.
Once a studio chooses *PRO*-1 not to actually make a movie that *T*-208 is in development, producers are typically free *PRO*-2 to take it elsewhere.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters also almost certainly wouldn't be able *PRO*-1 to participate in future sequels to "Batman," the blockbuster hit 0 they produced *T*-2 for Warner.
But in *PRO*-2 acquiring Guber - Peters Entertainment, Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies 0 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce *T*-1.
The two producers own a combined 28% stake in Guber - Peters.
Investors are appealing to the Securities and Exchange Commission *PRO*-1 not to limit their access to information about stock purchases and sales by corporate insiders.
A SEC proposal *PRO* to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the usefulness of information on insider trades as a stock - picking tool, individual investors and professional money managers contend 0 *T*-1.
They make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed * this past summer that, among other things, *T*-1 would exempt many middle - management executives from *PRO*-2 reporting trades in their own companies' shares.
The proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often.
Many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so *RNR*-1 shaken *-2 by the 1987 stock market crash--and the markets already so *RNR*-1 stacked *-3 against the little guy--that any decrease in information on insider - trading patterns might prompt individuals *PRO*-4 to get out of stocks altogether.
"The SEC has historically paid obeisance to the ideal of a level playing field," wrote *T*-1 Clyde S. McGregor of Winnetka, Ill., in one of the 92 letters 0 the agency has received *T*-3 since the changes were proposed *-2 Aug. 17.
"Apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal."
Currently, the rules force executives, directors and other corporate insiders *PRO*-1 to report purchases and sales of their companies' shares within about a month after the transaction.
But about 25% of the insiders, according to SEC figures, file their reports late.
The changes were proposed *-3 in an effort *PRO* to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives "who *T*-1 are really calling the shots," said 0 *T*-4 Brian Lane, special counsel at the SEC's office of disclosure policy, which *T*-2 proposed the changes.
Investors, money managers and corporate officials had until today *-2 to comment on the proposals, and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory, Mr. Lane said 0 *T*-1.
The SEC will probably vote on the proposal early next year, he said 0 *T*-1.
Not all those who *T*-3 wrote oppose the changes.
The Committee on Federal Regulation of Securities for the American Bar Association argues, for example, in its lengthy letter to the SEC, that the proposed changes "would substantially improve the {law} by *PRO*-1 conforming it more closely to contemporary business realities."
What the investors who *T*-4 oppose the proposed changes object to *T*-1 most is the effect 0 they say 0 the proposal would have *T*-2 on their ability *PRO* to spot telltale "clusters" of trading activity--buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time.
According to some estimates, the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third.
The SEC's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates.
The rules will eliminate filings policy - making divisions, such as sales, marketing, finance and research and development, Mr. Lane said 0 *T*-1.
The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required *PRO* to file reports, he said 0 *T*-1.
Companies would be compelled *-1 *PRO*-6 to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who *T*-5 fail *-3 to file reports on time.
*PRO*-1 Considered as a whole, Mr. Lane said 0 *?*, the filings required * under the proposed rules "will be at least as effective, if not more so, for investors following transactions."
But Robert Gabele, president of Invest / Net, a North Miami, Fla., company that *T*-6 packages and sells the insider - trading data, said 0 the proposal is worded *-4 so vaguely that key officials may fail *-1 to file the reports.
Many investors wrote *PRO*-2 asking the SEC *PRO*-3 to require insiders *PRO*-4 to report their purchases and sales immediately, not a month later.
But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who *T*-7 files, the law tells them when *PRO* to do so *T*-1.
Investors who *T*-8 want *PRO*-1 to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress, he added 0 *T*-2.
The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that *T*-9 required insiders *PRO*-10 to file transactions on a more timely basis, he said 0 *T*-1.
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro said 0 its potential losses from *PRO* lending to Iraq could reach 1.175 trillion lire ($872 million *U*), *PRO*-1 marking the bank's first quantification of potential costs of unauthorized lending by its Atlanta branch.
BNL previously reported that its Georgia branch had taken on loan commitments topping $3 billion *U* without the Rome - based management's approval.
State - owned BNL, Italy's largest bank, has filed charges against the branch's former manager, Christopher Drogoul, and a former branch vice president, alleging fraud and breach of their fiduciary duties.
BNL also said that its board had approved "after an in - depth discussion," a letter to the Bank of Italy outlining measures 0 the state - owned bank has taken *T*-2 or plans *PRO*-3 to take *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to improve controls on its foreign branches.
The central bank had ordered BNL *PRO*-1 to come up with a suitable program by yesterday.
Bank of Italy has also ordered BNL *PRO*-1 to shore up its capital base *PRO* to account for potential foreign loan losses, and the Rome bank has outlined a 3 trillion lire capital - raising operation.
BNL was unable *PRO*-1 to elaborate on what measures *T*-2 were planned *-231 by the bank *PRO* to improve controls on its branches abroad.
An imaginative novelist writing a thriller about amateur spy - chasing might invent a Clifford Stoll, but it's unlikely.
It's also unnecessary.
Amateur spy - chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person, or as he might waggishly put it, a surreal person.
He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at *PRO*-1 making computers do his bidding.
He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role *ICH*-1 well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews.
He also is an entertaining writer, *PRO*-2 combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work *T*-1.
In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95 *U*), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts *ICH*-2 over 18 months *PRO* to catch a computer spy.
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused * of *PRO*-1 stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB.
One of them, 25 - year - old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network *PRO*-1 to break into more than 30 high - security computers in the U.S., *PRO*-2 searching for secrets.
He probably didn't penetrate any top - secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing *PRO*-2 to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 *U* for some of the material 0 Hess collected *T*-1.
They promised yet more for really good stuff.
Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of *PRO* laying eggs in the nests of other birds, *PRO*-1 making them surrogate parents.
The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing / electronic mail program called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Gnu - Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created * by AT&T.
*PRO*-1 Using Gnu - Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus "atrun" program for the one that *T*-132 routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes.
Once his cuckoo's egg was laid *-99, he could enter Unix and become a "super-user," with access to everything.
Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran *PRO*-3 low *T*-1 and he was asked *-2 *PRO*-4 to switch to *PRO* helping run the lab's computers *T*-1.
He discovered a 75 - cent discrepancy in the charges made * to various departments for computer time and traced it to a user named *PRO* "*PRO*-134 Hunter," who *T*-133 had no valid billing address.
Mr. Stoll suspected 0 the intruder was one of those precocious students who *T*-134 has fun *PRO*-1 breaking into computers.
But after much tracking, it *EXP*-1 became evident to Mr. Stoll, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California.
*PRO* Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll.
He made a midnight requisition of all the printers 0 he could lay hands on *T*-1 so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers.
After *PRO*-3 discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named *PRO* *PRO*-4 Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, 0 *T*-1 to alert him when Sventek came on the line *T*-2.
Some nights he slept under his desk.
His boss complained about neglect of other chores.
The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used * by the military and national security agencies.
The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets.
When the hacker moved *T*-1, Mr. Stoll moved too, *PRO*-2 calling up other systems managers *PRO*-3 to alert them but keeping his own system open *PRO*-5 *PRO*-3 to avoid *PRO*-4 arousing suspicion.
Sometimes, if the hacker seemed *-1 to be into a sensitive file, he would drag his keychain across the terminal *PRO*-2 to create static or slow the system down *PRO*-3 to frustrate his quarry.
The FBI initially showed little interest, and he had the impression 0 other federal security agencies were tangled *-100 up in legal red tape.
The CIA told him 0 it does not do domestic counterespionage.
One learns a lot *ICH*-1 from this book, or seems *-2 to *?*, about crippling federal bureaucracy.
"*PRO* Seems *-1 to *?*" because it *EXP*-2's possible that the CIA and the National Security Agency were more interested than they let on to Mr. Stoll.
Finally, he got help.
Tymnet is a major network linking computers.
One of its international specialists, Steve White, took a quick interest in Mr. Stoll's hunt, *PRO*-1 ultimately tracing the hacker to West Germany.
The West Germans then took over and finally found Markus Hess.
Eventually, Mr. Stoll was invited *-101 to both the CIA and NSA *PRO*-1 to brief high - ranking officers on computer theft.
He savored the humor of his uncombed appearance among these buttoned - up chaps.
*PRO*-1 Back in Berkeley, he was violently scolded *-1 by a left - wing lady friend for *PRO*-2 consorting with such people.
He became angry in return.
He had developed a hatred for the hacker and a grudging appreciation of the federal "spooks" who *T*-135 make national security their business.
At several different levels, it's a fascinating tale.
Mr. Melloan is deputy editor of the Journal.
ITEL CORP. reported third - quarter earnings, which *T*-48 were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in yesterday's edition *-2 to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
On a pretax basis, Itel's third - quarter earnings of 30 cents a share were actually 7.14% higher than the average of estimates.
Scott C. Smith, formerly vice president, finance, and chief financial officer of this media concern, was named *-91 *PRO*-92 senior vice president.

BELL INDUSTRIES Inc. increased its quarterly to 10 cents from seven cents a share.
The new rate will be payable Feb. 15.

In an Oct. 19 review of "The Misanthrope" at Chicago's Goodman Theatre ("Revitalized Classics Take the Stage in Windy City," Leisure & Arts), the role of Celimene, played * by Kim Cattrall, was mistakenly attributed *-2 to Christina Haag.

As Georgia - Pacific's bid for Great Northern Nekoosa has shown 0 *?*, uninvited takeovers are still alive despite premature reports of their demise.
Therefore, the debate about poison pills will continue *-1 to rage in the boardrooms of corporations and the halls of academia.
Although poison pills come in different colors and shapes, they usually give current shareholders the right *PRO* to buy more stock of their corporation at a large discount if certain events occur--typically, if a hostile bidder acquires more than a specified percentage of the corporation's stock.
However, these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed *-170 at a nominal cost by the corporation's directors if they approve of a bidder.
Supporters of poison pills argue that their adoption forces bidders *PRO*-186 to negotiate with a corporation's directors, who *T*-185 are thereby put *-1 in a better position 0 *PRO* to pursue the long - term interests of the corporation *T*-2.
Recent studies by Georgeson & Co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater stock - price appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years.
Critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by *PRO*-1 letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by *PRO*-1 deterring premium bids from *PRO*-2 ever being made *-171 to shareholders.
These critics are backed *-172 by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run, but also over longer periods.
Institutional investors that *T*-186 must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less *ICH*-1 in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill.
Does this corporation have a high - quality management team with a good track record?
Does this team have a viable strategy for *PRO* improving shareholder values, and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period?
Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy?
If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then institutional investors are likely *-1 to be favorably disposed toward a specific poison pill.
However, the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted *-173, they survive forever.
Although the current management team may be outstanding, who will *T*-187 be the CEO in 10 years?
Although the five - year strategy may be excellent, what will *T*-188 be the strategy in 25 years?
The solution to this problem is a time - limited poison pill.
The limit could range from three years to seven years, depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan.
At the end of this period, the poison pill would be eliminated *-174 automatically, unless a new poison pill were approved *-175 by the then - current shareholders, who *T*-189 would have an opportunity *PRO* to evaluate the corporation's strategy and management team at that time.
One rare example of a time - limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted * by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco.
Pennzoil's poison pill covers five years in order *PRO* to give current management enough time 0 *PRO* to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner *T*-1.
Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted * recently by Pittsburgh - based National Intergroup Inc., a diversified holding company.
The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which *T*-190 owned about 7% of the company's voting stock, worked with management *PRO*-1 to devise a time - limited poison pill.
This pill automatically expires after three years unless *PRO*-1 continued *-2 by a vote of the shareholders.
The attitude of the Wisconsin Investment Board reflects a growing receptivity to time - limited poison pills on the part of institutional investors, as *PRO* shown *-1 by the discussions at recent meetings of the Council of Institutional Investors and my informal survey of several retirement plans with large stock positions.
More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team's strategy.
Such concrete analysis is likely *-1 to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills.

As Yogi Berra might say, it's deja vu all over again.
*PRO*-2 Crouched *-3 at shortstop, Bert Campaneris, once Oakland's master thief, effortlessly scoops up a groundball and flips it to second.
In the outfield, Paul Blair, the Orioles' eight - time Gold Glove winner, elegantly shags a fly.
On the mound, former Red Sox great Luis Tiant, the wily master of 1,001 moves, throws an off - speed strike.
"Babies, kiddies," growls *T*-1 their manager--a fellow named * *PRO*-2 Earl Weaver, who, in a different time, *T*-3 handled four World Series teams and now *T*-3 handles the Gold Coast Suns.
"Old - time kiddies," he says *-2.
Perhaps.
But for the next few months, these boys of summers long past are going *-1 to be reveling in an Indian summer of the soul.
Now that the baseball season is officially over, you see 0 *?*, it's time 0 for a new season to begin *T*-2.
Today is the debut of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a new eight - team pro sports circuit, modeled * after the highly successful senior tennis and golf tours and complete with good salaries, a cable television contract and even expansion plans.
One hundred and ninety two former greats, near greats, hardly knowns and unknowns begin a 72 - game, three - month season in spring - training stadiums up and down Florida.
For everyone involved *, it's one more swig of that elixir of youth, baseball.
"Someone always makes you quit," says *T*-1 legendary St. Louis Cardinals centerfielder Curt Flood, the league's commissioner.
"You feel 0 you want one more--one more at - bat, one more hit, one more game."
Until the baby - faced heroes of today reclaim these ballparks for spring training, there is one more.
And not just for the players.
It's one more for the baseball - loving lawyers, accountants and real estate developers who *T*-50 ponied up about $1 million *U* each for the chance *PRO*-1 to be an owner, to step into the shoes of a Gene Autry or have a beer with Rollie Fingers.
"Nothing can be better than this," says *T*-1 Don Sider, owner of the West Palm Beach Tropics.
Early in the morning Mr. Sider, an estate lawyer, pores over last wills and testaments.
Midmorning, he dons an orange - and - blue uniform and, for fun, may field a bunt from Dave Kingman.
It's one more, too, for the fans who *T*-51 dream of a season that *T*-52 never ends.
"I feel like a little kid," says *T*-1 a gleeful Alex de Castro, a car salesman, who *T*-53 has stopped by a workout of the Suns *PRO*-3 to slip six Campaneris cards *ICH*-2 to the Great Man Himself 0 *T*-4 to be autographed *-30.
The league's promoters hope 0 retirees and tourists will join die - hard fans like Mr. de Castro and pack the stands *PRO*-1 to see the seniors.
The league is the brainchild of Colorado real estate developer James Morley--once a minor - leaguer himself--who *T*-54 says 0 he had the idea last January while *PRO*-1 lying on a beach in Australia.
When he sent letters offering 1,250 retired major leaguers the chance of another season *T*-1, 730 responded.
Eventually, about 250 made the trip to Florida *PRO*-1 to compete for the available slots.
(Players have *-1 to be 35 or older, except for catchers, who *T*-55 are eligible at 32 because life behind the plate is so rough.)
For some players, the lure is money--up to $15,000 *U* a month.
Others, just released * from the majors, hope 0 the senior league will be their bridge back into the big - time.
But as they hurl fireballs that *T*-2 smolder rather than burn, and relive old duels in the sun, it *EXP*-1's clear that most are there *PRO*-3 to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it--or something close to it.
"My fastball is good.
Real good," says 39 - year - old Pete Broberg, *PRO*-1 working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp.
Mr. Broberg, who *T*-56 started with the now - defunct Washington Senators, says that when he left baseball in 1978 *T*-1, he "never looked back."
For a long time, he ignored baseball *ICH*-1 altogether, even the sports pages.
Now Mr. Broberg, a lawyer, claims 0 he'd play for free.
"You can't give it up that easily," he says *T*-1.
"I tried."
The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon, a lean 36 - year - old righthander to take a four - month leave from *PRO* selling insurance in Texas *PRO*-1 to try out for Mr. Weaver's team.
"It doesn't replace *PRO* pitching in the majors, but it proves to me that I would have been able *PRO*-2 to play if I'd stayed healthy," he says *T*-1.
Back in 1975, late in the season, a then - 21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance, five and two - thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox.
He gave up seven hits, walked five and didn't get a decision.
Arm troubles forced him back to the minors the next year.
"There's a satisfaction in *PRO* going against the rules," offers *T*-1 Will McEnaney, once a stopper with Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.
He means the rule that a player can't cut it after a certain age.
These days he hustles to house - painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after *PRO*-1 training with the Tropics.
While *PRO*-1 sipping a beer after practice, he vividly recounts *PRO*-1 getting the Red Sox's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out *PRO*-2 to end the 1975 World Series, and repeating the feat against the Yankees' Roy White in 1976.
Some of the game's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle - aged men attempting a young man's sport.
"I personally don't enjoy *PRO*-1 seeing players who I remember *T*-57 vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies," says *T*-2 Roger Angell, New Yorker magazine's resident baseball sage.
"I feel 0 people should be allowed *PRO*-1 to remember players as they were."
Worse, says *ICH*-2 baseball author Lawrence Ritter, "Someone will get a heart attack and that will be the end of the whole story."
But the ballplayers disagree.
Most are trim.
Some have been training for months; others only recently left active status.
(No one has worked out the players' average age, but most appear *-1 to be in their late 30s.)
And there's pride.
"I'm not going *-1 to look stupid," vows *T*-2 former Pittsburgh Pirate second baseman Rennie Stennett, sweat dotting his brow as he prepares for some practice swings.
"It's going *-2 to be a tough league," promises *T*-1 the 47 - year - old Mr. Campaneris.
"There will be a lot of malice."
Men who *T*-58 have played hard all their lives aren't about *-2 to change their habits, he says *T*-1.
Nonetheless, one can't help *PRO*-1 wonder whether the game will be just a little bit slower.
At the weatherbeaten Pompano Beach municipal stadium, Mr. Blair, the 45 - year - old former Oriole, knows 0 his power isn't what it used *-2 to be *T*-1.
So he adjusts.
He no longer crowds the plate.
He's not thinking about home runs anymore, just base hits.
Still, "how sweet it is *T*-1," he says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 savoring the fat sound of the well - hit line drive that *T*-4 bounces off the center field wall.
And *PRO* don't expect many complete games by pitchers--perhaps three out of 288, laughs 0 *T*-1 Mr. Fingers, the former Oakland reliever.
*PRO* Expect "tricky" stuff from pitchers, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Weaver, the manager.
*PRO* Expect brushbacks but no beanballs, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. McEnaney.
*PRO* Even expect stolen bases, says 0 *T*-1 the wiry and fit Mr. Campaneris: "If you know how *PRO* to slide *T*-3, it's no problem," he says *T*-2.
And *PRO* expect slower fastballs.
"I'm not so young anymore," concedes *T*-1 the cigar - chomping, 48 - year - old Mr. Tiant.
"I won't be throwing 90 mph, but I will throw 80 - plus," he says *T*-1.
White - haired Pedro Ramos, at 54 the league's oldest player and a pitcher - coach with the Suns, has lost even more speed.
*PRO*-1 Stuffing a wad of Red Man into his cheek, he admits 0 the fastball 0 he brought *T*-2 into the majors in 1955 has become a slowball.
Its maximum velocity is 72 mph.
But he isn't worried.
He will compensate with the guile learned * from his years in the majors.
He has good control.
He will keep the ball down, move it around.
After all, he says 0 *?*, "*PRO*-2 Even to make love, you need experience.
Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing conventional - arms talks too quickly, *PRO*-1 creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that *T*-105 could affect the security of Western Europe for years.
Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks--which *T*-1 are aimed *-71 at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons, as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe--also are being registered *-70 at the Pentagon.
Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest.
But some American defense officials believe 0 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time *PRO*-1 to examine the long - term implications of the options being considered *.
For one thing, Pentagon officials, who *T*-106 asked *PRO*-3 not to be identified *-4, worry that the U.S. will have a much tougher time *PRO*-2 persuading Europeans *PRO*-5 to keep some short - range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned *-1 out.
At the same time, they contend that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe.
Allies concerned about the deadline include the British, French and smaller NATO allies, some of whom *T*-107 don't have adequate staffs 0 *T*-1 to provide quick answers to the questions being raised * by what *T*-2 generally are considered *-72 the most complex arms - control talks ever attempted *.
So far, no ally has complained openly, *PRO* preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West's top bargaining priority.
But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left * under the Bush timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What *T*-108 is a tank?"
Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation haven't even been defined *-73.
Tanks currently are defined *-74 as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that *T*-1 carry large guns.
The Soviets complicated the issue by *PRO*-1 offering *PRO*-2 to include light tanks, which *T*-109 are as light as 10 tons.
Oleg A. Grinevsky, the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional - arms talks, argued that this would mean 0 the Soviets would have *-1 to destroy some 1,800 tanks, while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe.
But the issue is stickier than it seems *-1 *?*.
France, Britain and Italy all have light tanks 0 they would like *PRO*-2 to keep *T*-1 out of the talks.
And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed *-75 at *PRO*-1 blocking the U.S. from *PRO*-2 developing lighter, more transportable, high - technology tanks.
*PRO* Defining combat aircraft is even tougher.
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought *-76 into the talks, then argued for *PRO* exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are "solely defensive."
NATO hasn't budged from its insistence that any gun - carrying plane has offensive capability.
The dispute over that issue, according to one U.S. official, is a "potential treaty stopper," and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able *PRO*-1 to resolve it.
Accounting problems raise more knotty issues.
Greece and Turkey, for example, are suspected *-77 of *PRO*-1 overstating their arsenals in hopes that they can emerge from the arms - reduction treaty with large remaining forces 0 *T*-2 to deter each other.
Other nations aren't sure how many weapons they have *T*-1 in their own arsenals.
"It's just going *-2 to be sloppy, both on our side and theirs {the Warsaw Pact's}," says *T*-1 one NATO analyst.
So far, neither the Bush administration nor arms - control experts in Congress seem *-1 moved *-2 by arguments that these problems *ICH*-4 may take more time *ICH*-5 0 *PRO* to thrash *T*-3 out than President Bush has allowed *?*.
They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude.
"So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere?" asks *T*-1 Rep. Norman Dicks (D., Wash.), a member of the House group that *T*-110 visited the talks in Vienna.
"The bottom line is that if we can get that {Warsaw Pact} superiority brought *-1 down to parity, we ought *-2 to keep *-3 pressing ahead as quickly as possible.
I worry more about things becoming so unraveled *ICH*-2 on the other side that they might become unable *PRO*-1 to negotiate.
Hani Zayadi was appointed *-32 *PRO*-62 president and chief executive officer of this financially troubled department store chain, *PRO* effective Nov. 15, *PRO*-32 succeeding Frank Robertson, who *T*-61 is retiring early.

South Korean consumer prices rose 5% in the first 10 months of this year, *PRO*-1 matching the government's target for the entire year, according to the Bank of Korea and the Economic Planning Board.
According to reports released * by the two government agencies, domestic consumer and wholesale prices each rose by 0.2% in October from the previous month.
As a result, consumer prices for the first 10 months of 1989 surged by 5% and wholesale prices by 1.3%.
The South Korean government had been projecting a 5% consumer price increase for the entire year.
*PRO* Buying 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long - term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property.
But in another sense, the $846 million *U* purchase is uncharacteristically nervy, industry analysts say 0 *T*-1.
The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that *T*-192 owns New York's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all - time high *T*-1.
Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer *PRO*-1 to focus on the affinities, *PRO*-1 nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public.
"We think 0 there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says *T*-1 Raymond Pettit, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group.
"On balance, we think 0 it will be positive."
But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that *T*-1 should be avoided *-178 for the time being.
In particular, they criticize the timing, *PRO* coming as it does *?* on the heels of Sony Corp.'s controversial purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
"Officially, yes, we encourage the free flow of direct investment," says *T*-1 a Foreign Ministry official.
"But they didn't have *-1 to choose this particular moment."
During the past year, government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged Japanese companies *PRO*-1 to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in the
Since the mid-1980s, Japan's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai - Ichi Seimei America Corp.'s $670 million *U* purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc.'s $610 million *U* purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986.
In Los Angeles, Arco Plaza was sold *-179 to Shuwa Corp. for $620 million *U* in 1986, and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $300 million *U* for Atlanta's IBM Tower last year.
Altogether, annual Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate grew from about $1.3 billion *U* in 1985 to about $7.1 billion *U* in 1988.
Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties.
Critics say 0 Mitsubishi Estate's decision *PRO* to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated *-2 by the pressure *PRO* to act for the good of Japan *T*-1.
"Those who *T*-1 have no money and *T*-1 aren't buying think 0 it *EXP*-3's right *PRO* to refrain, but those with money who *T*-193 want *PRO*-4 to buy for themselves pay no attention," says *T*-2 an official of the Japan - U.S . Business Council.
But to Mitsubishi Estate, the acquisition has just the elements that *T*-194 should win support from both sides.
First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it *PRO*-2 to buy a majority share *T*-1.
Secondly, the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend *PRO*-1 to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications.
Finally, Mitsubishi Estate has no plans *PRO* to interfere with Rockefeller's management beyond *PRO*-1 taking a place on the board.
"We'll continue *-2 to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company, and we'll rely very much on their leadership," says *T*-1 Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi.
Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate, a company of long history, strong government ties and sound resources.
In asset terms, Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan.
The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district, the business and financial center of Tokyo, often jokingly called *PRO* "*PRO*-1 Mitsubishi Village."
The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that *T*-195 made up the merchants' district *T*-1.
At the time, Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western - style business center.
Mitsubishi built the government's dream development, the story goes 0 *?*, in exchange for the official decision *PRO* to locate Tokyo's central railway station there.
That was just an early step in a relationship with government that *T*-196 has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of "seisho," literally government - business, a title that *T*-197 has the pejorative connotation of *PRO* doing the government's bidding, but also suggests the clout inherent in *PRO* maintaining such close ties.
Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today's Mitsubishi group.
It's known *-1 for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures: In the year ended March 31, 57.4% of its total revenue came from office building management.
Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% *U* annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says 0 *T*-1 Graeme McDonald, an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
For the latest fiscal year, the company's net income jumped a robust 19% to 35.5 billion yen ($250.2 million *U*).
For Mitsubishi Estate, the Rockefeller purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business, the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as Mitsui, which *T*-198 had purchased the Exxon Building *T*-1.
"Japanese companies need *-1 to invest in overseas real estate for diversification," says 0 *T*-2 Yoshio Shima, an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp.
Rockefeller isn't the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate--it has already played a leading role in *PRO* designing Los Angeles's Citicorp Plaza.
But the Rockefeller investment is its largest.
Nonetheless, it will barely make a dent in Mitsubishi Estate's finances, analysts say 0 *T*-1.
Mitsubishi Estate hasn't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase, which *T*-199 are due in cash next April *T*-1, but the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated *-2 to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen.
Moreover, as a member of the Mitsubishi group, which *T*-1 is headed *-180 by one of Japan's largest banks, it *EXP*-2 is sure *PRO* to win a favorable loan.
Analysts say 0 the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants.
Meanwhile, at home, Mitsubishi has control of some major projects.
It is the largest private - sector landowner of the Minato - Mirai 21 project, a multibillion - yen development in the port city of Yokohama, about an hour outside Tokyo.
The project is one of a select group of public projects opened * to U.S. firms under a U.S. - Japan construction trade agreement reached * last year.
The centerpiece of that complex, the Landmark Tower, will be Japan's tallest building when it is completed *-181 in 1993 *T*-1.
Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan *PRO* to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high - tech buildings, a project budgeted * for 30 years and six trillion yen.
As *PRO* expected, Warner Bros . Records said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to form a recorded - music and music - publishing joint venture with former MCA Records Chairman Irving Azoff.
Warner said 0 it will provide financing for the venture, but didn't disclose terms.
Mr. Azoff hasn't named the company yet, but any records 0 it produces *T*-1 will be distributed *-221 by Warner.
Warner is part of Warner Communications Inc., which *T*-256 is in the process of *PRO* being acquired *-222 by Time Warner Inc.
Mr. Azoff resigned as head of MCA Records, a unit of MCA Inc., in September, and *PRO*-1 had been discussing a joint venture with both Warner and MCA.
In a statement yesterday, Mr. Azoff said 0 he chose Warner, the largest record company, because "their standing in the entertainment industry is second to none.
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford defended the Treasury's efforts *ICH*-1 this fall *PRO* to drive down the value of the dollar, *PRO*-2 saying 0 it helped *PRO*-3 minimize damage from the 190 - point drop in the stock market Oct. 13.
*PRO*-1 Testifying before a House subcommittee, Mr. Mulford said that if the Treasury hadn't intervened in foreign - exchange markets in September and early October *PRO*-2 to reduce the dollar's value, the plunge in the stock market might have provoked a steep fall in the currency that *T*-97 might have "unhinged financial markets."
Mr. Mulford, *PRO*-1 responding to critics of intervention, also said 0 intervention is "highly visible," is taken *-3 seriously by financial markets and works better than "*PRO* was recognized *-68 some time ago."
Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention 0 *T*-1 to help *PRO*-2 restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing.
Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, who *T*-98 had dissented from the Treasury's policy, told lawmakers, "I became convinced about what *T*-99 looked to me like an attempt *PRO* to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market."
Intervention, he added 0 *?*, is useful *PRO*-2 only to smooth disorderly markets, not to fundamentally influence the dollar's value.
Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y .) said 0 Mr. Johnson refused *PRO*-1 to testify jointly with Mr. Mulford and instead asked *PRO*-1 to appear after the Treasury official had completed his testimony.
A Fed spokesman denied Mr. LaFalce's statement.
Mr. Mulford said 0 reports of tension between the Treasury and Fed have been exaggerated, *PRO*-1 insisting that they involved "nuances."
Mr. Johnson also said that "in the scheme of things, these things are minor."
On other matters, Mr. Mulford said 0 West Germany is contributing to imbalances in the world economy because of its success as an exporter.
"The solution is stronger domestic growth {in Germany}," he said *T*-1.
But because the growth of the German economy has been stronger than *PRO* expected *-2, Mr. Mulford said 0 *?*, it *EXP*-3's difficult for the U.S. to argue that Germany ought *PRO*-4 to adopt more stimulative monetary and fiscal policies.
Germany's trade surplus is largely with other European countries rather than with the U.S., Mr. Mulford acknowledged 0 *T*-1.
But nonetheless U.S. companies might be more successful in European markets if not for the German export push, he said 0 *T*-1.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it lowered the ratings on about $3.2 billion *U* of Houston Lighting & Power Co.'s securities because of the company's low levels of interest coverage and internal cash generation.
Houston Lighting is a unit of Houston Industries Inc., a utility holding company in Houston.
Downgraded *-1 by Moody's were *T*-3 Houston Lighting's first - mortgage bonds and secured pollution - control bonds to single - A - 3 from single - A - 2; unsecured pollution - control bonds to Baa - 1 from single - A - 3; preferred stock to single - A - 3 from single - A - 2; a shelf registration for preferred stock to a preliminary rating of single - A - 3 from a preliminary rating of single - A - 2; two shelf registrations for collateralized debt securities to a preliminary rating of single - A - 3 from a preliminary rating of single - A - 2, and the unit's rating for commercial paper to Prime - 2 from Prime - 1.
Moody's said 0 Houston Lighting's current situation has some positive aspects, including *PRO* managing "very well" the construction and commercial operation risks of Units 1 and 2 of the South Texas Project nuclear power plant.
Capital requirements will be declining and no new generating facilities will be required *-90 for several years, Moody's said 0 *T*-1.
Many thanks for Alexander Cockburn's comic masterpiece ("U.S. . Economy: A House Built * on Junk - Bond Sand," Viewpoint, Oct. 19).
The use of the abominable construction practices in the Soviet Union--as *PRO* evidenced *-1 by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the Armenian earthquake--as a metaphor for the U.S. economic system was a sublime example of Mr. Cockburn's satirical muse.
I await his sequel: the economic and social resiliency of the San Francisco Bay area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. Cockburn now believes in *T*-1.
It should be a scream.

Northwest Airlines settled the remaining lawsuits filed * on behalf of 156 people killed * in a 1987 crash, but claims against the jetliner's maker are being pursued *-188, a federal judge said 0 *T*-1.
Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc., and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which *T*-220 made the MD - 80 aircraft, also are pursuing counterclaims against each other in the crash near Detroit Metropolitan Airport.
Terms of the settlements for the remaining 145 lawsuits against Northwest weren't disclosed *-1.
A total of 157 lawsuits were filed *-189 on behalf of crash victims.
U.S. District Judge Julian A. Cook Jr. announced the settlements as the jury trial was *-1 to begin yesterday.
He reset opening arguments for today.
The jury will resolve the claims against McDonnell Douglas, Northwest's claim that a defect in the aircraft caused the crash, and McDonnell Douglas' claim that the plane was improperly flown *-1.
The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that pilots failed *-1 to set the plane's wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and failed *-1 to make mandatory preflight checks that *T*-221 would have detected the error.
Also, a cockpit warning system failed *-1 to alert the pilots 0 the flaps and slats were not set *-3 for takeoff, the NTSB said 0 *T*-2.
The only passenger who *T*-222 survived the crash was Cecelia Cichan, then 4, of Tempe, Ariz., whose parents and brother *T*-223 died in the crash.
She now lives with relatives in Alabama.
The Internal Revenue Service said 0 it is willing *PRO*-2 to let the U.S. Tax Court decide how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government *T*-1 after his assets are liquidated *-164.
The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one - time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case.
Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped *-165 of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard * earlier this year in Washington, D.C.
The IRS has been seeking more than $300 million *U* in back taxes from Mr. Hunt.
Separately, a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $65.7 million *U* settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A., another major creditor in the case.
The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $251 million *U* against Mr. Hunt.
In addition to *PRO*-1 turning down the compromise, Judge Harold C. Abramson said 0 he would allow a claim of only $19.7 million *U*.
Minpeco attorneys said 0 they would appeal the decision to a federal district court.
*PRO* Regarding Mr. Hunt's taxes, he and the IRS have apparently agreed on a basic formula for *PRO* liquidating his estate in which the IRS would get 70% of the proceeds from a liquidating trust and 30% would go to other creditors *T*-1.
But they have been at odds over how much Mr. Hunt would owe the government *T*-1 after his assets are sold *-166.
The IRS had demanded $90 million *U* but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $60 million *U*.
Grover Hartt III, a government lawyer, warned that Mr. Hunt stood *PRO*-2 to lose certain oil and gas properties, $200,000 *U* in English pottery, a Colorado condominium and other assets 0 he might have kept *T*-1 if he had settled with the IRS.
"But they wanted *PRO*-2 to roll the dice and we're going *-3 to let them," Mr. Hartt said *T*-1.
Stephen McCartin, Mr. Hunt's attorney, said 0 his client welcomed the gamble.
The Tax Court isn't expected *-1 to rule before early next year.
Now was that a quarter cup or a half cup?
Not a gripping question, unless you're the pastry chef of this city's Chez Panisse restaurant and you've just lost your priceless personal dessert notebook.
Chez Panisse was listed *-112 among the top 30 restaurants in the world this year by Connoisseur magazine.
The tattered black binder, bulging with 18 years' worth of recipes held * together by rubber bands, was in chef Lindsey Shere's purse when it was stolen *-113 from her house recently *T*-2.
The Berkeley police don't have any leads but doubt 0 the crime was driven *-114 by a passion for sweets.
Instead, they figure 0 the culprit probably took money from Ms. Shere's wallet and discarded all the tips in the five - by - eight - inch looseleaf.
Chez Panisse, whose founder, Alice Waters, *T*-3 is considered *-115 the inventor of the cooking style known * as California cuisine and whose patrons *T*-143 make reservations a month in advance, hasn't exactly subjected diners to vanilla ice cream because of the theft.
For one thing, Ms. Shere can draw on her cookbook, published * by Random House four years ago, which *T*-144 is teeming with recipes for such specialties as kiwi sherbet, gooseberry fool (a creamy dish made * with crushed stewed berries) and hazelnut "oeufs a la neige."
For another, sympathetic fans have sent Ms. Shere copies of her recipes clipped * from magazines over the years.
Still, the restaurant's ever - changing menu of five - course dinners--it supposedly hasn't repeated a meal since *PRO*-1 opening in 1971--requires constant improvisation.
And that puts added pressure on Chez Panisse dessert - menu planners.
"We make what we know how *PRO* to make *T*-1 *T*-2," says *T*-3 business manager Richard Mazzera.
Many in the Bay Area's pastry community express disbelief that Ms. Shere kept only one copy of such valuable notes, but she has received moral support from Baker's Dozen, a group of California pastry chefs that *T*-145 meets regularly *PRO*-3 to discuss issues like how *PRO* to keep meringues from weeping *T*-1 and how bovine eating habits affect butter texture *T*-2.
Ms. Shere has offered a $500 *U* reward for the book's return but figures 0 she'll have *-1 to reinvent many recipes from scratch.
"It's an overwhelming job," she says *T*-1.
"There are so many possible proportions when you consider how many things *T*-1 are made *-116 out of eggs and butter and milk *T*-2.
For years, a strict regimen governed the staff meetings at Nissan Motor Co.'s technical center in Tokyo's western suburbs.
Employees wore identification badges listing not only their names but also their dates of hire.
No one could voice an opinion until everybody with more seniority had spoken first, so younger employees--often the most enthusiastic and innovative--seldom spoke up at all.
But in 1986, the badges and the "*PRO* don't speak out of turn" rule were abolished *-215--early steps in a cultural revolution still rolling on with all the subtlety of a freight train.
In recent years, Nissan has instituted flex - time work schedules and allowed employees to dress casually, even in blue jeans.
A rule forbidding staffers *PRO*-1 to own competitors' cars has been lifted *-216, and now many designers drive foreign cars *PRO*-2 to get useful ideas.
Nissan's decades - old corporate song filled * with references to Mount Fuji has been scrapped *-217 in favor of a snappy tune sung * by a popular Japanese vocalist.
And in a Japanese corporate first, Nissan recently opened the first coed company dormitory for single employees at the suburban Tokyo technical center.
"We had lots of internal debate about this one," concedes *T*-1 Tadahiko Fukuyama, a senior public - relations official.
"But in the end, top management decided *PRO*-1 to follow the voice of the younger generation."
This corporate glasnost is a big reason 0 Nissan, after years of *PRO* making lackluster cars and lousy profits, has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits, ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche - like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao, a minicar sold * only in Japan *T*-1.
The company's turnaround is far from complete; many crucial tests are just beginning.
But its surprising progress so far holds important lessons for companies in trouble.
The big one: A company's culture can't be radically changed *-1 unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge.
Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance, helped *PRO*-2 set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery *T*-1.
"This is a time of self - criticism 0 *PRO* to discover what *T*-242 is wrong with us *T*-2," he said *T*-1.
Yutaka Kume, who *T*-243 took the helm as Nissan's president in June 1985, added simply, "I am deeply disappointed."
No wonder.
Nissan, Japan's second - largest auto maker and the world's fourth - largest, was getting beat up *-1 not only by its bigger rival, Toyota Motor Corp., but also by Honda Motor Co., the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan.
Nissan's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.
Its U.S. sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen.
Worst of all, Nissan was preoccupied *-218 with management infighting, cronyism and corporate rigidity.
*PRO* Consider the experience of Satoko Kitada, a 30 - year - old designer of vehicle interiors who *T*-244 joined Nissan in 1982.
At that time, tasks were assigned *-219 strictly on the basis of seniority.
"The oldest designer got *-1 to work on the dashboard," she recalls *T*-2.
"The next level down did doors.
If a new person got *-1 to work on part of the speedometer, that was a big deal."
This system produced boring, boxy cars that consumers just weren't buying *T*-245.
*PRO*-2 Desperately hoping *PRO*-1 to spark sales, Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships.
Meanwhile, President Kume ordered everyone from top executives to rookie designers to go "town watching," to visit chic parts of Tokyo *PRO*-3 to try *PRO*-2 to gain insights into *PRO* developing cars for trend - setters.
Some town - watching excursions were downright comic.
One group of middle - aged manufacturing men from the company's Zama plant outside Tokyo was supposed *-1 to check out a trendy restaurant in the city.
But when they arrived at the door *T*-1, all were afraid *PRO*-2 to go in, *PRO*-2 fearing that they would be out of place.
Other trips were more productive.
Mr. Kume himself visited Honda's headquarters in Tokyo's upscale Aoyama district.
He liked the well - lighted lobby display of Honda's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished.
Later, Nissan borrowed other Honda practices, including an engineering "idea contest" 0 *T*-1 to promote inventiveness.
One engineer developed a "crab car" that *T*-246 moves sideways.
Such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced, but they seem *-1 to be genuine--so much so, in fact, that some older employees have resisted.
Nissan handled the die - hards in a typically Japanese fashion: They weren't fired *-2 but instead "were neglected *-2," says 0 *T*-1 Kouji Hori, the personnel manager at the Nissan Technical Center.
Despite the pain of adjusting, the cultural revolution has begun *-1 to yield exciting cars.
A year ago, the company completely revamped its near - luxury sedan, the $17,699 *U* Maxima, which *T*-247 competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug - nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines.
Since then, Nissan also has launched new versions of the $13,249 *U* 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car.
The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $33,000 *U* and is squared off against the Porche 944, which *T*-248 begins at $41,900 *U*.
Besides new styling, the new Nissans have more powerful engines and more sophisticated suspension systems.
All three new models are outselling their predecessors by wide margins.
In its home market, Nissan has grabbed attention with limited - production minicars featuring styling odd enough *PRO* to be cute.
One is the Pao, a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that *T*-249 give it a droopy - eyed look.
Nissan initially planned *PRO*-1 to sell just 10,000 Paos, but sales have passed 50,000, and there's a one - year waiting list for the car.
Then, there's the S - Cargo, an offbeat delivery van with a snail - like body that *T*-250 inspired its name.
Nissan helped *PRO*-1 develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme.
The chairs are S - Cargo seats, and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled * like the Pao's oversized speedometer.
All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan's morale and image--but haven't done much for its market share.
Nissan had 29% of the Japanese car market in 1980 before *PRO*-1 beginning a depressing eight - year slide that *T*-251 continued through last year.
Strong sales so far this year are certain *-1 to turn the tide, but even the 25% market share that Nissan expects *T*-252 in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade.
Nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market - share losses in Japan until at least 1995, and even that timetable might prove *-1 optimistic.
"Everyone else is going *-2 to catch up" with Nissan's innovative designs, says 0 *T*-1 A. Rama Krishna, auto analyst at First Boston (Japan) Ltd.
Nissan's pace of new - model hits will slow, he adds 0 *?*, just as arch - rival Toyota unleashes its own batch of new cars.
Likewise, in the U.S., Nissan has grabbed 5.2% of the car market so far this year, up from 4.5% a year ago.
But even that brings Nissan only to the share 0 it had *T*-1 in 1987, and leaves the company behind its high of 5.5% in 1980 and 1982.
Why?
So far, Nissan's new - model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential.
In compact and subcompact cars, the bread - and - butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers, Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda.
Nissan hopes that that will start *-1 to change this fall, with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan.
The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda's hugely successful Accord and Toyota's Camry.
But this year, Honda has revamped the Accord and made it a midsized car.
Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza *PRO*-1 a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6%; at $11,450 *U*, Stanza prices start $749 *U* below the predecessor model yet have a more - powerful engine.
Accord prices start at $12,345 *U*.
Nissan's risk is that its low - base - price strategy might get lost *-1 amid the highly publicized rebates being offered * by Detroit's Big Three.
But "on a new car, a rebate doesn't work well" because it cheapens the vehicle's image, contends 0 *T*-1 Thomas D. Mignanelli, executive vice president of Nissan's U.S. sales arm.
Even if the new Stanza succeeds, Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment, where its Sentra doesn't measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla *T*-1.
Nissan will introduce a completely revamped Sentra next fall.
At the opposite end of the market, Nissan launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8--three years after Honda pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota's Lexus went on sale.
Nissan started *-1 advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American showrooms.
The ads featured fences, rocks and pussy - willow buds--almost anything but the cars themselves.
The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising.
On the other hand, Nissan's sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with Toyota's targets for Lexus.
Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $38,000 *U* Infiniti Q45 sedans each month, *PRO*-1 sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan.
Toyota wants *PRO*-1 to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone.
"When I saw the Lexus sales projections *T*-2, I got worried," confesses *T*-1 Takashi Oka, who *T*-253 led the Infiniti development team.
But on reflection, Mr. Oka says 0 *?*, he concluded that Nissan is being prudent in *PRO*-2 following its slow - startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus.
"Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry *PRO* to generate large profits right away," Mr. Oka says *T*-1.
Despite plans *PRO* to add two new Infiniti models next year, *PRO* bringing the total to four, Infiniti won't show profits for at least five years, he adds 0 *T*-1.
These days Nissan can afford that strategy, even though profits aren't exactly robust.
Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million *U*) in the fiscal year ended last March 31, a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier, when the company lost money on operations *T*-1.
Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by *PRO*-1 cutting costs and by *PRO*-1 taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales.
But Nissan expects *PRO*-2 to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year, a modest increase of 4.7%.
The big reason: For all its cost - cutting, Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota.
In its last fiscal year, Nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at Toyota.
*PRO*-1 To help *PRO*-2 close the gap, Nissan recently established a top - level cost - cutting committee.
Nissan is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas--the U.S., Japan and Europe.
That gives it an enviable strategic advantage, at least until its rivals catch up, but also plenty of managerial headaches.
For example, Nissan's U.S. operations include 10 separate subsidiaries--for manufacturing, sales, design, research, etc.--that *T*-254 report separately back to Japan.
And in July, Nissan's Tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a United Auto Workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that *T*-255 have left some workers *PRO*-256 bitter.
"We are in a transitional phase from *PRO* being a Japanese company to *PRO* becoming an international company based * in Japan," says *T*-1 Mr. Muramatsu, the executive vice president.
He promises that Nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all U.S. operations, just as it's doing in Europe.
Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, will be *PRO* to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues.
Already, personnel officials are talking about the need for a "Phase Two" cultural - reform effort of some sort.
"We are still only half way through the turnaround of this company, and there are many more things 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2," President Kume says *T*-1.
He adds, however, that "the momentum 0 we have generated *T*-1 is unstoppable.
Liberty National Bancorp said 0 its acquisition of Florence Deposit Bank, Florence, Ky., first announced * in April, has been completed *-31 in a transaction valued * at $13.1 million *U*.
Liberty National exchanged about 78.64 shares of its common stock for each of Florence Deposit's 5,600 shares outstanding.
Liberty National, a bank holding company, has assets exceeding $3 billion *U*.
Healthcare International Inc. said 0 it reached a 120 - day standstill agreement *ICH*-1 with its HealthVest affiliate calling for Healthcare to pay HealthVest $5 million *U* right away and additional amounts in the future.
Under the agreement, Healthcare, a manager of health - care facilities, said 0 it would pay HealthVest $3.9 million *U* in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $1.1 million *U* in funds that HealthVest advanced *T*-150 for construction work on facilities.
In return, HealthVest agreed that it won't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120 - day period.
After the payment, Healthcare still will be $6.5 million *U* in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest, a real estate investment trust whose portfolio *T*-151 consists largely of properties operated * by Healthcare.
Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12% note for that overdue amount, 0 *T*-1 to be repaid *-2 over three years.
In addition, Healthcare agreed *PRO*-4 to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $2.7 million to $3 million *U* to HealthVest *ICH*-2 during the standstill period, 0 *T*-3 to be paid *-125 when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales *T*-1.
Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $4.2 million *U* in rent and mortgage payments each month, the amount due above the amount paid * will be added *-126 to the three - year note.
The funds should help *PRO*-1 ease a cash bind at HealthVest, which *T*-152 has been unable *PRO*-2 to pay its debts because Healthcare hasn't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July.
A spokesman said 0 HealthVest has paid two of the three banks 0 it owed interest to *T*-1 in October and is in negotiations with the third bank.
Healthcare, which *T*-153 has been in a severe liquidity bind, said 0 it is able *PRO*-3 to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $500,000 *U* and loaned Healthcare $9 million *U* *T*-2.
The loan is backed *-127 by Healthcare's 5.4% stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities.
Researchers at Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Belgium said 0 they have developed a genetic engineering technique for *PRO* creating hybrid plants for a number of key crops.
The researchers said 0 they have isolated a plant gene that *T*-35 prevents the production of pollen.
The gene thus can prevent a plant from *PRO*-1 fertilizing itself.
Such so - called male - sterile plants can then be fertilized *-14 by pollen from another strain of the plant, thereby *PRO* producing hybrid seed.
The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing, high - production trait known * as "hybrid vigor," similar to that now seen * in hybrid corn.
"The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production, especially cotton," said *T*-1 Murray Robinson, president of Delta & Pine Land Co., a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that *T*-36 is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S. .
On a commercial scale, the sterilization of the pollen - producing male part has only been achieved *-15 in corn and sorghum feed grains.
That's because the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant.
In a labor - intensive process, the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant, *PRO*-1 making it male sterile.
They sow a row of male - fertile plants *ICH*-1 nearby, which then *T*-2 pollinate the male - sterile plants.
The first hybrid corn seeds produced * *PRO* using this mechanical approach were introduced *-16 in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20% more corn than naturally pollinated plants.
The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown *-17 from hybrid seeds produced * by seed companies.
A similar technique is almost impossible 0 *PRO* to apply *T*-1 to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.
The male part *RNR*-2, the anthers of the plant, and the female *RNR*-2, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached *-1 to each other.
The anthers in these plants are difficult 0 *PRO* to clip *T*-1 off.
In China, a great number of workers are engaged *-18 in *PRO*-2 pulling out the male organs of rice plants *PRO*-3 using tweezers, and one - third of rice produced * in that country is grown *-19 from hybrid seeds.
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen - inhibiting gene that *T*-1 can be inserted *-20 in a plant *PRO* to confer male sterility.
Jan Leemans, research director, said 0 this gene was successfully introduced *-1 in oil - producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in Europe and Canada, *PRO* using as a carrier a "promoter gene" developed * by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles.
The sterilizing gene is expressed *-21 just before the pollen is about *-1 to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.
Mr. Leemans said 0 this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant.
The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order *PRO*-1 to get male - sterile plants in large enough numbers *PRO* to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop.
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen - inhibiting gene.
Both genes are then inserted *-2 into a few greenhouse plants, which *T*-37 are then pollinated *-1 and allowed *PRO*-1 to mature and produce seed.
The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse - produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.
The application of herbicide would kill off the male - fertile plants, *PRO*-1 leaving a large field of male - sterile plants that *T*-2 can be cross-pollinated *-22 *PRO* to produce hybrid seed.
Mr. Leemans said 0 the hybrid rapeseeds created * with this genetic engineering yield 15% to 30% *U* more output than the commercial strains used * currently.
"This technique is applicable to a wide variety of crops," he said *T*-1, and added that some modifications may be necessary *PRO* to accommodate the peculiarities of each type of crop.
He said 0 the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa, and plans *PRO*-2 to include cotton and corn, among other crops.
He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted * are hybrids, the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers, which *T*-38 costs U.S. seed producers about $70 million *U* annually.
In recent years, demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies, including Monsanto Co., Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.
One technique developed * by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed *PRO* to kill only a plant's pollen.
But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects.
However, Paul Johanson, Monsanto's director of plant sciences, said 0 the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ."
Biosource Genetics Corp., Vacaville, Calif., is developing a spray containing a gene that *T*-39 spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that *T*-40 are responsible for *PRO* producing pollen.
This gene, called *PRO* "*PRO*-42 gametocide," is carried *-23 into the plant by a virus that *T*-41 remains active for a few days.
Robert Erwin, president of Biosource, called Plant Genetic's approach *PRO*-1 "interesting" and "novel," and "complementary rather than competitive."
"There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds," he said *T*-1.
Mr. Robinson of Delta & Pine, the seed producer in Scott, Miss., said 0 Plant Genetic's success in *PRO* creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean 0 it *EXP*-1 would be simple *PRO* to create hybrids in all crops.
That's because pollination, while *PRO* easy in corn because the carrier is wind, is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton.
"It *EXP*-2's one thing *PRO* to say 0 you can sterilize, and another *PRO* to then successfully pollinate the plant," he said *T*-1.
Nevertheless, he said 0 *?*, he is negotiating with Plant Genetic *PRO*-2 to acquire the technology 0 *T*-3 to try *PRO*-4 breeding hybrid cotton.
Alltel Corp. said 0 it will acquire the 55% of Pond Branch Telephone Company Inc.'s cellular franchise that it doesn't own *T*-1 already.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Alltel holds 45% of the franchise, which *T*-59 has operations in Aiken, S.C., and Augusta, Ga.
Alltel, which *T*-60 provides local telephone service in 25 states, said 0 it exercised its right of first refusal following an offer *ICH*-1 from an undisclosed third party *PRO* to acquire the majority position in the franchise.
As a money manager and a grass - roots environmentalist, I was very disappointed *PRO*-1 to read in the premiere issue of Garbage that The Wall Street Journal uses 220,000 metric tons of newsprint each year, but that only 1.4% of it comes from recycled paper.
By contrast, the Los Angeles Times, for example, uses 83% recycled paper.
With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills, and with our country overflowing with trash, all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources.
The Wall Street Journal is an excellent publication that I enjoy *PRO*-2 reading *T*-1 (and must read *T*-1) daily.
*PRO* Please make me and thousands of other readers more comfortable with our daily purchase of your newspaper by *PRO*-1 raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels, and increase your use of recycled paper.

` Frequent Drinker' Offer Stirs Up Spirited Debate
*PRO*-1 TO GRAB a bigger piece of the declining scotch market, Seagram Co. has launched a controversial "frequent drinker" promotion for its Chivas Regal brand.
Under the program, dubbed *PRO* *PRO*-215 Chivas Class, customers who *T*-214 send in two labels from Chivas bottles will receive an upgrade in seating class on some Trans World Airlines flights.
Repeat customers also can purchase luxury items at reduced prices.
But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse, some liquor marketers consider Seagram's frequent buyer promotion risky.
"I'm surprised 0 they're doing this," says *T*-1 Penn Kavanagh, president of Schieffelin & Somerset Co., which *T*-215 markets Johnnie Walker scotches.
"I would be very leery of anything that *T*-216 says if you drink more, you get more."
Others question the impact on Chivas's upscale image of a promotion that *T*-217 has customers soaking off labels.
"It's really bizarre," says *T*-1 Albert Lerman, creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency.
"Chivas has an image of something 0 you would savor, rather than guzzle *T*-1."
Chivas Class isn't the first such promotion.
Last year, J&B Scotch offered 500 TWA frequent flier miles in exchange for a label.
And Dewar's gave discounts on Scottish merchandise to people who *T*-218 sent in bottle labels.
But the scope of Seagram's Chivas promotion sets it apart.
The current campaign is just the first leg of an aggressive three - to - five - year direct marketing plan.
Seagram says 0 the promotion is designed *PRO*-1 to build brand loyalty rather than promote heavy drinking.
Seagram asks customers *PRO*-2 to buy only two or three bottles over a 12 - month period, says 0 *T*-1 Richard Shaw, vice president of U.S. direct marketing.
"We're not asking them *PRO*-1 to save up 50 proof - of - purchases.
We're not saying *PRO* drink more, we're saying *PRO* trade up."
Goya Concocts a Milk For Hispanic Tastes
MOST FOOD companies these days are trimming the fat and cholesterol content of their products *PRO*-1 to appeal to health - conscious consumers.
But Goya Foods Inc. believes 0 it can milk some sales by *PRO*-1 bucking the trend.
The Secaucus, N.J., company has formed a joint venture with a distributor called *PRO* *PRO*-2 La Lecheria *PRO*-1 to market a higher - fat milk targeted * at Hispanic consumers.
*PRO* To give Leche Fresca the creamier taste 0 Goya says 0 Hispanics prefer *T*-1, the new brand has a butterfat content of 3.8%.
That compares with 3.5% butterfat for whole milk.
A spokesman for Borden Inc., the nation's largest milk producer, concedes 0 Goya may be on to something.
Borden sells considerably more whole milk than reduced - fat milks in southern and Hispanic markets, he says 0 *T*-1.
Borden even tested a milk with 4% butterfat in the South, but decided 0 the market was too small.
Goya is selling Leche Fresca in nearly 500 grocery stores and bodegas in New York and parts of New Jersey.
And it's adding 15 to 20 new outlets a day, says 0 *T*-1 Greg Ricca, sales director at La Lecheria.
Because of Leche Fresca's success, he says 0 *?*, the joint venture is developing other dairy products tailored * to Hispanic tastes.
Jewelry Makers Copy Cosmetics Sales Ploys
FOR YEARS, costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle.
Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired.
And the merchandise was, well, fake.
As a result, marketers of faux gems steadily lost space in department stores to more fashionable rivals--cosmetics makers.
But lately, retailers say 0 *?*, fake has become more fashionable.
And jewelry makers are beginning *-1 to use many of the same marketing tricks honed * in the aggressive world of cosmetics.
Last year, the total women's fashion jewelry business topped $4.9 billion *U*, says 0 *T*-1 Karen Alberg, editor of Accessories magazine.
And it's growing fast, with annual sales gains of more than 10%.
*PRO*-1 To increase their share of that business, jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc.'s Trifari and Monet units and Swank Inc., maker of Anne Klein jewelry, are launching new lines with as much fanfare as the fragrance companies.
They're hiring models 0 *T*-1 to stroll the aisles *PRO*-2 sporting their jewels, and they're even beginning *-4 to borrow a perennial favorite of the beauty business--*PRO* offering a gift when consumers make a purchase *T*-3.
"We've started *-2 trying just about anything *PRO*-3 to keep sales moving in the stores," says *T*-1 Kim Renk, a Swank vice president.
But there are limits.
Ms. Renk says 0 retailers nixed a promotion for pins with animal motifs.
Her idea: *PRO* bring in live zoo animals.
Trifari, whose national ads *T*-219 earlier this year included paper cutouts of its costume finery, takes a tamer approach.
The company focuses on the how - to aspects, says 0 *T*-1 Andrew E. Philip, president.
Trifari now trains sales help to advise customers on the best earring styles.
But cosmetics firms still have one big marketing edge: They motivate sales people with commissions.
Jewelry makers rarely pay commissions and aren't expected *-1 to *?* anytime soon.
Odds and Ends
DESPITE GROWING interest in the environment, U.S. consumers haven't shown much interest in refillable packages for household products.
Procter & Gamble Co. recently introduced refillable versions of four products, including Tide and Mr. Clean, in Canada, but doesn't plan *PRO*-1 to bring them to the U.S. .
Marketers believe 0 most Americans won't make the convenience trade - off....

Japan has found another safe outlet for its money: U.S. home mortgages.
An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that *T*-175 have been pooled *-2 and packaged *-2 for sale as interest - bearing instruments known * as mortgage - backed securities.
As much as 10% *U* of new U.S. mortgage securities issued * by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, now flow into Japanese hands.
That may not come as a surprise to Americans who *T*-176 have watched the Japanese snap up properties in the U.S. from golf courses to a stake in Rockefeller Center.
But it marks a big change for the Japanese, who *T*-177 shunned mortgage securities after *PRO*-1 getting burned *-2 by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back.
"You can't say 0 it's a "tsunami" (tidal wave), but we're making some headway," says *T*-1 Fannie Mae's chairman, David O. Maxwell, who *T*-178 visits Tokyo at least once a year *PRO*-3 to explain *RNR*-4 and drum up investor interest in *RNR*-4 mortgage securities.
"Interest is a great deal higher than it was *?* a year ago."
The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of *PRO* building up a similar market here.
Evidence of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds.
Earlier this year, Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank, had no trouble *PRO* selling out a special $570 million *U* mortgage - securities trust 0 it created *T*-1 for Japanese investors.
Industrial Bank of Japan, which *T*-179 claims *PRO*-2 to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities, says 0 it will more than double its purchases this year, to an amount 0 one official puts *T*-1 at several billion dollars.
And a Fannie Mae seminar this week promises *PRO*-2 to draw hundreds of prospective investors, who *T*-180 can be expected *-1 to channel tens of billions of dollars into the market in the next few years.
"Last year, there were only several big investors who *T*-181 were interested," says *T*-1 Kinji Kato, a vice president at the international arm of Nomura Securities Co.
"This year, some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot."
Ultimately, he says 0 *?*, strong demand could help *PRO*-2 to drive down interest rates on mortgage securities.
At the moment, Nomura is the only Japanese institution authorized *PRO* to act as a primary seller of Fannie Mae instruments.
But other Japanese institutions say privately that they are considering *PRO*-1 asking *PRO*-2 to join the 59 - dealer selling group.
These securities are attractive to Japanese investors for three reasons.
First, they are safe.
While they aren't backed *-1 by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are *?*, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary.
(U.S. Treasury bonds are still the dollar - denominated investment of choice for long - term Japanese investors).
Second, they are liquid.
The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $900 billion *U*, or nearly half of the $2.2 trillion *U* in U.S. residential mortgages issued *.
Third, they offer high yields.
At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities.
But there is a risk, which the Japanese discovered *T*-182 when they first dipped their toes into the market nearly five years ago *T*-1.
Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced *-1 at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right *PRO* to buy back their bonds before maturity.
That's a headache for long - term investors, since it forces them *PRO*-1 to reinvest their money--usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried *?*.
"Two or three years ago, the problem was that people didn't understand the prepayment risk," says *T*-1 Nomura's Mr. Kato.
"So they were surprised and very disappointed by prepayment."
*PRO* Compounding the trouble to Japanese investors, mortgage securities pay interest monthly, since most mortgages require homeowners *PRO*-1 to make monthly payments.
But Japanese institutional investors are used *-167 to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments, so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems.
As a result, Japanese investors steered clear of the mortgage securities.
But they didn't lose touch with the U.S. issuers.
Since 1985, Japanese investors have bought nearly 80% of $10 billion *U* in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued * to foreigners, money that Fannie Mae uses *T*-183 *PRO*-1 to buy mortgages from U.S. banks.
And Japanese investors took up nearly all of two $200 million *U* Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits, a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation, that *T*-1 were offered *-168 to foreigners this year.
In addition, further packaging of mortgage - backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have *-1 to *?*.
Freddie Mac for years has offered a so - called participation certificate that *T*-184 guarantees 0 it won't be prepaid *-169 for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments.
Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general - purpose computer that *T*-136 will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp.
The closely held Sunnyvale, Calif., company also will announce an agreement *PRO* to supply computers to Control Data Corp., which *T*-137 will sell Mips machines under its own label.
The new Mips machine, called *PRO* *PRO*-1 the RC6280, will cost $150,000 *U* for a basic system.
The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip, unlike many rival machines using several processors.
The machine employs reduced instruction - set computing, or RISC, technology.
At that price, an analyst familiar with the machine said 0 *?*, the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines.
"In the price range it's a tremendously high - performing product," said *T*-1 Sandy Gant, an analyst at the market - research firm InfoCorp.
The machine is part of an effort *ICH*-1 by Mips *PRO* to establish itself as a supplier of computers, not just of integrated - circuit technology.
Mips also wants *PRO*-1 to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering; Mips said 0 the new machine will also be used *-102 by businesses and for communications.
"This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company," said *T*-1 Mips Vice President John Hime.
The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five - year - old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun, Hewlett - Packard Co., Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines.
RISC technology speeds up a computer by *PRO*-1 simplifying the internal software.
For Mips, which *T*-138 expects revenue of $100 million *U* this year, big - name allies such as Control Data are essential *PRO* to attract software developers to the company's RISC architecture.
"The thing 0 it says *T*-1 about Mips is that they're on a roll right now," said *T*-2 Ms. Gant at InfoCorp.
"They're getting some major wins," she added *T*-1.
Last month, for example, Mips agreed *PRO*-1 to supply its computers to Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany and France's Groupe Bull.
Sony Corp., Tandem Computers Inc. and Digital Equipment have agreed *PRO*-1 to sell MIPS computers and companies such as Japan's NEC Corp. and West Germany's Siemens A.G. have agreed *PRO*-2 to make Mips chips under license.
Today's agreement gives Control Data a machine 0 *T*-1 to compete against Digital and other general - purpose computer makers, said 0 *T*-2 John Logan, a computer - market analyst at Aberdeen Group Inc. of Boston.
The machine is essentially a mainframe computer, he said 0 *T*-1.
"Suddenly CDC (Control Data) has a competitive product 0 *T*-2 to fight back against the VAX9000," a machine 0 Digital announced last month *T*-3, he added 0 *T*-1.
Control Data, based * in Minneapolis, Minn., expects its sales of Mips systems, including the new RC6280, to amount to more than $100 million *U* by the end of 1991, Mips said 0 *T*-2.
Nixdorf, Bull and others will also sell versions of the machine, said 0 *T*-1 Mips President Robert Miller.
Mips will start *-2 shipping its new machine in the first quarter of 1990, he said *T*-1.
The machine uses a single processor, which *T*-139 makes it easier 0 *PRO* to program *T*-1 than competing machines using several processors.
The computer can process 13.3 million calculations called *PRO* *PRO*-1 floating - point operations every second.
The machine can run software written * for other Mips computers, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Thomas A. Donovan, 37 years old, formerly vice president, West Coast operations, at this hazardous - waste - site remediation concern, was named *-1 *-2 *PRO*-4 executive vice president and chief operating officer, both newly created posts, and a director, *PRO* filling a vacancy.
Canonie said 0 it anticipates *PRO*-1 naming Mr. Donovan *PRO*-2 to succeed Richard F. Brissette, 55, as president and chief executive officer, effective March 1.
Mr. Brissette will remain a Canonie board member and will be a consultant to the company.
Newport Electronics Inc. named a new slate of officers, a move that *T*-146 follows replacement of the company's five incumbent directors last week.
Milton B. Hollander, 60 years old, was named *-117 *PRO*-118 chief executive officer, *PRO*-117 succeeding Barrett B. Weekes.
Mr. Hollander's Stamford, Conn. - based High Technology Holding Co. acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
Mr. Hollander was named *-118 *PRO*-148 chairman last week, *PRO*-118 succeeding Mr. Weekes, who *T*-147 was among the ousted directors.
The company has declined requests *PRO* to discuss the changes, but Mr. Weekes has said that Mr. Hollander wanted *PRO*-1 to have his own team.
Scott Wakeman was named *-119 *PRO*-121 president and chief operating officer of U.S. operations, titles that *T*-1 had been held *-120 by Mr. Weekes.
Mr. Wakeman was vice president of the instrument and controls division of closely held Omega Engineering Inc., another company controlled * by Mr. Hollander.
A company spokesman didn't know Mr. Wakeman's age.
James R. Lees, 51, vice president of Newport's European operations, was named *-121 *PRO*-122 executive vice president and chief operating officer of European operations, *PRO*-121 assuming some former duties of Mr. Weekes.
Arthur B. Crozier, 34, an attorney, was named *-122 *PRO*-149 secretary, *PRO*-122 succeeding John Virtue, who *T*-148 was another of the ousted directors.
An arbitrator awarded Eastern Airlines pilots between $60 million and $100 million *U* in back pay, a decision that *T*-285 could complicate the carrier's bankruptcy - law reorganization.
Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said 0 it is examining the ruling *PRO*-1 to determine if it can appeal.
It *EXP*-1's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in *PRO*-2 overturning the arbitrator's decision, made * in a long - simmering "pay parity" dispute that *T*-286 predates both the carrier's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air.
All Eastern's previous court efforts *PRO* to head off the pilots' demands have failed.
An Eastern spokesman said 0 he doesn't expect that the arbitrator's ruling "will have any overall material effect on the company's strategic plan."
Bankruptcy experts said 0 the law isn't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company's case *T*-1.
Like any other creditor, the pilots will have *-1 to apply to the court for payment of their claim.
That may leave a lot of leeway 0 for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect *T*-287 *T*-1.
In August, he issued the ruling that *T*-288 let the pilots pursue their back - pay grievance before the arbitrator.
The pilots' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances.
In a statement to employees, Eastern said 0 the company was disappointed by the ruling.
"The obligation is totally unwarranted," the statement said *T*-1.
James Linsey, a lawyer for the Air Line Pilots Association, said 0 the pilots were extremely pleased.
"This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee," he said *T*-1.
Eastern's creditors committee, along with the company, has consistently opposed the pilots' claim, which if *PRO*-2 paid *-5 *T*-1 would have *-2 to come out of money 0 both hope *PRO*-6 to use *T*-3 *PRO*-4 to pay off other bankruptcy claims.
Eastern and its creditors are in the final, delicate stages of *PRO* negotiating a second reorganization plan *PRO* to pay off the airline's debts.
An earlier plan, which *T*-289 had received the creditors' approval in July, fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan *T*-1.
It isn't known whether the pilot claim was figured *-245 into either plan.
The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a "pay parity" clause in the pilots' contract.
The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise *T*-1.
Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern, some Machinists union supervisors received a 20% pay raise.
The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them.
Eastern has disputed the claim, but a federal district court, an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots.
The two sides don't even agree about how much money *T*-1 is at issue.
The pilots put the amount as high as $100 million *U*, the company at $65 million *U*.
Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots, resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted * another union.
A decision on that case isn't expected *-1 before mid-November.
Ironically, many of the pilots involved * have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier, which *T*-290 filed for bankruptcy protection March 9.
About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work.
Another fight is brewing between Congress and the Bush administration over how *PRO* to pay for the savings - and - loan bailout without *PRO*-2 adding to the federal budget deficit *T*-1.
In a hearing before the House Ways and Means Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office, which *T*-1 both are arms of Congress, advised the new S&L bailout agency *PRO*-3 to abandon plans *PRO* to raise temporary working capital through debt issued * from an agency that *T*-2 wouldn't be counted *-103 on the federal budget.
Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative *PRO* to raise short - term cash for the bailout.
Instead, the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office said 0 *?*, the RTC should consider *PRO*-2 using Treasury debt, which *T*-140 is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress.
The spending could be exempted *-1 from *PRO*-2 meeting deficit - reduction targets in the Gramm - Rudman budget law.
The RTC has projected that it will require between $50 billion to $100 billion *U* in temporary working capital.
The borrowing 0 *T*-1 to raise these funds would be paid *-104 off as assets of sick thrifts are sold *-105.
The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85% of the value of the assets 0 it holds *T*-1.
But higher interest rates paid * on off - budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs, and wouldn't be subject to congressional scrutiny, Ways and Means members argued 0 *T*-2.
"*PRO* To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible," said *T*-2 Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.), who *T*-141 has introduced a bill 0 *T*-1 to limit the RTC's authority *PRO* to issue debt.
The RTC will have *-1 to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years.
The new S&L bailout law allows $50 billion *U* to be spent *-1 *PRO* to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets, but that is a net cost.
In the meantime, the agency must raise cash *PRO*-1 to maintain assets, such as real estate, until they can be sold *-106.
Then the short - term debt is paid *-107 off through the proceeds of *PRO* selling the assets.
David Mullins, assistant secretary of the Treasury, said that the working capital is necessary *PRO* to reduce the final costs of the bailout, by *PRO*-1 allowing the agency to sell savings and loans without their bad assets, then hold the assets until they can be sold *-108 under favorable conditions.
He said 0 it *ICH*-3 hasn't yet been determined *-109 how the RTC will raise the cash *T*-1, but the administration doesn't want it to be included *-2 on the federal budget, because it would "distort" the budget process by *PRO*-4 requiring either exemptions from Gramm - Rudman or big increases in the budget deficit.
But the worst possibility would be *PRO* raising no working capital, he said 0 *T*-1.
"If working capital financing is not provided *-3," he said *?*, "the RTC may have *-2 to slow {S&L sales} or dump acquired assets through fire sales.
Giovanni Agnelli & Co. announced a transaction that *T*-114 will strengthen its indirect control of Fiat S.p . A. and will admit Prince Karim Aga Khan as its first non-family shareholder.
Giovanni Agnelli, a limited partnership that *T*-115 is the master holding company for Fiat's Agnelli family, owns approximately 75% of the shares in Istituto Finanziario Industriale, which *T*-1 in turn owns approximately 40% of Fiat, Italy's biggest private - sector industrial group.
The company said 0 Maria Sole Agnelli Teodorani, sister of Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, agreed *PRO*-1 to trade her shares in IFI for new ordinary shares in the limited partnership, which *T*-116 will give her control of 4.67% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co.
The Aga Khan, meanwhile, agreed *PRO*-1 to trade some of his stake in Luxembourg - based Ifint S.A., another Agnelli family company, for 7.45% of Giovanni Agnelli & Co.'s capital.
His new stake would be in the form of preferred shares, which *T*-117 receive higher dividends but have voting rights only in extraordinary shareholders assemblies.
The Aga Khan owns 10% of Ifint's capital, while IFI owns 23%.
As a result of the transaction, which *T*-118 is expected *-1 to be approved *-83 at a shareholders meeting Nov. 24, Giovanni Agnelli & Co. will control 79.18% of IFI's ordinary shares.
Its capital will also be raised *-84 to 232.4 billion lire ($172.5 million *U*) from the current 204.3 billion lire.
IFI also has nonvoting preferred shares, which *T*-1 are quoted *-85 on the Milan stock exchange.
The value of the two transactions wasn't disclosed *-1, but an IFI spokesman said 0 no cash would change hands.
The move strengthens the existing links between the Agnellis and the Aga Khan, the head of the world's Ismaili Moslems who *T*-119 is a longtime family friend and *PRO*-1 frequently goes sailing with Mr. Agnelli.
Mr. Agnelli and the Aga Khan also have some business ties, and a spokesman for the Agnelli company didn't rule out that the current agreement could lead to further collaboration.
For instance, Ifint earlier this year bought an 18% stake in Alisarda, the Aga Khan's airline, which *T*-120 flies between Italy and Sardinia.
Giovanni Agnelli & Co., which *T*-1 was formed *-86 in January 1987 as a way of *PRO* keeping the Agnellis' controlling stake in Fiat *PRO*-87 together despite an ever - growing family tree, has been playing a more active role in the Agnelli group of late.
It raised financing of 300 billion lire for the purchase this summer by another Agnelli - related group of the food concern Galbani S.p . A., by *PRO*-1 selling a chunk of its IFI shares to Mediobanca S.p . A.
Mediobanca said during the weekend that it agreed *PRO*-2 to sell the shares back to Giovanni Agnelli for 333 billion lire.
Congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed on a compromise minimum - wage bill, *PRO*-1 opening the way for the first wage - floor boost in more than nine years.
The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue.
President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed * by Congress and said 0 he wouldn't accept any minimum - wage rise that *T*-121 went beyond limits 0 he set *T*-2 early in this year's debate on the issue.
The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said 0 it would accept *T*-1.
Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders, the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 *U* an hour to $4.25 *U* an hour by April 1991.
Employers could also pay a subminimum "training wage" for 90 days to new workers who *T*-122 are up to 19 years old *NOT*, and then for another 90 days if the company institutes a specific training program for the newcomers.
White House officials were delighted that the compromise includes the concept of a training wage, which Mr. Bush has fought for *T*-1 throughout the year.
"For the first time in history, we have a training wage that *T*-123 will be part" of the nation's labor laws, said 0 *T*-1 Roger Porter, assistant to the president for economic and domestic policy.
White House aides said that although they made a small compromise on the length of a training wage, the final minimum - wage increase will meet the standards set * by Mr. Bush.
The bill vetoed * by the president in June, which the House failed *-1 to override *T*-2, would have lifted the minimum wage to $4.55 *U* an hour by late 1991, with a training wage for up to two months, generally for a worker's first job.
Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $4.25 *U* an hour by the end of 1991, coupled * with a six - month training wage for workers newly hired * by any employer.
Under the compromise, the $4.25 *U* level would be reached *-87 nine months earlier, while the training subminimum would be shorter, unless it is tied *-88 to a training plan.
Democrats argued that the training wage was a way of *PRO* allowing employers to pay less than the minimum wage, while new workers need far less than six months *PRO*-1 to be trained *-89 for their jobs.
Democrats had been negotiating with some Republican congressional leaders on a compromise lately.
With congressional elections next year, GOP leaders have worried about *PRO*-1 opposing a minimum - wage rise for low - paid workers at a time when Congress is moving toward a capital - gains tax cut that *T*-124 would directly benefit wealthier taxpayers *T*-2.
Republicans have been imploring the White House *PRO*-1 to compromise on the wage issue.
In the Senate, Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Labor Committee, and Pete Domenici, (R., N.M .) ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, have been working on a compromise, and their soundings showed that the Senate appeared *-2 to be heading toward enough strength *PRO* to override another Bush veto, a Democratic staff official said 0 *T*-1.
The House is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to vote this week on the compromise, as a substitute to a new Democratic bill, itself watered * down from last spring's version.
The Senate will probably vote not long afterward.
Some Democrats thought 0 they might have compromised too much.
Rep. Austin Murphy (D., Pa.), chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee, said 0 they might have done better "if we'd held their feet to the fire."
Mr. Kennedy suggested 0 Democrats "yielded a great deal" on the size of the increase, but he cited concessions from the White House on the training wage, which he said 0 *?* *T*-1 make it "less harsh."
With only 16 - year - olds to 19 - year - olds eligible, 68% of workers getting less than $4.25 *U* an hour, who *T*-125 are adults, won't be subject to the training wage, he said 0 *T*-1.
The AFL - CIO, which *T*-126 previously opposed the administration's subminimum idea, said 0 the compromise has "adequate safeguards, so the youth are not exploited *-1 and older workers are not displaced *-2."

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's leader and one of Asia's leading statesmen for 30 years, recently announced his intention *PRO* to retire next year--though *PRO* not necessarily to end his influence.
The prime minister, whose hair *T*-298 is thinning and gray and whose face *T*-299 has a perpetual pallor, nonetheless continues *-1 to display an energy, a precision of thought and a willingness *PRO* to say publicly what most other Asian leaders dare *PRO*-2 say *T*-300 only privately.
The 66 - year - old Mr. Lee recently spent an hour *PRO*-1 discussing the state of Asia and the world with two Journal reporters in his plainly furnished, wood - paneled office.
The interview did not touch on Singapore's domestic affairs.
*PRO*-3 Skipping personal pleasantries, Mr. Lee picked up exactly where he left off *T*-2 several months earlier--before the government crackdown in China--when he had warned that the orthodox leadership in Beijing feared a plurality of views *T*-1.
Excerpts follow:
On China's turmoil: "It is a very unhappy scene," he said *T*-1.
"It took Zhao Ziyang (former premier and party chief) 10 years *PRO*-2 to build a team of economists who *T*-301 understood how the Western economies work *T*-1 and now that team is part in exile, part being rusticated * and part missing."
*PRO* Rebuilding that team, Mr. Lee predicted 0 *?*, will take another 10 years.
"That's very sad for China and for Asia because China could have been a good engine for growth, not just for Hong Kong and Taiwan but for Japan, Korea and the rest of Asia."
On similarities between China and the Soviet Union: "In important particulars, the Soviets are different from the Chinese.
They are already industrialized....
Their problem is one of inefficiency of an industrial economy.
The Chinese problem is much greater--it's how *PRO* to industrialize *T*-1 *PRO* to begin with."
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 if the Soviets, like Chinese officials, won't one day face a similar conflict between the desire *PRO* to liberalize economically and yet retain political control, Mr. Lee said, "I would think that the Soviets face a deeper dilemma because they have been more in blinkers than the Chinese--I mean *PRO* keeping their people cut off from the outside world."
Mikhail Gorbachev, he said 0 *?*, is ahead of China's leaders in his awareness of the world.
"But I think 0 the Soviet peoples are more introverted than the Chinese."
Regardless, he said *?*, he still believes 0 the Soviet Union, while *PRO*-2 falling far short of the efficiency of a Western economy, may well manage *PRO*-2 to improve considerably.
On Asia - Pacific prosperity: "If America can keep up the present situation--her markets open for another 15 years, with adjustments, and Japan can grow and not cut back, and so too, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand--then in 15 years, the economies of these countries would be totally restructured *PRO*-2 to be able *PRO*-3 to almost sustain growth by themselves."
In such an arrangement, "all benefit," he said 0 *T*-1.
"And if the Europeans come in, they benefit too.
It's not a zero - sum game."
*PRO*-2 Asked *-3 about the possibility of greater economic cooperation among Asia - Pacific nations, which *T*-1 will be discussed *-247 Nov. 6 and 7 at a ministerial meeting in Canberra, Mr. Lee said 0 the goal "is *PRO* to have a free and open world trading system."
An Asian bloc isn't intended, he said 0 *T*-1.
"That's not possible."
On U.S. - Japan relations: "I'm encouraged.
I think 0 the earlier strident notes struck * by {U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert} Mosbacher and {U.S. Trade Representative} Carla Hills have been more rounded.
I believe 0 the U.S. is becoming more patient and circumspect," he said *T*-1.
"It's the total relationship that *T*-2 is important."
The total relationship, as Mr. Lee sees it, is "the flow of dollars to the U.S. 0 *T*-2 to fund the deficits, the investments 0 the Japanese are making *T*-1 in the U.S. in order *PRO*-3 to satisfy American demand that American products consumed * in America should be made *-248 as much as possible in America by Americans with Japanese technology and capital."
Japan's recent political turbulence, Mr. Lee said 0 *?*, may mean 0 Japan will slow market adjustments.
"They'll be more timorous in *PRO*-1 tackling their own voters, like *PRO* opening up more to agricultural imports from America, *PRO* hurting their farmers."
On U.S. military presence in Asia: *PRO*-3 Asked *-4 if his offer *PRO* to allow the American military to use facilities in Singapore would help preserve America's presence in the region at bases in the Philippines, he said, "What we have done *T*-302 is *PRO* make it *EXP*-1 easier for the Philippines to continue *-5 to host American bases without it being said 0 they are lackeys of the imperialists and the only ones in Asia or in Southeast Asia.
We are willing *PRO*-1 to share the political burden of *PRO* being host to America, an imperial power.
We think 0 it isn't such a great burden, that it carries no stigma, and we are prepared *PRO*-1 to do it."
On U.S. - Philippine relations: "It's such a mixed - up relationship going back into history....
I really do not understand how it is that Filipinos feel so passionately involved in this father figure that they want *PRO*-4 to dispose of *T*-1 and yet they need *T*-1 *T*-2.
I just don't understand it.
My relationships with the British are totally different.
They lorded it over me.
They did me some good.
They did themselves even more good.
They let me down when the Japanese came down {during World War II} *T*-1....
I don't feel down or done in because I show British serials on my television network or read their books.
I mean 0 it is a normal adult relationship.
"But the Filipinos and the Americans, when I talk to them *T*-1, there's so much passion about Filipino manhood being diminished * as a result of *PRO* being squatted upon *-2 by the Americans and so on.
The occasional Englishman tries *PRO*-1 to put on airs but we let it pass....
It's just comic when they try *PRO*-2 to pretend 0 they're still the master race *T*-1."
Mr. Lee added that the Filipinos are "making it *EXP*-3 very difficult" for the U.S. military presence to last beyond five or 10 years.
On military alternatives if the U.S. pulls back: "The Soviets already are present.
I suppose 0 sooner or later, the Japanese would have *-1 to fill up a large part of the gap on the naval side.
Maybe the Chinese, maybe even the Indians."
On economic consequences of a diminished U.S. presence: "America is the only major power in recent history that *T*-303 has used its military might *PRO*-1 to sustain a system that *T*-304 enables all participants *PRO*-305 to equally benefit without her as the provider of the security taking royalties."
*PRO*-3 Asked *-4 why so few nations seem *-2 to share his views of America *T*-1, he said, "Many people see it that way.
But they have just taken it for *PRO*-1 granted *-2."
On Cambodia: "*PRO* Let's assume that {former Cambodian leader Prince Norodom} Sihanouk does what the press wants him to do *T*-1 and joins up with {Vietnamese - backed Cambodian leader} Hun Sen.
Is the trouble over?
Can Sihanouk and Hun Sen knock off the Khmer Rouge still supported * by China?
He can't *?*.
"What *T*-305 is the way forward?
*PRO* To get the Khmer Rouge as part of a process for elections.
And when they lose *T*-1, then we can expect China to stop aid.
*PRO* Let's put it bluntly.
The Chinese cannot be seen *-1 to have made use of the Khmer Rouge and then discard them."

The nation's largest pension fund, which *T*-10 oversees $80 billion *U* for college employees, plans *PRO*-1 to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants.
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equities Fund said 0 it will introduce a stock and bond fund that *T*-11 will invest in "socially responsible" companies, and a bond fund.
Both funds are expected *-1 to begin operation around March 1, subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval.
For its employees to sign up for the options, a college also must approve the plan.
Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund.
The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund, *PRO*-1 under pressure *PRO* to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options, reached *T*-12 with the SEC in December.
The new "social choice" fund will shun securities of companies linked *-1 to South Africa, nuclear power and in some cases, Northern Ireland.
Also excluded *-1 will be *T*-2 investments in companies with "significant" business stemming from weapons manufacture, alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
Sixty percent of the fund will be invested *-5 in stocks, with the rest going into bonds or short - term investments.
The bond fund will invest in high - grade or medium - grade bonds, mortgages or asset - backed securities, including as much as 15% in foreign securities.
The fund also might buy and sell futures and options contracts, subject to approval by the New York State Insurance Department.
Under two new features, participants will be able *PRO*-1 to transfer money from the new funds to other investment funds or, if their jobs are terminated *-6, receive cash from the funds.
The investment choices offered * by the pension fund currently are limited *-7 to a stock fund, an annuity and a money - market fund.
Your Oct. 2 page - one article on people riding so - called "railbikes" on railroad tracks was a disservice to your readers.
It unfortunately encourages others *PRO*-2 to engage in a highly dangerous and illegal activity that only a very few are doing *T*-1 now.
And it treats such activities in a frivolous, cavalier fashion, with total indifference to common sense and public safety.

Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., and Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, said 0 they completed the formation of Dow Elanco, a joint venture combining their plant - sciences businesses as well as Dow's industrial pest - control business.
The companies said 0 Dow Elanco will be the largest research - based agricultural concern in North America, with projected first - year revenue of $1.5 billion *U*.
Dow will own 60% of the venture, with Eli Lilly holding the rest.
The venture will be based *-45 in Indianapolis.
J.C. PENNEY Co., Dallas, said 0 it issued $350 million *U* of securities backed * by credit - card receivables.
The offering was priced *-258 with an 8.95% coupon rate at 99.1875% *PRO*-1 to yield 9.19%.
The retailer said 0 the securities are expected *-1 to be rated *-2 *PRO*-5 triple - A by Standard & Poor's Corp. and Aaa by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
They pay interest only for 115 months, with principal payments beginning thereafter.
The expected average life of the certificates is 10 years, with the final scheduled payment in October, 2001.
First Boston Corp. is sole underwriter.
As part of the transaction, J.C. Penney will sell a portion of its credit - card receivables to its JCP Receivables Inc. unit, which *T*-315 will then transfer them to a master trust.
The trust will issue the certificates.
Credit support will be provided *-259 by a letter of credit facility from Credit Suisse in favor of the trustee, Fuji Bank & Trust Co., for the benefit of the certificate holders.
J.C. Penney will continue *-1 to service the receivables.
Japan's index of leading indicators rose to 63.6 *ICH*-3 in August, above the so - called boom - or - bust line of 50 for the first time since May, the Economic Planning Agency said *T*-1.
The leading index recovered from July's revised level of 36.6 on strong performances in consumer durables and machinery orders, among other factors, according to an agency spokeswoman.
The index is intended *-1 to measure future economic performance.
A figure above 50 indicates 0 the economy is likely *-1 to expand; one below 50 indicates 0 a contraction may be ahead.
Sun Myung Moon, the Korean evangelist - industrialist who *T*-1 in 1954 founded the Unification Church, remains the mystery man behind a multimillion - dollar political and publishing operation based * in this country and catering to the American right.
But there may be less there than *PRO* meets the eye.
Mr. Moon planned *PRO*-1 to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity--in which he plays the role of Old Testament - style temporal, political messiah *T*-2--and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy.
His original strategy (in itself a brilliant innovation for *PRO* spreading a religion) was *PRO* to create new economic enterprises each time 0 he wanted *PRO*-2 to extend and fund his various religious missions *T*-1.
Tax - exempt airport and street - corner solicitations were intended *-190 only to provide start - up funds.
More stable industries were *PRO* to build an economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America, as they had *?* in Japan and South Korea.
Then he would move his movement to Europe.
But that was not *-1 to be.
Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s spokesmen for both the Unification Church and its opponents in the anticult movement gave wildly exaggerated membership figures.
Their legacy lives on.
It *EXP*-2 is still common *PRO* to read in the press that the church has 10,000 or more full - time American members and 25,000 "associates."
Some estimates have gone as high as 80,000 members.
But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity - seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976 *T*-1, there actually were only about 2,000 full - time Unification Church members in the U.S.
Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate - beleaguered Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for income - tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts.
Defections, burnouts, and abduction "deprogrammings" kept member turnover *PRO*-1 high.
That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the "graying" of the church.
Many of the enthusiastic young "Moonies" of the Nixon era who *T*-224 remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion.
The reputed wealth of the Unification Church is another matter of contention.
For a while in the 1970s it seemed 0 Mr. Moon was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center; a fishing / processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River); shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish - language Noticias del Mundo.
Yet these purchases can be misleading.
Most were obtained *-191 with huge inputs of church money from South Korea and Japan, minimum cash downpayments and sizable mortgages.
Those teams of young fund - raisers selling flowers, peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million *U* a year during the mid - to - late 1970s, but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon's lavish international conferences, speaking tours, and assorted land buys.
Only his factories in Japan and Korea, *PRO*-1 employing his followers at subsistence wages and producing everything from rifles to ginseng to expensive marble vases, kept the money flowing westward.
Virginia Commonwealth University sociologist David Bromley, who *T*-1 more than any other researcher has delved into the complex world of Unificationist finances, has concluded that profitable operations in the U.S. have been the exceptions rather than the rule.
Likewise, journalists John Burgess and Michael Isikoff of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $800 million *U* was transferred *-192 from Japan to the U.S. *PRO* to deal with the church's annual operating losses in this country.
Mr. Moon's two English - language U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain.
Start - up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $50 million *U*, and the total amount lost * in this journalistic black hole was estimated *-193 at $150 million *U* by 1984.
Since then, Moon's organization has inaugurated a pair of high - quality glossy opinion magazines, The World and I and Insight, which *T*-225 are a further drain.
Insiders say that not even their editors know for sure how much these show - piece publications, along with the newspapers, have cost Mr. Moon *T*-1.
Many American church - owned businesses, such as a $30 million *U* factory 0 *T*-1 to build fishing vessels, are defunct.
Some components of the American church had their budgets cut in half last year and again this year.
The relatively small academic conferences that *T*-226 have attracted conservative guests--and press scrutiny--in recent years are much more narrowly targeted and austere than the thousand - person get - togethers in fancy digs and exotic locales of years past.
I attended several of these in the dual role as a presenter of research findings as well as an investigator of my hosts.
(Mr. Moon's Paragon House eventually even published three of my co-edited books on religion and politics.)
According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as Dr. J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, almost all operations are being drastically reduced *-1 as Mr. Moon now concentrates more on *PRO*-2 developing his empire in the Far East.
"Everything," one non - "Moonie" senior consultant to the Unification Church recently told me in an interview *?*, "is going back to Korea and Japan."
(Europe had proved *-1 even less hospitable than North America.
European politicians were less reluctant *PRO*-1 to have their governments investigate and harass new religions.)
So Mr. Moon is in retreat, *PRO*-1 refocusing on the Far East.
South Korea and Japan continue *-1 to be profitable.
Moon's Tong'Il industry conglomerate is now investing heavily in China, where church accountants have high hopes of *PRO* expanding and attracting converts even in the wake of the bloody massacre in Tiananmen Square *T*-1.
Panda Motors is one such investment.
According to senior consultants to the church, Mr. Moon has successfully negotiated a joint venture with the Chinese government 0 *T*-1 to build an automobile - parts plant in Guangdong Province, an area of China with a substantial Korean minority.
Mr. Moon has agreed *PRO*-1 to put up $10 million *U* a year for 25 years and keep the profits in China.
In return, he has the government's blessing *PRO* to build churches and spread Unificationism in that country.
Whatever respectability and ties to intellectuals and opinion - makers 0 the publications and conferences bring *T*-1 really are salvage--not the Rev. Moon's original final goals, but the ones for which he will have *PRO* to settle *T*-2.
Mr. Shupe is co-author (with David G. Bromley) of "` Moonies' in America: Cult, Church, and Crusade" and "Strange Gods: The Great American Cult Scare.
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early December, a move that *T*-257 should give both leaders a political boost at home.
The White House is purposely not calling the meeting *PRO*-1 a summit so that there won't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements.
Rather, senior administration officials said that the unexpected meeting was scheduled *-223 at Mr. Bush's request because of his preference for *PRO* conducting diplomacy through highly personal and informal meetings with other leaders.
The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, *PRO* alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. *RNR*-1 and a Soviet *RNR*-1 naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.
The unusual seaborne meeting won't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer, at which an arms - control treaty is likely *-2 to be completed *-224 *T*-1.
In *PRO* announcing the meeting yesterday, Mr. Bush told reporters at the White House that neither he nor Mr. Gorbachev expects any "substantial decisions or agreements."
Instead, he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get "better acquainted" and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda.
Despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort *PRO* to hold down expectations, the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders.
Mr. Gorbachev badly needs a diversion from the serious economic problems and ethnic unrest 0 he faces *T*-1 at home.
American officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the U.S. could help *PRO*-1 bolster his stature among Soviet politicians and academics, whose support he needs *T*-258.
For his part, Mr. Bush has been criticized *-225 regularly at home for *PRO*-1 moving too slowly and cautiously in *PRO*-2 reacting to Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and the historic moves away from communism in Eastern Europe.
A face - to - face meeting with Mr. Gorbachev should damp such criticism, though it will hardly eliminate it.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), who *T*-259 has been the most prominent Democratic critic of Mr. Bush's handling of the Soviet relationship, praised the president for *PRO*-1 arranging the meeting.
But he added: "The mere fact of a meeting doesn't deal with the substance of policy."
Mr. Bush said that the December meeting, which *T*-1 was announced *-227 simultaneously in Moscow, will be held *-226 in the unusual setting of ships at sea *PRO* to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides *PRO*-228 to limit participation to just small groups of advisers.
"By *PRO*-2 doing it in this manner we can have, I would say, more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption," Mr. Bush said *T*-1.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at a news conference in Moscow, said, "As the two sides plan *PRO*-2 to hold a full - scale summit in late spring - early summer next year, they found it *EXP*-1 useful, I would say even necessary, *PRO* to hold an interim informal meeting."
Although no specific agreements are expected *-228, Mr. Shevardnadze said "that doesn't mean 0 they will be without an agenda."
If the two leaders cover the subjects that *T*-1 have been featured *-229 in lower level U.S. - Soviet meetings, their talks would include human rights, Soviet reforms, regional disputes, relations with allies, economic cooperation, arms control, and joint efforts *PRO* to fight narcotics, terrorism and pollution.
The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic.
Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. *PRO*-1 to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade.
He recently told a small group of American businessmen in Moscow that he hoped *PRO*-2 to sign a general trade agreement with the U.S., possibly at the 1990 summit.
The Soviets hope 0 a trade agreement would give them Most - Favored Nation status, which *T*-260 would lower the tariffs on Soviet exports to the U.S. .
In an unusually candid article about the latest economic woe--unemployment--Pravda yesterday reported that three million Soviets have lost their jobs as a result of perestroika and the number could grow to 16 million by the year 2005.
Economists in Moscow are now proposing that the state start a system of unemployment benefits.
But one Bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against *PRO* assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the Soviet economy or other issues.
"*PRO* Don't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation, or arms control, or the environment," he said *T*-1.
"Those things will all come up, but in a fairly informal way."
Instead, this official said, "This is vintage George Bush.
This was George Bush's own idea.
It's George Bush wanting *PRO*-2 to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly."
Aside from the Soviet economic plight and talks on *PRO* cutting strategic and chemical arms, one other issue 0 the Soviets are likely *-2 to want *PRO*-3 to raise *T*-1 is naval force reductions.
Western analysts say that, given the meeting's setting at sea, Gorbachev is unlikely *-1 to pass up the opportunity *PRO* to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year.
They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans *PRO* to cut land forces--the Soviets' area of greatest strength--the U.S. should show more willingness *PRO* to cut sea forces--Washington's area of greatest superiority.
One of the reasons 0 Bush administration aides are anxious *PRO*-2 to insist that the coming meeting will be informal *T*-1 is *PRO* to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President Reagan's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland.
That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled *-230 into *PRO* discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without *PRO*-1 consulting American allies.
Mr. Bush said that he initiated talks with the Soviets on the informal meeting by *PRO*-3 sending a proposal *ICH*-2 to Mr. Gorbachev last July, which the Soviet leader readily accepted *T*-4.
But word of the possible session was closely held *-1 by the president and a handful of top aides, and word of it didn't reach many second - level officials until the past few days.
Indeed, many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that Mr. Bush wasn't interested in such an informal get - together.
Though President Bush's political critics at home have been urging him *PRO*-1 to open a more direct dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev, it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that *T*-261 led the president *PRO*-262 to seek the December meeting.
Mr. Bush decided 0 he wanted the meeting after *PRO*-3 talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary, who *T*-262 urged him *PRO*-1 to support Mr. Gorbachev's efforts *PRO* to transform the Soviet system and to urge him *PRO*-4 to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe, a senior aide said 0 *T*-2.
While *PRO*-1 flying home from those discussions, Mr. Bush drafted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal get - together 0 *T*-2 to precede their formal summit next year.

The crowning moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant, marble - columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of Cambria County.
Baskets of roses and potted palms adorned his bench.
The local American Legion color guard led the way.
As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe, he was heralded *-128 by a trumpet fanfare.
To many, it was a ceremony more *ICH*-1 befitting a king than a rural judge seated * in the isolated foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.
But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who *T*-155 would be king--and, some say, an arrogant and abusive one.
While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges.
Last March, nine months after the judge's swearing - in, the state attorney general's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of "official oppression" in Cambria County, a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania.
The allegations, *PRO*-1 ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness, paint a disquieting picture.
According to testimony in a public, 80 - page grand - jury report handed * up to the state attorney general, Judge O'Kicki extorted cash from lawyers, muscled favorable loans from banks and bullied local businesses for more than a decade.
Prosecutors, in an indictment based on the grand jury's report, maintain that at various times since 1975, he owned a secret and illegal interest in a beer distributorship; plotted hidden ownership interests in real estate that *T*-156 presented an alleged conflict of interest; set up a dummy corporation 0 *T*-3 to buy a car and obtain insurance for his former girlfriend (now his second wife); and maintained 54 accounts in six banks in Cambria County.
In testimony recorded * in the grand jury report, court employees said 0 the judge, now 59 years old, harassed his secretaries, made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who *T*-157 crossed him.
Bailiffs claimed 0 they were required *-1 *PRO*-3 to chauffeur him to and from work, mow his lawn, chop his wood, fix his car and even drop by his house *PRO*-2 to feed his two grown mutts, Dixie and Husky.
One former bailiff charged that the judge double - crossed him by *PRO*-1 reneging on a promise of a better paying job after *PRO*-2 pocketing a $500 *U* bribe.
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.
Two former secretaries told the grand jury 0 they were summoned *-129 to the judge's chambers on separate occasions *PRO*-129 to take dictation, *PRO*-129 only to find the judge in his bikini underwear.
One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while *PRO*-1 wearing nothing at all.
The judge, *PRO*-2 suspended *-3 from his bench pending his trial, which *T*-158 began this week, vehemently denies all the allegations against him, *PRO*-2 calling them *PRO*-159 "ludicrous" and "imaginative, political demagoguery."
He blames the indictment on local political feuding, unhappiness with his aggressive efforts *PRO* to clear the courthouse's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered * by some of his rulings against them.
"I don't know whose toes I've stepped on *T*-1," says *T*-2 the judge.
"I'll find out, eventually, who *T*-159 pushed the state police buttons into action."
Even if only some of the allegations stand up, however, they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities.
That power can sometimes be abused *-1, particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that *T*-160 serve as corrective measures in urban areas.
Lawyers and their clients who *T*-161 frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect *PRO*-1 to appear before the same judge year after year.
Fear of *PRO* alienating that judge is pervasive, says 0 *T*-1 Maurice Geiger, founder and director of the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, Vt., a public interest group that *T*-162 researches rural justice issues.
As a result, says 0 *?* Mr. Geiger, lawyers think twice before *PRO*-3 appealing a judge's ruling, are reluctant *PRO*-3 to mount *RNR*-1, or even support *RNR*-1, challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath *PRO*-3 to file complaints that *T*-163 might impugn a judge's integrity.
Judge O'Kicki, a stern and forbidding - looking man, has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades.
*PRO*-1 The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised *-1 in a small borough outside Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School.
He graduated near the top of his class, *PRO*-2 serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh, who *T*-164 went on *PRO*-1 to become governor of Pennsylvania and, now, U.S. Attorney General.
It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters *T*-1.
He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk.
Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr. O'Kicki *PRO*-1 one of the finest judges "not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States."
Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments.
After *PRO*-1 practicing law locally, he was elected *-1 to his first 10 - year term as judge in 1971; in 1981, he was effectively re-elected *-2.
Six years ago, Judge O'Kicki was voted *-131 *PRO*-132 president of the Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges by the state's 400 judges.
He has been considered *-132 several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania.
And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983 *T*-1, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him "*PRO*-3 one of the best available," after *PRO*-2 interviewing local lawyers.
"He probably was the smartest guy who *T*-165 ever sat on our bench," says *T*-1 a former president of Cambria County's 150 - member bar association, who *T*-166, like most lawyers in Cambria County, refuses *PRO*-3 to talk about the judge *PPA*-2 publicly.
"He's sharp as a tack.
He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye."
For more than a decade, virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki.
"What about those institutions that *T*-167 are supposed *-2 to be the bedrock of society, the banks and the bar association ...?" wrote *T*-1 a columnist for the Tribune - Democrat, a newspaper in nearby Johnstown, shortly after the scandal became public.
"If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago, the judicial process wouldn't be under the taint 0 it is *T*-1 today."
Officials with the Pennsylvania Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, the arm of the state that *T*-168 investigates judicial misconduct, counter that they had no inkling of anything amiss in Ebensburg.
"Nobody told us; nobody called us," says *T*-1 an official close to the case who *T*-169 asked *PRO*-2 not to be named *-133.
"Nobody had the guts 0 *PRO* to complain *T*-1."
Certainly not the lawyers.
Johnstown attorney Richard J. Green Jr. shelled out $500 *U* in loans to the judge over five years, he said 0 *T*-1 in testimony to the grand jury.
"The judge never made a pretense of *PRO* repaying the money," said *T*-1 Mr. Green.
Eventually, Mr. Green testified 0 *?*, he began *-3 ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited *T*-2.
When Mr. Green won a $240,000 *U* verdict in a land condemnation case against the state *T*-1 in June 1983, he says 0 Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000 *U*.
Mr. Green thought little of it, he told the grand jury 0 *?*, until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback.
"Don't you think 0 I ought *PRO*-2 to get a commission...or part of your fee in this case?" Mr. Green said 0 the judge asked him *T*-1.
*PRO*-2 Appalled, Mr. Green never paid the money, he testified 0 *T*-1.
But he didn't complain to the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, either, *PRO*-1 saying later that he feared retribution.
Mr. O'Kicki said 0 he will respond to Mr. Green's allegation at his trial.
Like most of Cambria County's lawyers and residents who *T*-170 had dealings with the judge, Mr. Green declined *PRO*-1 to be interviewed *-134 for this article.
And no one with a complaint about the judge would allow his name to be printed *-1.
"I don't have anything much 0 *PRO* to say *T*-5, and I think 0 that's what you're going *-3 to find *T*-2 from everyone else 0 you talk to *T*-4 up here," says *T*-1 local attorney Edward F. Peduzzi.
Says *ICH*-1 another lawyer: "The practice of law is a matter of *PRO* biting one's lip when you live in a small community *T*-2.
One had best *-1 not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed *-2 *PRO*-3 tightly shut."
The judge was considered *-137 imperious, abrasive and ambitious, those who *T*-171 practiced before him say 0 *T*-1.
He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high - backed leather chair at his bench, while *PRO*-1 scribbling notes ordering spectators *PRO*-2 to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom.
Four years ago, he jailed all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they defied his order *PRO* to extend the school year by several weeks *PRO*-2 to make up for time lost * during a teachers' strike.
Visitors in his chambers say 0 he could cite precisely the years, months, weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge, *PRO* giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required *PRO* to take over as the county's top court administrator.
The judge, they say 0 *?*, was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments.
"My name is judge," Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in Ebensburg *T*-2 when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984 *T*-1, according to the grand - jury report.
The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name "Judge O'Kicki."
Yet, despite the judge's imperial bearing, no one ever had reason 0 *PRO* to suspect possible wrongdoing *T*-2, says 0 *T*-1 John Bognato, president of Cambria County's 150 - member bar association.
"The arrogance of a judge, his demeanor, the way 0 he handles people *T*-1 are not a basis for *PRO* filing a complaint," says *T*-2 Mr. Bognato.
"Until this came up and hit the press, there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong."
State investigators dispute that view now, particularly in light of the judge's various business dealings in Cambria County.
The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987, after the state attorney general's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County.
The inquiry soon focused on the judge.
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble, according to the grand jury report.
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac - Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago *T*-1, the dealership had "certain apprehensions" about the judge's reputation, according to the grand - jury report.
The dealership took the extra step of *PRO* having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved *-2 by Ebensburg's local lender, Laurel Bank.
Then, as an additional precaution, the car dealership took the judge's photograph *ICH*-1 as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand--proof that he had received the loan documents.
But when the judge received his payment book *T*-1, he disavowed the deal.
"There was no loan, there is no loan, there never shall be a loan," the judge wrote the bank *T*-1 on his judicial stationery, according to the report.
Later, the judge went a step farther.
After Laurel Bank tried *PRO*-1 to repossess the car, a vice president asked him *PRO*-2 to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account.
The judge wrote again.
"I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank, and I am not inclined *PRO*-1 to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned *-138," the judge wrote back *T*-3 in a letter attached * to the grand jury's report.
"Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved *-139 with Laurel bank in the near future, I may be inclined *PRO*-1 to reconsider your request...."
The judge now says 0 it *EXP*-1 was "unfortunate" that he chose *PRO*-2 to write the letter but says "there was certainly no intent *PRO* to extort there."
The bank acquiesced.
It refinanced the judge's loan, lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade - in that *T*-172 hadn't originally been part of the deal--a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation 0 the dealer had *-2 to repair *T*-1 before it could be resold *-140.
The incident wasn't the only time 0 the judge got special treatment from his local bank *T*-1.
Two years later, he wrote *PRO*-2 to complain that the interest 0 he was paying *T*-1 on an unsecured $10,000 *U* loan was "absolutely onerous."
Paul L. Kane, Laurel's president at the time, quickly responded.
The bank, he wrote back 0 *?*, was "immediately" lowering the rate by 3.5%, "as a concession to you."
The judge says 0 he can't discuss in detail how he will defend himself at his trial *T*-1, although he contends that if he were as corrupt as state prosecutors believe *?*, he would be far wealthier than he is *?*.
His seven - bedroom cedar and brick house outside of Johnstown is up for sale *PRO*-1 to pay for his lawyers.
The judge says 0 he is confident 0 he will return to his old bench.
Already, he notes 0 *?*, the 76 charges originally filed against him have been trimmed *-141 to 27.
Most of the allegations no longer pending were ethics charges withdrawn * by state prosecutors as part of a pre-trial agreement.
The heart of the case--"official oppression"--remains intact.
"If I lose, I lose my position, my career, my pension, my home and my investments," says *T*-1 the judge.
"My God and I know 0 I am correct and innocent.
Panhandle Eastern Corp. said 0 it applied, on behalf of two of its subsidiaries, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission *PRO* to build a 352 - mile, $273 million *U* pipeline system from Pittsburg County, Okla., to Independence, Miss.
The natural gas pipeline concern said 0 the 500 million cubic feet a day capacity pipeline would be built *-111 by a proposed joint venture between two Panhandle Eastern units - Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Co.
Texas Eastern Transmission will build and operate the system, which *T*-142 will connect the Arkoma Basin with several interstate pipelines.
Boston Edison Co. said 0 it will take a previously reported $60 million *U* charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
The charge resulted from a settlement approved * yesterday by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.
As *PRO* expected *-1, the settlement limits rate increases for three years and ties future charges to customers for operation of the troubled Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station to that plant's performance.
In its order, the state regulatory agency said 0 the company "must be held *-96 accountable for the mistakes made * in the management of the plant's operation."
Pilgrim had been closed for 32 months.
Yields on savings - type certificates of deposit dropped slightly in the week ended yesterday.
The average yield on a six - month CD of $50,000 *U* or less was 7.90%, compared with 7.94% a week earlier.
The average one - year savings - type CD was down to 7.99% from 8.01%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service that *T*-83 tracks CD yields.
"This week was uneventful for the CD market," said *T*-1 Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.
"The major banks haven't even reacted to sharp rises in the three - month Treasury bill rates" in the past two weeks.
Banks that *T*-84 adjusted payouts on CDs in the most recent week made only fractional moves, he said 0 *T*-1.
The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short - term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday.
The average six - month bill was sold *-60 with a yield of 8.04%, up from 7.90%.
The average three - month issue rose to 8.05% from 7.77%.
Typically, banks offer CD yields higher than those on Treasury bills, which *T*-1 are considered *-61 the safest short - term investments; banks need a competitive edge *PRO*-2 to sell their products.
But when market interest rates move up rapidly *T*-1, increases in bank CD yields sometimes lag.
Most yields on short - term jumbo CDs, those with denominations over $90,000 *U*, also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields.
The average six - month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90%, down from 7.93%, Banxquote said 0 *T*-1.
For longer - term CDs, yields were up.
The average two - year and five - year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91% and 7.96%, respectively.
However, CDs sold * through major broker - dealer networks were up slightly almost across the board.
The average six - month CD in that category added 0.05 percentage point to 8.35%, for example.
Mr. Mehl attributed the rise specifically to the Treasury bill increase.
Among the major banks surveyed * by Banxquote in six regions of the country, 8.33% is the highest yield available.
It is offered *-62 by the flagship banks of New York's Manufacturers Hanover Corp. in the one - year maturity only.
The yield is offered *-63 across a range of maturities at San Francisco's BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co.
Just two weeks ago, BankAmerica's yields in many of those maturities was 8.61%.
Still, on average, the major California banks have the highest yields on CDs, according to Banxquote.
The average yield there on six - month issues is 8.32%.
Robert Q. Marston, president emeritus, University of Florida, and a director of this maker of medical devices, was named *-48 *PRO*-49 chairman.
Dr. Marston, 66 years old, succeeds Alexander T. Daignault, 72, who *T*-73 didn't stand for re-election due to mandatory board retirement policy.
Clarcor Inc. said 0 a plan *PRO* to sell its J.L. Clark Inc. subsidiary to a group headed * by Anderson Industries Inc. for $70.3 million *U* has been terminated *-1.
Clarcor, a maker of packaging and filtration products, said 0 the two companies couldn't agree on terms of a definitive agreement.
The sale price of the unit, which *T*-162 makes packaging products, was *-1 to consist of cash, notes and an amount 0 *T*-2 to be determined *-3 by the unit's future performance.
Clarcor said 0 it is inviting proposals from other prospective purchasers of the unit.
Both Clarcor and Anderson are based *-1 in Rockford, Ill.
Senate leaders traded proposals aimed * at *PRO* speeding action on legislation 0 *T*-1 to narrow the deficit and raise the federal government's debt limit--but the major stumbling block remains President Bush's proposal *PRO* to cut the capital - gains tax rate.
Democrats want the tax provision to be a separate bill, subject to the usual procedural obstacles.
Republicans, meanwhile, want *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to protect the measure by *PRO* combining it with two politically popular issues that Democrats could find *T*-107 hard 0 *PRO*-3 to block *T*-4.
The talks between Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and his GOP counterpart, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, are expected *-1 to resume today.
Last night, after *PRO* meeting with Mr. Bush and administration officials at the White House, Mr. Dole proposed *PRO* streamlining the fiscal 1990 deficit - reduction bill, now stalled in a House - Senate conference committee, and passing a long - term extension of the federal debt ceiling without any accompanying amendments.
Under this plan, two provisions currently in the House version of the deficit - cutting bill--repeal of both the catastrophic - illness insurance program and a controversial 1986 tax provision intended *PRO* to counter discrimination in employee - benefit plans--would be made * into a separate bill.
Republicans would try *PRO*-1 to attach a capital - gains provision to that legislation, *PRO*-1 hoping 0 the political popularity of its other two parts would dissuade Democrats from *PRO* blocking it.
Democrats want *PRO*-1 to avoid *PRO*-2 having *-3 to make that choice by *PRO* making the capital - gains tax cut an individual bill.
Sen. Mitchell is confident 0 he has sufficient votes *PRO* to block such a measure with procedural actions.
Both plans would drop child - care provisions from the House version of the deficit - reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill.
While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. Bush, Democrats argue that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year's congressional elections.
Senate Democrats are *-1 to meet today *PRO*-1 to consider the GOP proposal.
Yesterday, Mr. Dole seemed *-1 weary of the Bush administration's strategy of *PRO* pushing the capital - gains measure at every chance in the face of Democratic procedural hurdles.
*PRO* Pushing the issue on legislation needed * *PRO* to avoid default by the federal government, he told reporters 0 *?*, "doesn't seem *PRO*-3 to be very good strategy to me."
At 12:01 a.m. EST today, the federal government's temporary $2.87 trillion *U* debt limit expired.
*PRO*-1 To avoid default, lawmakers must pass legislation raising the limit to $3.12 trillion *U* from $2.80 trillion *U* by next Wednesday, according to the Treasury.
*PRO*-2 Pressed *-1 by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill .) of the House Ways and Means Committee, Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told a congressional hearing that the administration would give up its demand for the capital - gains tax cut if *PRO*-3 faced with a potential default.
Unocal Corp., Los Angeles, said 0 it and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. would create a petroleum marketing and refining general partnership in the Midwest.
The joint venture, Uno - Ven Co., would generate total annual revenue of about $500 million *U* and have 1,100 employees, a Unocal spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Unocal said 0 the venture would enable it *PRO*-1 to recover more of its refining and marketing investment and prepare for expected growth in exploration, production, chemicals and other areas.
It said 0 financing would consist of $250 million *U* from a private placement obtained * through Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a $150 million *U* revolving credit line underwritten * by Chase Manhattan Bank.
In addition to Unocal's 153,000 barrel - a - day refinery near Lemont, Ill., the new venture would control 17 distribution terminals, a lubricating - oil blending and packaging plant, and 131 company - owned Unocal service stations.
It said 0 the venture, expected *PRO* to take control of the facilities Dec. 1, would also serve another 3,300 independent Unocal gasoline stations.
Petroleos will supply 135,000 barrels of oil a day for the refinery, Unocal said 0 *T*-1.
Paramount Communications Inc., New York, completed the sale of its Associates Corp. consumer and commercial finance subsidiary to a unit of Ford Motor Co. for $3.35 billion *U*.
Paramount, which *T*-25 agreed *PRO*-1 to sell the unit in July, said 0 it would realize net proceeds from the sale of $2.6 billion *U*, with an after - tax gain of $1.2 billion *U*.
Paramount said 0 the gain would be recorded *-1 in its fourth quarter, which *T*-26 ended yesterday.
Paramount said 0 the sale "completes the strategic restructuring" 0 it began *T*-1 in 1983, and would enable it to focus on its entertainment and publishing businesses.
Ford said in July 0 it planned *PRO*-2 to operate Associates, based * in Dallas, as a separate entity in its Ford Financial Services Group.
Paramount said 0 Associates has about $14 billion *U* in total assets, *PRO* making it third - largest in terms of assets among independent finance companies in the U.S. .
Bond prices staggered in seesaw trading, *PRO*-1 rising on reports of economic weakness and falling on reports of economic strength.
Treasury bonds got off to a strong start, *PRO*-1 advancing modestly during overnight trading on foreign markets.
"We saw good buying in Japan and excellent buying in London," said Jay Goldinger, market strategist and trader at Capital Insight Inc., Beverly Hills, Calif.
The market's tempo was helped *-1 by the dollar's resiliency, he said 0 *T*-2.
Late in London, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8410 West German marks and 142.70 Japanese yen, up from late Monday in New York.
British sterling eased to $1.5775 *U* from $1.5825 *U*.
When U.S. trading began *T*-1, Treasury bonds received an additional boost from news that sales of new single - family homes fell 14% in September.
The contraction was twice as large as economists projected and was the sharpest decline since a 19% drop in January 1982.
Economists said 0 the report raised speculation that the economic slowdown could turn into a recession, which *T*-151 would pave the way 0 for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates *T*-1.
But later in the day, a report by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago cast doubt on the recession scenario.
The association said 0 its October index of economic activity rose to 51.6% after *PRO* having been below 50% for three consecutive months.
A reading below 50% indicates that the manufacturing industry is slowing while a reading above 50% suggests that the industry is expanding.
Bond prices fell after the Chicago report was released *-1.
By the end of the day, bond prices were mixed.
The benchmark 30 - year bond was nearly 1/4 point higher, or up about $2.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
New two - year notes ended unchanged while three - year and four - year notes were slightly lower.
Municipal bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/2 point higher while mortgage - backed securities were up about 1/8 point.
Corporate bonds were unchanged.
In the corporate market, an expected debt offering today by International Business Machines Corp. generated considerable attention.
The giant computer maker is slated *-1 *PRO*-2 to offer $500 million *U* of 30 - year non-callable debentures through underwriters led * by Salomon Brothers Inc.
Traders expect the bonds to yield about 0.60 to 0.65 percentage point above the Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond, which *T*-152 ended Tuesday with a yield of about 7.90%.
The last time 0 IBM tapped the corporate debt market *T*-2 was in April 1988, when it offered $500 million *U* of debt securities *T*-1.
IBM's visits to the debt market are closely watched *-1 by treasurers at other corporations and by credit market analysts.
Some analysts believe 0 the company has the ability *PRO* to pinpoint the trough in interest - rate cycles.
In October 1979, just days before the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, IBM offered $1 billion *U* in debt securities.
The boost in rates sent IBM's bonds *PRO*-2 tumbling, *PRO*-1 leaving underwriters with millions of dollars of losses and triggering a sell - off in the overall market.
The company "can't be bullish if they're doing a sizable 30 - year bullet," said 0 *T*-1 one analyst.
Others said 0 IBM might increase the size of the offering to as much as $1 billion *U* if investor demand is strong.
The company has $1 billion *U* in debt filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"I think 0 the $500 million *U* is a little bit of a fire drill," said *T*-1 Jim Ednee, head of the industrial bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
"I think 0 as the pricing time arrives, the bonds will come *PRO* a little richer and in a larger amount."
Treasury Securities
Treasury prices ended mixed in light trading.
The benchmark 30 - year bond was quoted *-1 late at 102 12/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.90% compared with 102 7/32 0 *T*-3 to yield 7.92% Monday.
The latest 10 - year notes were unchanged at 100 16/32 0 *T*-1 to yield 7.904%.
Short - term rates also were mixed.
The discount rate on three - month Treasury bills rose slightly from the average rate at Monday's auction to 7.79% for a bond - equivalent yield of 8.04%.
The discount rate on six - month Treasury bills fell slightly to 7.60% for a bond - equivalent yield of 7.99%.
Corporate Issues
Two junk bond issues were priced *-1 yesterday, including a scaled - backed offering by Beatrice Co.
A spokesman for underwriters Salomon Brothers Inc. said 0 Beatrice cut its high - yield offering to $251 million *U* from a planned $350 million *U* after it *EXP*-2 became clear 0 the company would have *-1 to give investors higher yields.
In the two - part offering, $151 million *U* of senior subordinated reset notes were priced *-1 at 99.75 and carried a rate of 13 3/4%, while the $100 million *U* of senior subordinated floating rate notes were priced *PRO*-2 to float at 4.25 percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR.
The one - year LIBOR rate yesterday was 8 7/16%.
Since the recent deterioration of the junk - bond market, at least two other junk issuers have said 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to scale back planned high - yield offerings, and several issues have been postponed *-2.
William Carmichael, Beatrice chief financial officer, said 0 favorable market conditions in September prompted the company *PRO*-1 to plan more debt than necessary.
"However, given the changes in the market conditions that *T*-153 have occurred since then, we decided *PRO*-1 to sell only the amount needed * *PRO* to proceed with our contemplated recapitalization," he said *T*-2.
Under the firm's original bank credit agreement, it was required *-1 *PRO*-5 to raise $250 million *U* of subordinated debt 0 *T*-2 to be used *-3 *PRO* to repay some of the bank borrowings drawn *PRO* to redeem $526.3 million *U* of increasing rate debentures in August.
A month ago, when Beatrice first filed *PRO*-1 to sell debt *T*-3, the company had planned *PRO*-2 to offer $200 million *U* of its senior subordinated reset notes at a yield of 12 3/4%.
The $150 million *U* in senior subordinated floating - rate notes were targeted *PRO*-1 to be offered *-2 at a price *PRO*-2 to float four percentage points above the three - month LIBOR.
By October, however, market conditions had deteriorated and the reset notes were targeted *PRO*-1 to be offered *-2 at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2%.
Mr. Carmichael said 0 investors also demanded stricter convenants.
Continental Cablevision Inc., via underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co., priced $350 million *U* of junk bonds at par *PRO* to yield 12 7/8%.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
J.C. Penney & Co. issued $350 million *U* of securities backed * by credit - card receivables.
The securities were priced *-1 at 99.1875 *PRO* to yield about 9.19%.
Underwriters at First Boston Corp. said 0 the J.C. Penney credit - card securities are the first with a 10 - year average life, which *T*-154 is much longer than previous such issues.
Elsewhere, Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery was quoted *-1 at 98 18/32 bid *, up 5/32 from late Monday, *PRO* to yield about 9.333% to a 12 - year average life assumption.
Freddie Mac's 9 1/2% issue was quoted *-1 at 99 20/32, up 3/32 from Monday.
Fannie Mae's 9% issue was at 98 7/32, up 1/8.
On the pricing front, an 11 - class issue of $500 million *U* Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Remic mortgage securities was launched *-1 by a Morgan Stanley group.
The offering is backed *-1 by Freddie Mac's 10% issue with a weighted average term to maturity of 29.583 months.
Municipal Issues
Municipal bonds were little changed to 1/2 point higher in late dealings.
"We were oversold *-1 and today we bounced back.
Some accounts came in for some blocks in the secondary {market}, which we haven't seen *T*-1 for a while," said *T*-2 one trader.
"There were no {sell} lists and the calendar is lightening up a bit.
There's light at the end of the tunnel for municipals," he said *T*-2, *-1 adding that he expects prices to "inch up" in the near term.
The market's tone improved after Monday's pricing of $813 million *U* New York City general obligation bonds.
The issue's smooth absorption eased fears that supply would overwhelm demand in coming sessions, traders said 0 *T*-1.
Demand for the bonds was strong enough *PRO* to permit underwriters *PRO*-1 to trim some yields in the tax - exempt portion of the offering late Monday.
A two - part $75.1 million *U* offering of wastewater treatment bonds by the New Jersey Wastewater Treatment Trust was more than half sold *-1 by late in the session, according to lead underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The debt was reoffered *-1 *PRO*-1 priced *PRO*-2 to yield from 6% in 1991 to 7.15% in 2008 - 2009.
Foreign Bonds
Most foreign government bonds markets were quiet.
West German bonds firmed a bit after Monday's fall, but traders said 0 the market remains bearish due to speculation that interest rates could rise again.
In a speech given * Friday but released * late Monday, Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger suggested that it *EXP*-1 was risky *PRO* to claim that the booming German economy has reached the peak of its cycle.
His comments were interpreted *-1 as a sign that higher interest rates are possible.
On Oct. 5, the Bundesbank raised the Lombard and discount rates by one percentage point to 8% and 6% *U*, respectively, the highest levels in seven years.
Germany's 7% bond due October 1999 was unchanged at 99.35 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.09% while the 6 3/4% notes due July 1994 rose 0.025 point to 97.275 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.445%.
Japanese government bonds showed little change.
Japan's benchmark No. 111 issue due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.90, down 0.02 point, *PRO*-1 to yield 5.435%.
British government bonds were little changed as investors awaited an address on economic policy by John Major, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003 / 2007 rose 2/32 to 111 1/2 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.14% while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 21/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 12.95%.
*PRO*-1 Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders, the New York Stock Exchange is considering *PRO*-1 reinstituting a "collar" on program trading that it abandoned *T*-134 last year, according to people familiar with the Big Board.
The exchange also may step up its disclosure of firms engaged * in program trading, these people said 0 *T*-1.
Big Board officials wouldn't comment publicly.
But in an interview in which he called the stock market's volatility *PRO*-6 a "national problem *T*-3," Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said, "We are going *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to do some things 0 *ICH*-4 in the short intermediate term" *T*-5 to help the situation.
Mr. Phelan has been viewed *-1 by many exchange members as *PRO* being indifferent to stock - price swings caused * by program trades.
He said 0 he is "very surprised" by the furor over program trading and the exchange's role in it that *T*-135 has raged in recent days.
Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying *PRO*-1 to deal quietly with the issue, but that *PRO* banning computer - assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like "*PRO* taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse."
The exchange has a board meeting scheduled * for tomorrow, and it is expected that some public announcement could be made *-1 after that.
Big Board officials have been under seige from both investors and the exchange's own floor traders since the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 190 - point tumble on Oct. 13.
Mr. Phelan hasn't been making public remarks in recent days, and many people have urged him *PRO*-1 to take more of a leadership role on the program trading issue.
What the Big Board is considering *T*-1 is re-establishing a "collar" on program trading when the market moves significantly *T*-2.
Early last year, after a 140 - point, one - day drop in the Dow, the Big Board instituted the collar, which *T*-136 banned program trading through the Big Board's computers whenever the Dow moved 50 points up or down in a day *T*-1.
It didn't work.
"The collar was penetrated *-1 on a number of occasions," *PRO* meaning 0 securities firms figured out ways 0 *PRO* to conduct program trades *PRO* to circumvent the collar and use the Big Board's electronic trading system *T*-2, Mr. Phelan said 0 *T*-3.
That was when the exchange took a new tack by *PRO*-2 publishing monthly statistics listing the top 15 program trading firms *T*-1.
Exchange officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions 0 *PRO* to deal with program trading *T*-1.
People familiar with the exchange said 0 another idea likely *PRO* to be approved *-1 is *PRO* expanding the monthly reports on program trading *PRO*-2 to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who *T*-137 was doing it.
Meanwhile, another big Wall Street brokerage firm joined others that *T*-138 have been pulling back from program trading.
American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit said 0 it ceased all index - arbitrage program trading for client accounts.
In stock - index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stock with offsetting trades in stock - index futures *PRO*-1 to profit from fleeting price discrepancies between the two markets.
Shearson, which in September *T*-1 was the 11th - biggest program trader on the Big Board, had already suspended stock - index arbitrage for its own account.
Also, CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit, the fifth - biggest program trader in September, is "preparing a response" to the program - trading outcry, officials of the firm said 0 *T*-1.
First Boston is one of the few major Wall Street firms that *T*-139 haven't pulled back from program trading in recent days.
Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally *T*-1 appears *-2 to be solidly in control of the Big Board's factions.
But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading.
Mr. Phelan's recent remarks that investors simply must get used to the stock - market volatility from program trading have drawn criticism from both the exchange's stock specialists, who *T*-140 make markets in individual stocks, and from many companies that *T*-141 have shares listed * on the Big Board.
Mr. Phelan said that his predicting continued volatility is just "how the world is *T*-1.
If *PRO* bringing the message is a crime, I'm guilty of it."
But he said 0 this doesn't mean 0 he is satisfied with the market's big swings.
"We're trying *PRO*-1 to take care of a heck of a lot of constituents," Mr. Phelan said *T*-2.
"Each one has a different agenda."
For example, in a special meeting Monday with Mr. Phelan, senior officials of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests.
"We are looking for representation 0 we haven't had *T*-1," a specialist said *T*-2.
"We've had dictation."
After another session 0 Mr. Phelan held *T*-1 yesterday with major brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and First Boston--all of which *T*-142 have engaged in program trading--an executive of a top brokerage firm said, "Clearly, the firms want the exchange to take leadership."
Many specialist firms resent the Big Board's new "basket" product that *T*-143 allows institutions to buy or sell all stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index in one shot.
Ultimately, the specialists view this as yet another step toward electronic trading that *T*-144 could eventually destroy their franchise.
"His {Phelan's} own interests are in *PRO* building an electronic marketplace," said *T*-1 a market maker.
The basket product, while it has got off to a slow start, is being supported *-1 by some big brokerage firms--another member of Mr. Phelan's splintered constituency.
Mr. Phelan has had difficulty *PRO* convincing the public that the Big Board is serious about *PRO* curbing volatility, especially as the exchange clearly relishes its role as the home for $200 billion *U* in stock - index funds, which *T*-145 buy huge baskets of stocks *PRO* to mimic popular stock - market indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500, and which sometimes *T*-146 employ program trading.
The Big Board wants *PRO*-1 to keep such index funds from *PRO* fleeing to overseas markets, but only as long as it "handles it intelligently," Mr. Phelan said *T*-2.
Despite what some investors are suggesting *T*-2, the Big Board isn't even considering a total ban on program trading or stock futures, exchange officials said 0 *T*-1.
Most revisions 0 it will propose *T*-1 will be geared *-2 toward *PRO* slowing down program trading during stressful periods, said 0 *T*-3 officials working with the exchange.
Computers have made trading more rapid, but that can be fixed *-1 with some fine - tuning.
"I think 0 if you {can} speed things up, you can slow them down," Mr. Phelan said *T*-1.
"That's different than *PRO* wrecking them."
While volatility won't go away, he said 0 *?*, "Volatility is greater than program trading.
What I'm trying *PRO*-1 to say *T*-3 to people is, 0 it *EXP*-2's proper *PRO* to worry about program trading, but it's only a piece of the business."
For example, Mr. Phelan said that big institutions have so much control over public investments that they can cause big swings in the market, regardless of index arbitrage.
"A lot of people would like *PRO*-2 to go back to 1970," before program trading, he said 0 *T*-1.
"I would like *PRO*-1 to go back to 1970.
But we're not going back to 1970."
Indeed, Mr. Phelan said that if stock - market volatility persists, the U.S. may lose its edge as *PRO* being the best place 0 *PRO* to raise capital *T*-1.
"Japan's markets are more stable," he said *T*-1.
"If that continues, a significant number of {U.S. .} companies will go over there *PRO*-1 to raise money."
In coming days, when the Big Board formulates its responses to the program - trading problem *T*-1, Mr. Phelan may take a more public role in the issue.
Lewis L. Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said: "This is a problem that *T*-147's taking on a life of its own.
The program trading situation seems *-1 to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market, and even Europeans are suspicious.
The exchange should take a pro-active position."
For now, however, Mr. Phelan said: "I refuse *PRO*-1 to get out there and tell everybody 0 everything is hunky - dory.
We have a major problem, and that problem is volatility."

MCI Communications Corp. said 0 it won a $27 million *U* contract *ICH*-1 from Stuart - James Co., a Denver investment banking concern, *PRO* to provide voice and data telecommunications services.
The agreement calls for MCI to provide data service, 800 and Vnet service, a virtual private network service.
The companies wouldn't disclose the length of the contract except *PRO*-1 to say 0 it was a multiyear agreement.
Federal and state thrift examiners said 0 they saw evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the collapse of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, and a California regulator described an attempted "whitewash" by deputies of chief federal regulator Danny Wall.
In a riveting day of hearings before the House Banking Committee, the examiners described *PRO* finding shredded documents, a mysterious Panamanian subsidiary, millions of dollars funneled * into a Swiss bank, and a complacent attitude by Mr. Wall's deputies, one of whom *T*-1 was portrayed *-2 as *PRO* acting more like a public - relations man for the thrift than a federal regulator.
A California official also said 0 he sent the Federal Bureau of Investigation a packet of documents relating to a previously reported $400,000 *U* contribution from Lincoln's parent solicited * by Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif .).
Federal examiner Alex Barabolak said 0 Lincoln's operations amounted to "*PRO* pyramiding debt *PRO* to provide a luxurious life style for its owners."
Another federal examiner, John Meek, said 0 Lincoln's principal owner, Charles Keating Jr., and his family drew off at least $34 million *U* from the thrift in salaries, bonuses and proceeds from securities sales in the 3 1/2 years before federal authorities seized it earlier this year.
Lincoln's collapse may cost taxpayers as much as $2.5 billion *U*, according to estimates, *PRO* making it the most expensive thrift failure in history.
"I think 0 there's overwhelming evidence 0 *T*-1 to indicate probable criminal activity," said *T*-2 Mr. Meek, who *T*-91 participated last year in an examination of the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
He said 0 the evidence pointed to wrongdoing by Mr. Keating "and others," although he didn't allege any specific violation.
Richard Newsom, a California state official who last year *T*-92 examined Lincoln's parent, American Continental Corp., said 0 he also saw evidence that crimes had been committed *-1.
"It sure smells like it," he said *T*-1.
He said 0 30% of the loans 0 he sampled *T*-1 were "dead meat on the day 0 they were made *-3 *T*-2."
The state examiner also said 0 supervisors of a parallel federal examination seemed *-1 so reluctant *PRO*-2 to demand write - downs of Lincoln's bad loans that he immediately grew suspicious.
"Later on, my concerns about a whitewash became even more serious," he said *T*-1.
He called the sour loans "*PRO*-1 appalling" and added, "You opened the file up and it just jumped at you."
Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney for Lincoln's parent corporation, said in an interview, "We deny any criminal behavior by the association or its officers."
"Those who *T*-93 testified {yesterday} have consistently maintained that anyone who *T*-94 didn't agree with them is part of a coverup, a whitewash, or the subject of excessive influence," Mr. Bickwit said *T*-1.
"We simply don't agree with that or the findings of their investigation."
Mr. Wall's deputies complained that they hadn't been given *-1 an opportunity *PRO* to respond to the criticism brought out during the Banking Committee's hearings, which Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) has used *T*-2 as a forum *PRO*-3 to flay Mr. Wall's handling of the affair and to demand that he step aside from his job.
"A couple of things 0 Mr. Newsom said *T*-1 were at least misleading," said *T*-2 Kevin O'Connell, one of the Washington regulators responsible for the handling of Lincoln.
In an interview, he said 0 federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans 0 the state regulator cited *T*-1 to be a total loss, and forced Lincoln *PRO*-2 to make an $18 million *U* downward adjustment on another.
"Our response to the whitewash would simply be, 0 *PRO* look what *T*-95 happened," another Washington official, Alvin Smuzynski, said *T*-1 in an interview.
Federal officials seized the association in April, a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy - law proceedings.
The government later brought a $1.1 billion *U* fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others.
Rep. Gonzalez has complained that regulators waited far too long, however, *PRO*-1 ignoring a recommendation *ICH*-2 from regional officials *PRO* to place Lincoln into receivership two years before it failed.
"He took the reckless course of *PRO* ignoring the evidence," Rep. Gonzalez said *T*-1.
State thrift examiner Eugene Stelzer said 0 he found the chief federal examiner Steve Scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions.
"Frankly, it was like he worked for the Lincoln public - relations department," Mr. Stelzer testified *T*-1.
And David Riley, a federal examiner who *T*-96 worked under Mr. Scott, said 0 he found his chief oddly upbeat about Lincoln.
*PRO*-1 Asked *PRO*-2 to comment, a spokesman for Mr. Scott said: "Mr. Scott has spoken to his attorney, who *T*-97 has advised him not to talk to anybody."
Mr. Meek said that a day or two before Lincoln's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, he and other examiners saw "a truck with a sign on it that *T*-98 said 0 it was from the ` Document Destruction Center . '
We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded *-1 into this truck."
Mr. Bickwit said 0 the paper had been donated *-1 to "a charitable organization that *T*-99 sells it for recycling.
They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors."
Mr. Meek said 0 his suspicions were aroused *-1 by several foreign investments by Lincoln, including $22 million *U* paid * to Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an $18 million *U* interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris, a $17.5 million *U* investment in a Bahamas trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama - based company, Southbrook Holdings.
Mr. Bickwit said, "I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities *T*-2," but said 0 the overseas investments "essentially broke even" for the S&L.
Avery Inc. said 0 it completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. to a group led * by management of Uniroyal Chemical Co., the unit's main business.
It valued the transaction at $800 million *U*.
Avery, which *T*-160 continues *-1 to operate a coal company 0 it expects *PRO*-3 to sell *T*-2 at a loss, said in proxy materials 0 it intends *PRO*-4 to seek control of one or more companies.
After fees and repayment of debt, Avery is left *-1 with about $24 million *U* in cash and securities from the Uniroyal sale.
Avery paid $750 million *U*, including various legal and financing fees, *PRO*-1 to acquire Uniroyal Chemical, Middlebury, Conn., in 1986--a move that *T*-161 burdened Avery with debt.
In over - the - counter trading, Avery shares were quoted *-1 yesterday at a bid price of 93.75 cents a share.
According to Avery, for the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, Uniroyal Chemical had sales of $734.2 million *U* and a net loss of $47.1 million *U*.
An Avery spokesman said that the loss was magnified *-1 by accounting adjustments and that the company's loss was smaller on a cash basis.
Uniroyal has 2,600 employees and facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Italy and Taiwan.
In a related development, Avery said 0 it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers, Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May, surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery's common shares *T*-1.
On a fully diluted basis, the two raised their stake to 68% from 51%.
In December 1988, Messrs. Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc., a packaging company 0 they controlled *T*-1, to Pechiney Corp. of France.
The executives had profited handsomely by *PRO* building American National Can Co., Triangle's chief asset.
In January 1989, the two men acquired the non-packaging assets of Triangle, including a controlling stake in Avery and, by extension, Uniroyal Chemical.
In the August proxy material, Avery said that unless it sold Uniroyal, its ability *PRO* to service debt would be hurt *-1 and Avery's shareholder value would "continue *-2 to erode."
Until Avery makes an acquisition, Messrs. Peltz and May will waive their direct salaries and bonuses, the company said 0 *T*-1.
For at least the next six months, however, Avery will continue *-1 to pay $200,000 *U* a month for management services to a company controlled * by Messrs. Peltz and May, according to the proxy material.
J.C. Penney Co. is extending its involvement in a televised home - shopping service by five to 10 years.
Shop Television Network Inc., of Los Angeles, said 0 Penney agreed *PRO*-1 to continue its exclusive arrangement with Shop Television, which *T*-103 does the production, marketing and cable distribution for the J.C. Penney Television Shopping Channel.
The channel reaches 6.5 million homes, a Penney spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Michael Rosen, president of Shop Television, said 0 Penney decided *PRO*-1 to extend its involvement with the service for at least five years.
If, by that time, the network reaches 14 million homes, the contract will be renewed *-1 for five more years.
Earlier this year, Penney abandoned another home shopping venture, Telaction Corp., after *PRO*-1 investing $106 million *U* in it.
The company took a $20 million *U* charge *ICH*-1 in the fiscal first quarter ended * April 29, related to *PRO* discontinuing the service.
The head trader of Chemical Banking Corp.'s interest - rate options group has left the company, following valuation errors that *T*-9 resulted in a $33 million *U* charge against its third - quarter results.
Chemical said 0 Steven Edelson resigned recently, but one individual close to the situation said 0 the resignation was forced *-1.
Mr. Edelson couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
A separate inquiry by Chemical cleared Mr. Edelson of allegations that he had been lavishly entertained *-1 by a New York money broker.
That inquiry hasn't resolved similar allegations involving another Chemical options trader.
In other personnel changes stemming from problems in its options unit:
-- Chemical named James Kennedy, a trader in swaps contracts for the bank, *PRO*-1 to assume Mr. Edelson's duties and to be trading manager for derivative products, including swaps and interest - rate options.
-- Lee Wakeman, vice president in charge of options research who *T*-10 discovered the valuation errors and was asked by senior management *-1 *PRO*-11 to straighten out the mess, resigned *PRO*-2 to take a position in asset and liability management at Continental Bank in Chicago.
Mr. Wakeman, whom Chemical tried *PRO*-1 to keep *T*-2, didn't return calls for comment.
Separately, Chemical confirmed that it took an undisclosed charge *ICH*-1 in the second quarter for losses on forward - rate agreements involving foreign currency written * by its branch in Frankfurt, West Germany.
A Chemical spokeswoman said 0 the second - quarter charge was "not material" and that no personnel changes were made *-1 as a result.
The spokeswoman said 0 the Frankfurt situation was "totally different" from problems in the interest - rate options unit.
According to individuals familiar with the situation, the Frankfurt loss stemmed from a computer program for *PRO* calculating prices on forward - rate agreements that *T*-11 failed *-2 to envision an interest - rate environment where short - term rates were equal to *RNR*-1 or higher than *RNR*-1 long - term rates *T*-3.
While the incidents involving interest - rate options and forward - rate agreements are unrelated, some observers say 0 they echo a 1987 incident in which Bankers Trust New York Corp. restated the value of its foreign exchange options contracts downward by about $80 million *U* *T*-1.
These complex products require close monitoring because each must be valued *-1 separately in light of current market conditions.
In an interest - rate options contract, a client pays a fee to a bank for custom - tailored protection against adverse interest - rate swings for a specified period.
In a forward - rate agreement, a client agrees to an exchange rate on a future currency transaction.
Some competitors maintain 0 the interestrate option loss, in particular, may have resulted more from Chemical's taking large and often contrarian positions than a valuation problem.
*PRO*-1 Started *-2 three years ago, Chemical's interest - rate options group was a leading force in the field.
From 1987 to 1988, the value of Chemical's option contracts outstanding mushroomed to $37 billion *U* from $17 billion *U*.
More importantly, the volume of options written * exceeded those purchased * by almost 2 - to - 1.
With such a lopsided book of options, traders say 0 *?*, Chemical was more vulnerable to erroneous valuation assumptions.
The Chemical spokeswoman said 0 the bank has examined its methodologies and internal controls.
"We consider our internal controls to have worked well," she said *T*-1, *PRO*-2 adding that some procedures have been strengthened *-3.
Its valuation methodologies, she said 0 *?*, "are recognized *-2 as some of the best on the Street.
Not a lot was needed *-1 to be done *-2.
Private industry's labor costs rose 1.2% in the third quarter, *PRO* matching the second - quarter pace, as health insurance costs continued *-1 to soar, the Labor Department said 0 *T*-2.
The increase in wage and benefit costs in the third quarter was greater than the 1% rise reported * for the third quarter of 1988.
"Wage increases and overall compensation increases are beginning *-1 to curl upward a little bit," said *T*-2 Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization.
"One would have thought 0 this would have happened two or three years ago as the labor market tightened.
It is a considerably delayed reaction and it's not a severe one at all," she added *T*-1.
The new data underscored the severity of the nation's health - care cost problem.
In the 12 months ended * in September, wages and salaries of private - sector workers rose 4.4%, while health insurance costs spurted by 13.7%.
The consumer price index climbed 4.3% in the same period.
Despite the big increases in health - care costs, wages still account for a far greater share of overall labor costs.
The overall private - sector employment cost index, which *T*-49 includes both wages and benefits, rose 4.7% in the 12 months ended * in September, compared with 4.5% for both the 12 months ended * in June and the 12 months ended * September 1988.
Labor costs are climbing at a far more rapid pace in the health care industry than in other industries.
For instance, wages of private - sector hospital workers leaped 6.6% in the 12 months ended * in September, compared with 4.4% for workers in all industries.
In the third quarter, wages and salaries in all private industry rose 1.2%, compared with 1% increases in both the second quarter and in the third quarter of 1988.
For the past five years, unions haven't managed *PRO*-1 to win wage increases as large as those granted * to nonunion workers.
For private - sector union workers, the cost of wages and benefits rose 0.9% in the third quarter.
For nonunion workers, the costs rose 1.4%.
Labor costs continued *-1 to rise more rapidly in service industries than in goods - producing industries, the report showed 0 *T*-2.
It also found them rising much more in the Northeast than elsewhere.
Including employees of state and local--but not the federal--governments, the employment cost index rose 1.6% in the third quarter, compared with a 1.3% rise in the same quarter in 1988.
The index rose 1.1% in the second quarter.
For the 12 months ended * in September, this index was up 5.1%.
It rose 4.8% for the 12 months ended * in June and 4.7% in the 12 months ended * in September 1988.
Unlike most economic indicators, none of these figures are adjusted *-1 for seasonal variations.

It *EXP*-2 never ceases *PRO*-1 to amaze me how the business world continues *-3 to trivialize the world's environmental problems *T*-4 ("Is Science, or Private Gain, Driving Ozone Policy?" by George Melloan, Business World, Oct. 24).
*PRO* To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted.
*PRO* Consider the fact that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by *PRO*-1 allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure.
Even a small reduction is unacceptable and *PRO* to suggest otherwise is penny - wise and pound - foolish.
The reason 0 environmentalists "don't mind *PRO*-1 seeing new crises arise *T*-2" is because there are new crises.
Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were *?* 10 years ago.
If you are doubtful, *PRO* consider for a moment that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey, which *T*-170 supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled *-1 with toxic PCBs.
This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group's ploy *PRO* to create a market.
It's time 0 business leaders and the general public learn that mankind does not rule over this natural environment but is rather the integral, symbiotic player within nature's workings *T*-1.
Mark T. Kuiper Jersey City, N.J.
Mr. Melloan's column was right on the money, but I wish 0 it could have gone one step further.
As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in *PRO* dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland - Molina theory (named * after the researchers who *T*-171 found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol.
An important part of my effort has been *PRO* to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design.
In my research, I have found a paper by Joseph Scotto of the National Cancer Institute and several colleagues reporting an 11 - year decrease in UV - B radiation at eight U.S. measurement sites.
Our concern for the ozone layer, of course, grows out of the potential for increasing UV - B radiation, which *T*-172 could damage flora and fauna.
The last of the measurements reported * was in 1985, but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend.
I understand *RNR*-1, but haven't yet verified *RNR*-1, that there are studies by Norwegians, Russians and the Max Planck Institute that *T*-173 show either unchanging or declining UV - B at the surface.
To me, this calls into question the validity of the Rowland - Molina theory and hence the whole chlorofluorocarbons replacement effort.
This, in turn, threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written *T*-1.
My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted *-1 with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited *.
When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV - B study *T*-1, I was urged *-2 *PRO*-176 to get back to the agenda topic, which *T*-174 was, ironically, a schedule for *PRO* getting rid of HCFCs, the so - called soft CFCs that *T*-175 are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario.
Subsequently, I have learned that a private group, of which Du Pont is a part *T*-1, is funding a modest program *PRO* to continue data gathering at the Scotto report stations as well as to develop more sophisticated UVB measuring instruments.
But this is almost an underground activity.
To my knowledge, no government entities, including the EPA, are pursuing UV - B measurements.
The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion "establishment" meetings, of which I have attended many *T*-1.
It seems to me that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed * by CFCs.
While *PRO*-1 recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened, I intend *PRO*-1 to urge that UV - B be monitored *-2 whenever I can *?* *T*-3.

The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified *-1 back in 1974.
Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now.
The discovery of the ozone "hole" over Antarctica and the results of ground - based and high - altitude aircraft experiments conducted * over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related *-1 to CFC concentrations.
In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J. Crutzen, director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, wrote, "It *EXP*-1 is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons, particularly CFC - 11 and CFC - 12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion."
Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. *PRO* to support his statement.
However, unlike Messrs. Graedel and Crutzen, who *T*-176 are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area.
He is a mechanical engineer, not an atmospheric chemist.
It *EXP*-1 is insulting and demeaning *PRO* to say that scientists "needed new crises *PRO* to generate new grants and contracts" and that environmental groups need them *PRO*-2 to stay in business.
*PRO* Solving the global environmental problems 0 we all face *T*-1 will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry, policy makers and the scientific community world - wide.

Sanwa Shutter Corp. said 0 its affiliated company in Malaysia, established * this April, will begin *-1 manufacturing steel doors Wednesday.
Its partner in the joint venture is Sin Kean Boon Metal Industries, Penang, Malaysia.
Company officials said 0 the new company, Sin Kean Boon - Sanwa (J.V .) is capitalized *-1 at the equivalent of 54 million yen ($381,000 *U*).
The Japanese concern has a 40% stake, while the local partner has a 60% stake.
The new company was created *-1 *PRO* to meet growing demand for steel doors, concurrent with increasing local concern about fire prevention, the company said 0 *T*-2.
Lyphomed Inc., Rosemont, Ill., and Medco Research Inc., Los Angeles, said 0 the Food and Drug Administration granted full marketing approval for a new drug for the treatment of a condition in which the heart beats between 150 and 200 beats a minute *T*-1.
The condition, known * as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, leads to dizziness and fainting.
The typical healthy heart beats 70 times a minute.
The drug, called *PRO* *PRO*-1 adenocard, returns the heart to a normal rhythm within seconds, according to Lyphomed.
Medco Research developed the drug and licensed it to Lyphomed for sale in the U.S. and Canada.
Stelco Inc. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to shut down three Toronto - area plants, *PRO*-1 moving their fastener operations to a leased facility in Brantford, Ontario.
The company said 0 the fastener business "has been under severe cost pressures for some time."
The fasteners, nuts and bolts, are sold *-1 to the North American auto market.
A company spokesman declined *PRO*-1 to estimate the impact of the closures on earnings.
He said 0 the new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees.
The steelmaker employs about 16,000 people.
Stelco said 0 it has an option *PRO* to lease a 350,000 - square - foot building in Brantford and proposes *PRO*-1 to spend 24.5 million Canadian dollars (US$20.9 million *U*) on the facility.
The three existing plants and their land will be sold *-1.
You'd think 0 all the stories about well - heeled communities and developers getting HUD grants would prompt Congress *PRO*-1 to tighten up on upscale housing subsidies.
No way.
Congress has just made it *EXP*-1 easier for the affluent *PRO* to qualify for insured loans from the deficit - ridden Federal Housing Administration.
It appears that the only thing 0 Congress is learning *T*-1 from the HUD story is how *PRO* to enlarge its control of the honey pot going to special interests *T*-2.
Right now, the largest loan 0 the FHA can insure *T*-1 in high - cost housing markets is $101,250 *U*.
Last week, housing lobbies persuaded Congress *PRO*-1 to raise the ceiling to $124,875 *U*, *PRO* making FHA loans more accessible to the well - to - do.
But it does that at the cost of *PRO* deepening the taxpayer's exposure if the FHA is forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to pay for more loans going sour.
This is no idle fear last year the FHA lost $4.2 billion *U* in loan defaults.
But the higher mortgage ceiling is only the starter kit for what Senator Alan Cranston and Majority Leader George Mitchell have *T*-1 in mind for housing.
The Senate Banking Committee will begin hearings *ICH*-1 next week on their proposal *PRO* to expand existing federal housing programs.
Other Senators want *PRO*-1 to lower the down payments required * on FHA - insured loans.
That would be a formula for *PRO* ensuring even more FHA red ink.
Experience has shown that the most important element in *PRO* predicting a housing - loan default is the down payment.
Because a purchaser can use an FHA loan *PRO*-2 to finance all points and closing costs, the FHA can wind up *PRO*-1 lending more than a house is worth.
If housing prices continue *-1 to fall, many borrowers would be better off *PRO*-2 walking away from their homes and leaving taxpayers with the losses.
Much the same thing happened with busted S&Ls, a problem 0 Congress just "solved" *T*-1 with a $166 billion *U* bailout.
We hear that HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is toying with *PRO*-1 going along with some of the Cranston - Mitchell proposals.
That sounds like a formula for *PRO* ensuring that he gets dragged *-1 into the next HUD tar pit.
A group of 27 Senators has written Mr. Kemp *PRO*-2 urging him *PRO*-1 to reject Cranston - Mitchell and focus on programs that *T*-29 empower the poor rather than create vast new government obligations.
But even if he agrees, Mr. Kemp doesn't write the nation's housing law--Congress does *?*.
And the majority of Members cynically view the current discrediting of HUD as mainly a chance *PRO* to shove through their own slate of projects.
Exhibit A is last week's House vote *PRO* to fund 40 pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that *T*-30 is at the heart of the HUD scandal.
None of the grants had been requested *-1 by HUD, judged *-1 competitively or were the subject of a single hearing.
More and more observers now realize that the key to *PRO* ending future HUD scandals lies in *PRO* forcing Congress *PRO*-1 to clean up its own act.
This week, a Baltimore Sun editorial said 0 the Lantos subcommittee on HUD should forget about Sam Pierce's testimony for the moment and call some other witnesses: the various congressional sponsors of the 40 pork - barrel projects.
The Sun concluded that Mr. Pierce is only part of the problem--and a part that *T*-31's gone.
"If HUD is *-1 to be reformed *-2," it concluded 0 *?*, Members of Congress will "have *-4 to start *-5 looking into *RNR*-6, and doing something about *RNR*-6, the practices of their colleagues."
Of course, self - reform is about the last thing 0 this Congress is interested in *T*-1.
Proponents of *PRO* expanding FHA programs say 0 they merely want *PRO*-1 to help home buyers who *T*-32 are frozen *-2 out of high - priced markets.
But the FHA program is hemorrhaging bad loans.
Jack Kemp has submitted a package of reforms, and they are surely headed for the Capitol Hill sausage - grinder.
Like the S&L mess before it, this is a problem 0 Congress should be solving *T*-1, not ignoring *T*-1.
Joe F. Lynch, the 56 - year - old chairman and chief executive officer of First Continental Real Estate Investment Trust, was named *-1 to the new post of vice chairman of this bank holding company.
Every workday at 11 a.m., 40 - year - old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes, hops on a bike 0 he keeps *T*-1 at his Morgan Hill, Calif., office and sets out *PRO* to cover a distance 0 most people would travel *T*-2 only by car.
As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him.
When they return to their desks at 1 p.m. *T*-1, they have pedaled 20 miles.
Such fervor for cycling helped Mr. Sinyard build a creative company at the forefront of its industry.
*PRO*-2 Founded *-1 by bike enthusiasts rather than businessmen, Specialized spotted the appeal of fat - tired bikes that *T*-188 go almost anywhere and began *-2 mass - producing them in 1981.
In the past five years, the company's sales have grown to $80 million *U* from $26 million *U*.
Today, so - called mountain bikes account for two - thirds of the $2 billion *U* spent * annually on all bicycles in the U.S. .
With 65% of its sales coming from mountain bikes, Specialized is widely considered *-1 to be a market leader.
(Accessories, largely for mountain - bike users, account for much of the rest of sales.)
But today, the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever.
One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market 0 Specialized helped *PRO*-2 create *T*-1, *PRO*-3 turning out mountain bikes with such well - known names as Schwinn, Peugeot, Raleigh and Nishiki.
Thus, Mr. Sinyard's company must innovate more than ever *PRO*-1 to stay ahead of them, by *PRO*-1 developing new products specifically for mountain biking.
At the same time, though, it must become more structured *PRO*-1 to better manage its growth.
*PRO* Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as *PRO* riding a unicycle.
It is a problem common to small companies that *T*-189 have grown fast--especially when their success attracts big - time competitors *T*-1.
"The big word around Specialized is passion," says *T*-1 Erik Eidsmo, a former ski - industry executive whom Mr. Sinyard recruited *T*-190 from Citicorp *PRO*-2 to run marketing and sales.
"What I hope *PRO*-1 to bring *T*-2 to this is another word: process.
That's my challenge.
It's Mike's challenge as well."
Mr. Eidsmo is one of several key people from outside the cycling industry who *T*-191 were hired *-1 *PRO*-2 to bring the free - wheeling, fast - growing company under tighter control.
"We had a lot of problems," Mr. Sinyard says *T*-1.
While the company's sales were soaring, "We still had a system that *T*-192 was probably appropriate for $10 million to $20 million *U* in sales."
Adds *T*-1 Mr. Eidsmo, "What *T*-193 felt good that day was done that day."
Since his arrival in May, Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned * while *PRO*-1 working for Citicorp, such as management - by - objective, detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends.
"We're finally getting--and it's been very painful--some understanding of what the company's long - term horizon should begin *-1 to look like *T*-2," Mr. Eidsmo says *T*-3.
"But it's risky," he says *T*-1 of Specialized's attempt *PRO* to adopt a corporate structure.
"You don't want *PRO*-1 to lose the magic" of the company's creative drive.
*PRO*-2 Hoping *PRO*-1 to stay ahead of the pack, the company is emphasizing innovation.
At a recent trade show, convention - goers lined up *PRO*-1 to view a new Specialized bike frame that *T*-194 weighs just 2.7 pounds--a pound less than the lightest mountain - bike frame on the market *?*.
By *PRO*-1 replacing the frame's steel lugs with titanium ones, Mr. Sinyard's company plans *PRO*-1 to make its next generation of frames even lighter.
At the trade show, Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three - spoked bike wheel developed * jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co.
*PRO*-2 Made *-1 of space - age materials, the wheel spokes are designed *-2 like airplane wings *PRO*-4 to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100 - mile race, the company claims 0 *T*-3.
It currently costs $750 *U*, though Mr. Sinyard thinks 0 the price can be reduced *-1 within three years to between $200 and $250 *U*.
He was able *PRO*-1 to slash the price of the company's least expensive mountain bike to $279 *U* from $750 *U* in
But demands on the company's creativity are certain *-1 to grow.
Competition is intensifying as larger companies invade a mountain - bike market 0 Mr. Sinyard's company once had *T*-1 virtually all to itself.
U.S. Cycling Federation official Philip Milburn says 0 mountain biking is "growing at such a monstrous rate that a lot of companies are getting into this."
One especially coveted Specialized market 0 the new players are targeting *T*-1 is mountain - bike accessories, which Mr. Eidsmo calls *T*-2 "*PRO*-3 the future of our business."
Accessories not only sell faster than whole bikes, they also offer profit margins nearly double the 25% to 30% or so *U* on sales of complete cycles.
*PRO*-1 To get a piece of the business, Nike Inc., Beaverton, Ore., introduced a line of mountain - bike shoes.
About a month ago, Michelin Tire Corp., Greenville, S.C., began *-1 selling mountain - bike tires, for years a Specialized stronghold.
Competition in the sale of complete bikes is heating up too.
Trek Bicycle Corp., which *T*-195 accounts for one - quarter of the $400 million *U* in annual sales at its Milwaukee - based parent, Intrepid Corp., entered the mountain - bike business in 1983.
Trek previously made only traditional road bikes, but "it *EXP*-2 didn't take a rocket scientist *PRO* to change a road bike into a mountain bike," says *T*-1 Trek's president, Dick Burke.
The segment now makes up roughly two - thirds of his company's total sales.
At Giant Bicycle Inc., Rancho Dominguez, Calif., sales have tripled since the company entered the U.S. mountain - bike business in 1987.
A subsidiary of a Taiwanese holding company with world - wide sales of $150 million *U*, Giant *T*-1 is one example of the sudden globalization of Mr. Sinyard's once - cozy market niche.
Schwinn Bicycle Co., Chicago, established joint ventures with bike companies in mainland China and Hungary *PRO*-1 to sell bikes.
In the past year, Derby International Corp., Luxembourg, has acquired such major brands as Peugeot, Raleigh and Nishiki.
In response to the internationalization of the business, Mr. Sinyard's company is replacing independent distributors overseas with wholly owned subsidiaries.
The move will cut out the cost of a middleman and give Specialized more control over marketing and sales.
But as Bill Austin, Giant's president, puts it, "With some of the bigger players consolidating their strength, the game has changed.
Japan's steel exports fell 12.2% in September from a year earlier and were down 1.1% from the previous month, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation reported 0 *T*-1.
September was the 10th consecutive month in which steel exports failed *-2 to reach the year - earlier level *T*-1.
A federation official attributed the decline to brisk demand from domestic industries backed * by continuing economic expansion in Japan.
Japanese steel companies are apparently focusing on domestic sales, but the official said 0 it doesn't necessarily mean that local sales contracts are increasing that markedly.
"They are just too busy 0 *T*-2 to meet domestic demand and have little room for overseas shipments," the official said *T*-1.
American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein in the Oct. 21 TV Guide on "What TV News Doesn't Report *T*-1 About Congress--and Should *?*":
By *PRO*-1 concentrating all their resources on the pay raise, Wright and Tower, the networks actually overlooked some major stories that *T*-181 showed the flaws and shortcomings of the institution....
An imaginative producer could easily have created a fast - moving and interesting piece about how Congress really works *T*-1--and why voters in, say, West Virginia got a federally funded university project and building while voters in Arkansas did not *?* *T*-2.
But nobody did such a piece, *PRO* reflecting a contemporary axiom: the more a scandal has *PRO* to do with a congressman's duties as a congressman, the less likely *ICH*-2 it is *?* *PRO*-1 to catch the fancy of a network.
Ethicist Michael Josephson, in one of his institute's recent publications on "Journalism: In the Year 2000":
The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal, sensitive and intimate facts.
Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ("is this something 0 the public ought *PRO*-5 to know *T*-1") will be replaced *-2 by a much broader test ("is this something 0 the public is interested in *PRO*-4 knowing *T*-3").
And, since the public has always been fascinated *-1 by gossip and voyeurism, reporters and editors will strain for creative angles *PRO*-2 to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships, activities of family members, and all matters about mental and physical health.
Similarly, visual images will be more vivid, sensational and, sometimes, gruesome.
One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who *T*-182 will find sufficient evidence of abuse 0 *T*-1 to arouse an already cynical public to control the press.
Paramount Communications Inc. said 0 it sold two Simon & Schuster information services units to Macmillan Inc., a subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corp.
The two units are Prentice Hall Information Services, which *T*-155 publishes tax, financial planning and business law information, among other services, and Prentice Hall Information Network, which *T*-156 electronically delivers tax information.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1, but industry executives said 0 the units were sold *-2 for $40 million *U*.
Arthur H. Rosenfeld, previously president of the Prentice Hall Tax and Professional Services division, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president of the newly formed Macmillan Professional and Business Reference division.
Simon & Schuster retains the Corporation Law looseleaf service, which *T*-157 will become part of its Prentice Hall Law & Business unit.
Deere & Co. said 0 it reached a tentative agreement with the machinists' union at its Horicon, Wis., plant, *PRO* ending a month - old strike by workers *PPA*-1 at the facility.
The maker of farm equipment said 0 the three - year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers at John Deere Horicon Works, Deere's primary facility for *PRO* producing lawn and grounds - care equipment, takes effect immediately and extends through Oct. 1, 1992.
About 1,150 employees are covered *-1 by the new agreement, Deere said 0 *T*-2.
A permanent smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline routes won approval from the House, which *T*-78 separately sent to President Bush a nearly $67 billion *U* fiscal 1990 bill including the first construction funds for the space station.
The smoking prohibition remains attached to a $27.1 billion *U* transportation bill that *T*-79 must still overcome budget obstacles in Congress.
But yesterday's action put to rest any lingering resistance from tobacco interests.
*PRO*-2 Faced *-1 with inevitable defeat, the once dominant industry declined any recorded vote on the ban, which *T*-80 covers all but a fraction of 1% of daily flights in the U.S. .
The sole exceptions are an estimated 30 flights of six hours or more beginning or ending in Hawaii and Alaska.
*PRO*-1 Assuming final enactment this month, the prohibition will take effect 96 days later, or in early February.
On a 394 - 21 roll call, the House adopted the underlying transportation measure.
But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $3.1 billion *U* in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs.
The additional spending pushes the measure more than $2 billion *U* above its prescribed budget ceiling, and the House Appropriations Committee leadership must now seek a waiver in hopes of *PRO*-1 completing action today.
The separate $67 billion *U* bill sent * to the White House had budget difficulties, too, but *PRO*-1 was saved *-2 ultimately by its importance to a broad spectrum of interests in Congress and the administration itself.
No single bill this year includes more discretionary spending for domestic programs and, apart from the space station, the measure incorporates far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market.
The current ceiling on home loans insured * by the Federal Housing Administration is increased *-1 to $124,875 *U* during fiscal 1990.
And in anticipation of increased lending, the cap on FHA loan guarantees would rise to approximately $73.8 billion *U*.
Separately, the bill gives authority *ICH*-1 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development *PRO* to facilitate the refinancing of high - interest loans subsidized * by the government under the so - called Section 235 home - ownership program for lower - income families.
This provision met early and strong resistance from investment bankers worried * about disruptions in their clients' portfolios.
But the promise of at least $15 million *U* in new savings helped *PRO*-1 to forge a partnership between HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and lawmakers wanting *PRO* to protect their projects elsewhere.
The estimated $1.8 billion *U* for the space station would be double last year's level, and total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would grow 16% to nearly $12.4 billion *U*.
A string of costly projects, including the high - speed national aerospace plane and the advanced communications technology satellite, would continue *-1 to be developed *-2 within these limits.
And while *PRO*-1 imposing a statutory cap of $1.6 billion *U* on future spending, the bill would give NASA $30 million *U* for the start - up of the CRAF - Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe.
Separately, the National Science Foundation is promised *-1 a 7.7% increase *PRO* to bring its appropriations to $2.07 billion *U*.
And while *PRO*-1 pursuing these initiatives, Congress and the White House are squeezed *-1 *ICH*-2 too by steady increases--$551 million *U*--in veteran's medical care.
The result is that all sides resort to sleight of hand *PRO* to make room for competing housing and environmental programs, and the commitments now will drive excess spending into fiscal 1991.
Senior members of the House Budget Committee are reduced *-1 in frustration to *PRO* raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills, yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated * with their own summit agreement with the White House this past spring.
"It *EXP*-3's hard *PRO* to get the administration's attention on anything," said *?* Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.), "because the whole agreement was built *-1 on gimmickry."
Among the subsidies continued * in the transportation bill is *T*-1 $30.7 million *U* 0 *PRO* to maintain commercial air service *T*-2 for an estimated 92 communities, often in rural areas.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va .) strongly resisted deeper cuts sought * by the House.
But at a time when the White House wants *PRO*-2 to kill the entire program *T*-1, Republicans have been among its leading champions.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, used his influence *PRO*-1 to preserve more than $132,000 *U* in subsidies for air service to Sante Fe, N.M., and more than $2.1 million *U* would go for service to eight communities in the western Nebraska district of GOP Rep. Virginia Smith on the House Appropriations Committee.
GP Express, an independent airline serving much of Nebraska, estimates that nearly 40% of its revenues come from the subsidies that *T*-1, in some cases, exceed the cost of a ticket.
For example, a passenger can fly from Chardon, Neb., to Denver for as little as $89 to $109 *U*, according to prices quoted * by the company.
But given the few number of users, the cost to the federal government per passenger is estimated *-1 at $193 *U*, according to House and Senate appropriations committees.
The House action yesterday came as the Senate remained mired in difficulties over a $17.25 billion *U* measure covering the budgets for the State, Commerce, and Justice departments in fiscal 1990.
The compromise bill passed the House last week but *PRO*-1 has now provoked jurisdictional fights with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which *T*-81 jealously protects its prerogatives over operations at the State Department.
The same jealousy can breed confusion, however, in the absence of any authorization bill this year.
House and Senate appropriators sought *PRO*-1 to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed *-4 *T*-3 *T*-2.
But on a 53 - 45 roll call this provision was stripped *-1 from the bill last night after Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I .) complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested * in his panel for more than three decades.
DeSoto Inc. said 0 it is dismissing 200 employees as part of a restructuring aimed * at *PRO* producing pretax savings of $10 million *U* annually.
Under the plan, DeSoto said 0 it will sell certain assets and businesses that *T*-50 don't meet strategic and profitability objectives.
The Des Plaines, Ill., chemical coatings concern, which *T*-51 has about 2,000 employees world - wide, said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to sell its domestic rigid container packaging and flexible adhesives businesses, and its Chicago Heights, Ill., resin plant.
The company said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to use the sale proceeds *PRO*-2 to invest in business opportunities more closely identified * with the company's "refocused direction.
John Franco, 47 years old, formerly vice chairman of Capital Holding Corp. and president of its Accumulation Investment Group, was named *-1 *PRO*-198 chief executive officer of this insurance holding company, effective Dec. 1, *PRO*-1 succeeding Robert T. Shaw, who *T*-197 remains chairman.
I.C.H. also named Steven B. Bing, 42, senior vice president since 1986, as president, *PRO*-3 succeeding John W. Gardiner, who *T*-198 will join the HMS Acquisition Corp. division of Hicks, Muse & Co., which *T*-199 has agreed *PRO*-2 to buy most of I.C.H.'s Denver - based subsidiaries.

Dealers attributed most of the day's gains to market - makers moving prices higher, rather than an outbreak of significant buying interest.
Prices were up across the board, with most blue - chip stocks registering solid gains.
Though the market was stronger, dealers said 0 fresh buying interest was sidelined *-1 ahead of a potential market - affecting debate in the House of Commons set * for Tuesday.
It will be Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's first appearance before the opposition Labor Party.

But Asher B. Edelman, who *T*-89 controls about 16% of the San Antonio, Texas, computer - servicing company, insisted that the announcement didn't have anything 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with the ongoing battle for control of Datapoint Corp.
Any sale of Intelogic could have an impact on the battle between Mr. Edelman and New York attorney Martin Ackerman for control of Datapoint.
Intelogic holds 27.5% of Datapoint's common shares outstanding.
Mr. Edelman said 0 the decision "has nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with Marty Ackerman."
Mr. Ackerman contended that it was a direct response to his efforts *PRO* to gain control of Datapoint.
Intelogic was spun *-1 off from Datapoint four years ago, shortly after Mr. Edelman took control of Datapoint.
*PRO*-1 Shaken by tumbling stock prices and pessimistic projections of U.S. economic growth, currency analysts around the world have toned down their assessments of the dollar's near - term performance.
Most of the 10 analysts polled * last week by Dow Jones International News Service in Frankfurt, Tokyo, London and New York expect the U.S. dollar to ease only mildly in November.
Opinion is mixed over its three - month prospects.
Half of those polled * see the currency trending lower over the next three months, while the others forecast a modest rebound after the New Year.
In late afternoon New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8415 West German marks, up from 1.8340 marks late Monday, and at 142.85 yen, up from 141.90 yen late Monday.
A month ago, a similar survey predicted 0 the dollar would be trading at 1.8690 marks and 139.75 yen by the end of October.
Sterling was trading at $1.5805 *U*, down from $1.5820 *U* late Monday.
In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency was trading at about 142.95 yen at midmorning, up from 142.80 yen at the opening and up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.15 yen.
The average of estimates of the 10 economists polled * puts the dollar around 1.8200 marks at the end of November and at 141.33 yen.
By late January, the consensus calls for the dollar to be trading around 1.8200 marks and near 142 yen.
Those with a bullish view see the dollar trading up near 1.9000 marks and 145 yen, while the dollar bears see the U.S. currency trading around 1.7600 marks and 138 yen.
A number of those polled * predict 0 the dollar will slip as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates.
David Owen, an economist at Kleinwort Benson & Co. in London, said 0 he expects further cuts in short - term U.S. rates in an effort *PRO* to encourage a narrowing of the trade gap and to ensure a soft landing in the U.S. economy.
Robert White, a vice president and manager of corporate trade at First Interstate of California, agreed with that view and predicted 0 the U.S. federal funds rate will drop to between 7 3/4% and 8% *U* within 60 days from its current level at 8 13/16%.
Fed funds is the rate 0 banks charge each other *T*-1 on overnight loans; the Fed influences the rate by *PRO*-2 adding or draining reserves from the banking system.
Mr. White also predicted a half - point cut in the U.S. discount rate in the near future.
The discount rate, currently 7%, is the rate 0 the Fed charges member banks *T*-1 for loans, *PRO* using government securities as collateral.
He expects such a cut "because of problems in several sectors of the economy, particularly real estate and automobiles."
*PRO*-1 Bolstering his argument, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that new home sales for September were down 14% from August's revised 3.1% fall.
The drop marked the largest monthly tumble since a 19% slide in January 1982.
In last month's survey, a number of currency analysts predicted 0 the dollar would be pressured *-1 by a narrowing of interest rate differentials between the U.S. and West Germany.
Indeed, in early October the West German central bank raised its discount and Lombard rates by a full percentage point.
Several other European central banks, notably in Britain, followed the West German Bundesbank's lead by *PRO*-1 raising their own key rates.
And a week later, Japan raised its official discount rate by a half point to 3.75%.
The Japanese discount rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial banks.
After a surprisingly sharp widening in the U.S. August merchandise trade deficit--$10.77 billion *U* from a revised $8.24 billion *U* in July and well above expectations--and a startling 190 - point drop in stock prices on Oct. 13, the Federal Reserve relaxed short - term interest rates, *PRO*-1 knocking fed funds from around 9% to 8 3/4%.
But predictions that central banks of the Group of Seven (G - 7) major industrial nations would continue their massive dollar sales went astray, as the market drove the dollar downward on its own, *PRO*-1 reacting to Wall Street's plunge and subsequent price volatility, lower U.S. interest rates and signs of a slowing U.S. economy.
G - 7 consists of the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, Canada, France and Italy.
Tomoshige Kakita, senior deputy manager in the treasury department of Mitsui Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, suggested that uncertainty about U.S. stocks and bonds has made Japanese investors leery of *PRO* holding those securities in the near term, thus *PRO* damping dollar demand.
But, Mr. Kakita added 0 *?*, once U.S. equities regain some stability, players will move back into dollar - denominated investments, especially Treasury bonds, whose value *T*-6 rises when interest rates decline *T*-1.
Mr. Kakita said 0 the key dollar - yen exchange rate is at 135 yen.
"If 135 is broken *-1, some panic will be seen *-2," he predicted *T*-3, *PRO*-4 explaining that Japanese institutions are comfortable with the dollar anywhere between current levels and 135 yen.
Jens - Uwe Fischer, a senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt, said 0 he expects the dollar to recover within the next three months to around 1.88 marks as U.S. economic data, particularly U.S. trade figures, level off.
He contended that the Fed won't ease rates further, but predicted 0 Bundesbank officials will relax key rates in West Germany.
Alfred Zapfel, chief trader at Bank of Boston in Frankfurt, took an opposite stance.
He said 0 he expects U.S. interest rates to decline, *PRO* dragging the dollar down to around 1.80 marks by the end of January after a short - lived dash to 1.87 marks by the end of November.
West German interest rates, he said 0 *?*, will remain unchanged.
"But I'm not one of these great dollar bears 0 you see more of *T*-1 these days," Mr. Zapfel said *T*-2.
"I can't really see it dropping far below 1.80 marks."
Scott Greene, chief foreign exchange dealer with Julius Baer & Co. in New York, fits the description of a "great dollar bear."
He predicted 0 the U.S. unit will skid below 1.80 marks to around 1.78 marks this month and 1.75 marks by the beginning of the new year.
"We're finally seeing the culmination of all the recessionary buildup of the last few months," he said *T*-1, *PRO*-2 noting 0 a continuing downward trend in U.S. interest rates, a shaky stock market and "gloomier economic times ahead" all signal a significantly lower dollar.
In the wake of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's surprise resignation and sterling's subsequent nose - dive, most analysts had little good 0 *PRO* to say *T*-1 about the pound's near - term prospects.
Mr. Owen of Kleinwort Benson suggested that the new chancellor, John Major, will take a tough line in his autumn statement later this month, *PRO*-1 helping *PRO*-2 to underpin the pound.
But, he warned 0 *?*, the currency will remain at risk.

In the period ended * Sept. 30, net income rose 90% to 31.18 billion yen, or 9.34 yen a share, from 16.38 billion yen, or 5.05 yen a share.
A year ago, the Tokyo company had pretax profit of 35.38 billion yen.
Sales amounted to 1.011 trillion yen, *PRO*-1 climbing 29% from 787.02 billion yen.
*PRO*-2 Encouraged *-1 by the brisk performance, Mitsubishi plans *PRO*-2 to raise its per - share dividend to 3.50 yen from three yen.
Company officials said 0 the current robust domestic demand that *T*-106 has been fueling sustained economic expansion helped push up sales of products like ships, steel structures, power systems and machinery and resulted in sharply higher profit.
The Treasury plans *PRO*-1 to raise $2.3 billion *U* in new cash with the sale Monday of about $16 billion *U* in short - term bills *PRO* to redeem $13.71 billion *U* in maturing bills.
However, the Treasury said 0 it will postpone the auction unless it has assurances of enactment of legislation 0 *T*-1 to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auction date.
The offering will be divided *-1 evenly between 13 - week and 26 - week bills maturing on Feb. 8, 1990, and May 10, 1990, respectively.
Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 *U* denominations, must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Carl E. Pfeiffer, chief executive officer, was named *-1 to the additional post of chairman of this specialty - metals manufacturing concern.
Robert C. Snyder, a director and chief operating officer of the company, succeeds Mr. Pfeiffer as president.
Battle - tested Japanese industrial managers here always buck up nervous newcomers with the tale of the first of their countrymen 0 *T*-1 to visit Mexico, a boatload of samurai warriors blown * ashore 375 years ago.
"From the beginning, it *EXP*-1 took a man with extraordinary qualities *PRO* to succeed in Mexico," says *T*-2 Kimihide Takimura, president of Mitsui group's Kensetsu Engineering Inc. unit.
Here in this new center for Japanese assembly plants just across the border from San Diego, turnover is dizzying, infrastructure shoddy, bureaucracy intense.
Even after - hours drag; "karaoke" bars, where Japanese revelers sing over recorded music *T*-1, are prohibited *-2 by Mexico's powerful musicians union.
Still, 20 Japanese companies, including giants such as Sanyo Industries Corp., Matsushita Electronics Components Corp. and Sony Corp. have set up shop in the state of Northern Baja California.
*PRO* Keeping the Japanese *PRO*-2 happy will be one of the most important tasks facing conservative leader Ernesto Ruffo when he takes office Nov. 1, as the first opposition governor in Mexico's modern history *T*-1.
Mexico, with its desperate need for investment, and Japan, with its huge budget surplus, would seem like a perfect match.
But the two countries remain separated by a cultural barrier wider than the ocean.
Conservative Japanese investors are put off *-1 by what they consider *T*-2 Mexico's restrictive investment regulations and loose work habits.
From the Mexicans' viewpoint, vaunted tactics of methodical Japanese managers don't count for much in a land where a saying says "there are no fixed rules ." *T*-1
Japan ranks as only the fourth largest foreign investor in Mexico, with 5% of the total investments.
That is just 1% of all the money 0 Japan has invested *T*-1 abroad.
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would like *PRO*-1 to change that.
The young president so admires Japanese discipline that he sends his children to a Japanese school in Mexico City.
He already has finagled a $2 billion *U* loan *PPA*-1 from the Japanese government.
But Mexico urgently needs more help.
Mr. Salinas's unpopular Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, faces congressional elections in 1991.
For the PRI to stand a chance, Mr. Salinas has *-2 to press on with an economic program that so far *T*-1 has succeeded in *PRO*-3 lowering inflation and providing moderate economic growth.
But *PRO* maintaining the key components of his strategy--a stable exchange rate and high level of imports--will consume enormous amounts of foreign exchange.
Mr. Salinas needs big investment inflows--quickly.
The problem is that Japanese businesses make decisions with a view well beyond the coming months that *T*-2 weigh so heavily on Mr. Salinas.
"The Japanese will come to Mexico, but not immediately," says *T*-1 Kazushige Suzuki, director - general of the Japanese External Trade Organization in Mexico.
If not now, when?
"When the fruit is ripe *T*-2, it falls from the tree by itself," he says *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Pressed *-2 on the matter, he is more specific.
"There will be big Japanese investments probably five to 10 years from now."
Ryukichi Imai, Japan's ambassador to Mexico, agrees that Mexico may be too eager.
"There seems *-1 to be a presumption *ICH*-2 in some sectors of (Mexico's) government that there is a lot of Japanese money waiting behind the gate, and that by *PRO* slightly opening the gate, that money will enter Mexico.
I don't think 0 that is the case."
Mexican officials maintain 0 the Japanese reserve is only a result of unfamiliarity.
"Because of distance, it *EXP*-2 takes a while for them to appreciate the economic stability 0 we've achieved *T*-1," says *T*-3 one economic policymaker.
Mexico is sending a number of missions to Japan *PRO*-1 looking for a major breakthrough investment in telecommunications, petrochemicals or tourism.
It is hoped that other Japanese would then follow the leader.
But Japanese investors say that their reluctance *PRO* to invest stems not only from concerns about Mexico's economic outlook, but also reservations about Mexico's recently revamped investment law.
*PRO*-1 Unable *PRO*-2 to get a new law through a congress with a strong leftist bloc, Mexico jury - rigged the existing law's regulations.
It created special 20 - year trusts *PRO*-1 to allow foreigners 100% ownership in some once - closed industries.
It also made artful use of semantics, *PRO*-1 redefining as non-strategic industries some that *T*-3 had been in the national domain.
"Those devices don't give sufficient certainty to our bosses in Japan," says *T*-1 Yasuo Nakamura, representative of the Industrial Bank of Japan.
Mr. Nakamura cites the case of a customer who *T*-4 wants *PRO*-1 to build a giant tourism complex in Baja and *T*-4 has been trying for eight years *PRO*-2 to get around Mexican restrictions on foreign ownership of beachfront property.
He could develop the beach through a trust, but instead is trying *PRO*-1 have his grandson become a naturalized Mexican so his family gains direct control.
Some say 0 the best hope for the Mexicans is *PRO* catching the eye of Japan by *PRO*-2 promoting the one industry 0 the Japanese clearly like *T*-1--the border assembly plants, known * as "maquiladoras," which *T*-5 are open to 100% foreign control.
"We must do more *PRO* to help the Japanese here in Baja if we want them to invest elsewhere," says *T*-1 Mr. Ruffo, the governor - elect of the National Action Party and himself a succesful businessman.
Plant operators are heartened *-1 by Mr. Ruffo's pledge *PRO* to cut corruption associated * with the ruling party officials.
But Mr. Ruffo frets that an even bigger problem could be protectionism from the U.S., where some politicians oppose what they consider *T*-2 Japanese efforts *PRO* to use maquiladoras *PRO*-3 to crack the U.S. market through the back door *T*-1.
The city's Department of Consumer Affairs charged Newmark & Lewis Inc. with *PRO* failing *-1 to deliver on its promise of *PRO* lowering prices.
In a civil suit commenced in state Supreme Court in New York, the agency alleged that the consumer - electronics and appliance discount - retailing chain engaged in deceptive advertising by *PRO*-2 claiming *PRO*-1 to have "lowered every price on every item" as part of an advertising campaign that *T*-165 began June 1.
The agency said 0 it monitored Newmark & Lewis's advertised prices before and after the ad campaign, and found that the prices of at least 50 different items either increased or stayed the same.
In late May, Newmark & Lewis announced a plan *PRO* to cut prices 5% to 20% and eliminate what it called *T*-166 *PRO*-167 a "standard discount - retailing practice" of *PRO* negotiating individual deals with customers.
The consumer agency also disputed Newmark & Lewis's continuing strategy of *PRO* advertising "new lower prices" when allgedly there haven't been price reductions since June 1 *T*-1.
Richard D. Lewis, president of the 47 - store chain, defended the company's pricing campaign, *PRO*-1 saying 0 it didn't use "the misleading expression ` reduced from original prices."'
Mr. Lewis said 0 the company marked price tags and advertised at its "lowest possible prices" for all its merchandise *PRO*-1 to reduce public confusion.
Mr. Lewis said 0 the company gave the Consumer Affairs department "volumes of documents" *PRO*-1 to substantiate its statements, and made "every effort *PRO* to comply" with all the agency's policies.
In its suit, the consumer agency seeks fines of $1,000 *U* per violation of the city's Consumer Protection Law, costs of investigation, and an injunction 0 *T*-1 to prevent Newmark & Lewis from *PRO*-2 continuing its allegedly deceptive advertising.
A governing body of both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board voted *PRO*-1 to give the FASB jurisdiction over accounting standards for certain government - owned entities.
The Financial Accounting Foundation voted 12 - 2 that FASB accounting rules supercede GASB rules in regard to utilities, hospitals, and colleges and universities owned * by the government.
GASB rules still apply for other government units.
After the GASB was founded *-1 in 1984, 11 years after the FASB, the government - owned entities were supposed *-2 to follow FASB rules unless the GASB superceded them.
The GASB had told governments 0 they didn't have *-1 to follow FASB rules on depreciation, *PRO* making it *EXP*-2 difficult for bond - rating agencies to compare private and state - owned schools, which *T*-158 compete in the public bond market.
The foundation vote is effective for the affected government entities with fiscal years that *T*-159 begin *PRO* starting next Jan. 1 and makes the financial results of the hospitals, colleges and schools easier *PRO* to compare with for - profit businesses.
But it may lead to separate financial reports based * on different rules for the government entities under FASB rules and those still under GASB rules.
"Managers of government entities are often more concerned with the political and legal structure and financial - report comparability with profit - making businesses isn't always as high a priority," a foundation spokesman said *T*-1.
General Dynamics Corp. was given *-1 an $843 million *U* Air Force contract for F - 16 aircraft and related equipment.
Loral Corp.'s defense systems division received a $54.9 million *U* Air Force contract for a F - 15 weapons system trainer.
Southern Air Transport Inc. won $47.5 million *U* in Air Force and Navy contracts for transportation services.
International Business Machines Corp. was given *-1 a $31.2 million *U* Air Force contract for satellite data systems equipment.
Directed Technologies received a $28.3 million *U* Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contract for advanced propulsion systems research.
Propper International Inc. got a $22.8 million *U* Defense Logistics Agency contract for combat camouflage trousers.
Earlier this year, President Bush made a final "*PRO* take - it - or - leave it" offer on the minimum wage: an increase to $4.25 *U* an hour over three years, and only if *PRO* accompanied *-1 by a lower wage for the first six months of a job.
Now, the White House has decided *PRO*-1 to accept the higher wage over only two years.
The sub-minimum wage would apply only to first - time teen - age workers for 90 days.
The White House had enough votes *PRO* to sustain a veto but chose *PRO*-1 to avoid a confrontation.
The only permanent losers will be the 200,000 or so workers 0 everyone agrees 0 *T*-2 will be priced *-1 out of a job at the $4.25 *U* rate 0 Congress is likely *PRO*-4 to approve *T*-3 today.
It is compromises such as this that *T*-8 convince Washington's liberals that if they simply stay the course, this administration will stray from its own course on this and other issues.
When Thomas W. Wathen went big league last year *T*-1, he acquired a treasure - trove of Americana along with a well - known but ailing security business: Pinkerton's Inc.
There was a wanted poster offering "Rewards for the Arrest of Express and Train Robbers Frank James and Jesse W. James" and the original Pinkerton's logo with an open eye and the inscription "We Never Sleep," which *T*-12 inspired the phrase "private eye."
Then there were two gold watches once owned * by Allan Pinkerton, who *T*-13 founded the company in Chicago in 1850.
But there were supposed *-1 to be three, Mr. Wathen's company claims 0 *T*-2.
The missing watch is emblematic of the problems 0 Mr. Wathen encountered *T*-1 in *PRO* building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions.
The ever - optimistic Mr. Wathen has learned that while *PRO* acquiring a big brand - name company can be a shortcut to growth, it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems.
"We cleared out a lot of rats' nests," says *T*-1 the 60 - year - old security veteran.
Mr. Wathen, who *T*-14 started his career as an Air Force investigator and worked as a security officer for several large companies, built his California Plant Protection from a tiny mom - and - pop security patrol firm here in the San Fernando Valley.
He joined the firm in 1963 and *PRO* bought it from the owners the next year.
Over the next 20 years, California Plant Protection opened 125 offices around the country.
Yet although California Plant Protection was netting bigger and bigger clients--the firm provided security for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles--it still didn't have the name recognition of Pinkerton's.
So when American Brands Inc. decided *PRO*-1 to sell the unit in 1987 as part of a divestiture of its food and security industries operations *T*-3, Mr. Wathen saw a chance *PRO* to accomplish several objectives.
He decided 0 he could easily merge Pinkerton's operations with his own while *PRO*-1 slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities.
He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton's employees, many of whom *T*-15 had spent their entire careers with the firm, he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition 0 he'd wanted *T*-1.
Mr. Wathen also relished the chance *PRO* to demonstrate 0 an entrepreneur like himself, who *T*-16'd spent his whole career in the security business, could run Pinkerton's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker.
"The security business is my favorite subject.
I love this business," he says *T*-1.
"Most of the LBO guys don't know how *PRO* to run a business anyway *T*-1."
But there were hitches, not the least of which *T*-17 was that, Mr. Wathen says, he proceeded almost blindly in *PRO* doing the $95 million *U* acquisition, which *T*-18 was completed *-1 in January 1988.
"We weren't allowed *PRO*-1 to do any due diligence because of competitive reasons.
If we had *?*, it might have scared us off," he says *T*-1.
Five years of rapid expansion under American Brands, with an emphasis on *PRO* marketing the agency's services instead of improving them, had hurt Pinkerton's profits, Mr. Wathen claims 0 *T*-1.
He says 0 his team couldn't tell whether accounts receivable had been paid *-1 or not.
Pinkerton's had locked itself into low - price contracts *PRO*-1 to win new business, with no hope of profitability until the contracts expired *-3, he adds 0 *T*-2.
And regional offices were "egregiously overstaffed," he claims 0 *T*-1.
One office had 19 people doing the work of three, "and half of the employees had company automobiles."
American Brands declined *PRO*-1 to comment on Mr. Wathen's accusations.
The acquisition combined the country's second - largest security company, Pinkerton's, with 1987 sales of $410 million *U*, and the fourth largest, California Plant Protection, with $250 million *U* in sales, *PRO*-1 creating the industry's biggest firm, which *T*-19 took on the Pinkerton's name.
Even after *PRO*-1 divesting itself of $120 million *U* of unprofitable business, the new Pinkerton's will have sales of about $610 million *U* this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2% - 3% *U* of sales, says 0 *T*-3 Lloyd Greif of Sutro & Co. in Los Angeles, which *T*-20 arranged the Pinkerton's acquisition.
Mr. Wathen says 0 his turnaround strategy *ICH*-1 has been simple: *PRO* just hack away at the fat.
He began by *PRO*-1 closing 120 of the combined companies' 260 offices in two months, *PRO* eliminating about 31% of the company's 2,500 - person adminstrative staff, including more than 100 sales positions.
He shut down the company's tony New York headquarters.
Pinkerton's world headquarters today is a nondescript, two - story office building across the street from the small Van Nuys Airport.
Next, Mr. Wathen raised Pinkerton's rates, which *T*-21 were 75 - cents - an - hour lower than California Plant Protection's average rate of around $8.63 *U*.
And he got rid of low - margin businesses that *T*-22 just weren't making money for the company.
Mr. Wathen, who *T*-23 says 0 Pinkerton's had a loss of nearly $8 million *U* in 1987 under American Brands, boasts that he's made Pinkerton's profitable again.
But Mr. Wathen's team still must pay down about $82 million *U* of long - term bank debt from the acquisition within the next four years.
Last year, earnings of the combined companies didn't cover debt service and Pinkerton's was forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to borrow $20 million *U* of subordinated debt.
"We wouldn't have had *-1 to refinance if a lot of the problems hadn't been there," Mr. Wathen says *T*-2.
This year, Mr. Wathen says 0 the firm will be able *PRO*-1 to service debt and still turn a modest profit.
Now Pinkerton's could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent.
The company recently filed suit in state court in Los Angeles against American Brands, *PRO*-2 seeking at least $40 million *U* in damages from the Old Greenwich, Conn. - based company.
The suit alleges that American Brands misrepresented the financial condition of Pinkerton's before the sale, failed *-1 to disclose pending lawsuits and material contracts in which Pinkerton's was in default *T*-3, hadn't registered the Pinkerton's name and trademark in the United Kingdom and didn't tell California Plant Protection about some labor controversies.
"We have previously had discussions with representatives of Pinkerton's Inc. concerning the {sale of the company} and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract," says *T*-1 American Brands.
"As this is now a litigation matter, we have no further comment."
And then there's the case of the missing gold watch.
The lawsuit alleges that an inventory of Pinkerton's memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches hadn't been forked *-1 over by American Brands.
"American Brand's failure *PRO* to surrender the gold watch has damaged new Pinkerton's in an amount as yet 0 {*T*-3 to be} determined *-4 and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained *T*-2," the suit charges *T*-5.
The key to Pinkerton's future will be *PRO* sticking to what it does *T*-1 best--*PRO* being a security company, says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Wathen.
The company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations, particularly undercover investigations for corporations.
Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more "glamorous" of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value.
(Author Dashiell Hammett, who *T*-24 wrote "The Maltese Falcon," was a former Pinkerton's detective.)
American Brands "just had a different approach," Mr. Wathen says 0 *T*-1.
"Their approach didn't work; mine is *?*.
Wary investors have been running for the stock market's equivalent of bomb shelters, *PRO*-1 buying shares of gold - mining and utility companies.
Those two groups have recently been leading the list of stocks setting new highs.
On Friday, when only a dozen common stocks hit 52 - week highs on the New York Stock Exchange *T*-1, five were gold - mining issues, and another four were utilities.
On Monday, when a mere seven common stocks managed new highs *T*-1, six were utilities or golds.
At first glance, gold and utilities seem *-1 strange bedfellows.
After all, gold prices usually soar when inflation is high *T*-1.
Utility stocks, on the other hand, thrive on disinflation, because the fat dividends 0 utilities pay *T*-1 look more attractive when prices are falling (or rising slowly) *T*-2.
But the two groups have something very important in common: They are both havens for scared money, stocks for people who *T*-167 hate stocks.
It's as if investors, the past few days, are betting that something is going *-1 to go wrong--even if they don't know what.
If the stock market and the economy catch their breath and show that they're on firmer footing, these stocks might well fall back.
Indeed, that happened to some extent yesterday, as industrial stocks rebounded, partly on news of takeovers in the paper industry.
Still, a lot of investors clearly have revived their interest in gold and utility shares.
"The primary overriding thing is that people are frightened," says *T*-1 Martin Sass, a New York money manager.
"The aftershocks of Oct. 13 (when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 190 points *T*-1) are still reverberating."
Certainly, the Oct. 13 sell - off didn't settle any stomachs.
Beyond that, money managers and analysts see other problems.
Inventories are creeping up; car inventories are already high, and big auto makers are idling plants.
Takeover fever has cooled, *PRO* removing a major horse from the market's cart.
Britain's unsettled political scene also worries some investors.
"The gyrations in the British government" add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market, says 0 *T*-1 John Hoffman, assistant director of research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
"One of the three major markets in the world is getting chewed *-1 up pretty bad."
"If the Fed does not come to the rescue and produce lower short - term interest rates over the next 30 days, the market's going *-1 to flounder," says Larry Wachtel, a market analyst with Prudential - Bache Securities.
With this sort of sentiment common, it *EXP*-1's natural for investors to seek out "defensive" investments.
Utilities are a classic example: Even in recessions, people continue *-1 to use electric power, water and gas at a fairly steady rate.
Such defensive issues as food, tobacco, and drug stocks have been in favor for some time.
But many of these stocks have now become expensive.
Mr. Wachtel points to Coca - Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples: They're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per - share earnings.
Gold stocks aren't cheap on this basis, either, with many selling for 20 times earnings or more.
Even utility stocks aren't all that inexpensive, at an average of 14 times earnings.
But the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness.
If gold stocks and utilities continue *-1 to lead, it may signal that the market is in for rough times.
That's just what Joseph Granville expects *T*-168.
"We are going *-1 to explode lower," says *T*-2 the flamboyant market seer, who *T*-169 had a huge following a few years back.
"Anyone telling you *PRO*-1 to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible.
You don't want *PRO*-1 to own anything *ICH*-2 long except gold stocks."
One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally 0 he keeps *T*-1 of stocks within a point of *PRO* hitting new highs or lows.
Last Friday, 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12 - month lows.
But by Mr. Granville's count, 493 issues were within one point of such lows.
Robert Stovall, a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall / Twenty - First Securities, has money in both gold and utility issues.
"I think 0 we could very well have {an economic} slowdown, beginning very soon if not already," he says *T*-1.
Mr. Stovall doesn't expect an actual recession.
But he does expect "a muffler dragger" of an economy, with "very slow growth, maybe one quarter of no growth at all."
In such a climate, utility stocks look good to him.
He favors FPL Group Inc., Florida Progress Corp., TECO Energy Inc., Wisconsin Energy Corp., and Dominion Resources Inc.
The appeal of gold issues, Mr. Stovall says 0 *?*, is that "they're a counter group.
You go into them because they move counter to the general market."
He adds that gold stocks had been down so long 0 they were "ready for a bounce."
His favorites are American Barrick Resources Corp., Echo Bay Mines Ltd. and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp.
Nevertheless, Mr. Stovall emphasizes that "you don't buy {gold stocks} based on powerful fundamentals."
In addition to *PRO*-1 having high price - earnings ratios, most pay puny dividends, if any.
"The earning power {of gold mining companies} is restricted unless the gold price hops up over $425 *U* an ounce," he says *T*-1.
Abby Cohen, an investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, also thinks 0 it *EXP*-1 makes sense *PRO* to have some money in both utilities and gold.
"My outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits" in 1990, she says *T*-1.
But "a bunch of utilities" should post profit increases.
Among utilities, Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp.
As for gold, she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak *T*-1, as it has been *?* lately.
Among gold stocks, Drexel likes Battle Mountain Gold Co., Newmont Gold Co. and Freeport - McMoRan Gold Co.
Marks & Spencer PLC reported a 12% gain in first - half pretax profit, mainly because of improving performances in the U.K. and continental Europe.
In the six months ended Sept. 30, pretax profit at the British clothing and food retailer rose to #208.7 million *U* ($330.1 million *U*) from #185.5 million *U* a year ago.
The results surpassed analysts' forecasts, which *T*-90 averaged around #200 million *U*, and Marks & Spencer responded in trading on London's Stock Exchange with an eight pence rise to 188 pence.
Profit after tax and minority interest but before extraordinary items rose 12% to #135.2 million *U*; per - share earnings rose to five pence from 4.5 pence.
Marks declared an interim per - share dividend of 1.85 pence, compared with 1.7 pence a year earlier.
Sales increased 11% to #2.5 billion *U* from #2.25 billion *U*, while operating profit climbed 13% to #225.7 million *U* from #199.8 million *U*.
Sales in North America and the Far East were inflated *-1 by acquisitions, *PRO*-1 rising 62% to #278 million *U*.
Operating profit dropped 35%, however, to #3.8 million *U*.
Brooks Brothers, which Marks bought *T*-1 last year, saw operating profit drop in half to #5 million *U*.
Farm prices in October edged up 0.7% from September as raw milk prices continued their rise, the Agriculture Department said 0 *T*-1.
Milk sold * to the nation's dairy plants and dealers averaged $14.50 *U* for each hundred pounds, up 50 cents from September and up $1.50 *U* from October 1988, the department said 0 *T*-2.
Commercial vegetables, led * by lettuce and tomatoes, rose 19% in October; oranges and other fruits rose 5%.
Broiler prices fell 6.5 cents in October to 30.6 cents a pound, while turkey prices rose 1.2 cents a pound to 38.5 cents.
Egg prices averaged 64.2 cents a dozen, down 0.2 cent from September.
Hogs rose $3.40 *U* to $46.80 *U* a hundredweight in October, while beef cattle slipped 80 cents to $67.40 *U* for each hundred pounds and calves dropped 90 cents to $90.20 *U*.
Soybeans averaged $5.28 *U* a bushel, down 42 cents from September; corn averaged $2.20 *U*, down seven cents, and sorghum grain averaged $3.61 *U* for each hundred pounds, down 19 cents, according to the department.
Bouygues S.A., a diversified construction concern based * in Paris, said 0 its consolidated profit for the 1989 first half, after payments to minority interests, surged to 188 million French francs ($30.2 million *U*) from 65 million francs a year earlier.
Revenue rose 21% to 22.61 billion francs from 18.69 billion francs.
The company didn't specify reasons for the strong earnings gain.
But Bouygues said 0 its first - half profit isn't indicative of the full - year trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the company's activities.
For all of 1988, Bouygues had consolidated profit of 519 million francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of 50 billion francs.
The group has forecast 1989 revenue of 56.9 billion francs.
Philip Morris Cos. is launching a massive corporate advertising campaign that *T*-58 will put the tobacco giant's name in TV commercials for the first time since the early 1950s, when it stopped *-2 advertising its namesake cigarette brand on television *T*-1.
The campaign, a patriotic celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, doesn't mention cigarettes or smoking; cigarette ads have been prohibited *-1 on television since 1971.
But even before it begins, the campaign is drawing fire from anti-smoking advocates, who *T*-59 criticize Philip Morris's attempt *PRO* to bolster its beleaguered image by *PRO* wrapping itself in the document that *T*-60 is a cornerstone of American democracy.
Philip Morris, which *T*-61 became the U.S.'s largest food company last year with its $12.9 billion *U* acquisition of Kraft Inc., seems *-1 determined *PRO*-2 to evolve beyond its roots in Marlboro country.
The company's research suggests that its name recognition among most consumers remains unusually low, although its array of brands--including Maxwell House coffee, Jell - O, Cheez Whiz, and Miller beer--blanket supermarket shelves.
The company is expected *-1 to spend about $30 million *U* a year on its two - year corporate campaign, created * by WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather unit in New York.
The initial spots will appear during morning and prime - time news shows.
Philip Morris hopes that by *PRO* taking its Bill of Rights theme to the airwaves, in addition to publications, it will reach the broadest possible audience.
Until now, its corporate ads, mainly promoting its sponsorship of the arts, have appeared almost exclusively in newspapers and magazines.
"Most people--whether in Toledo, Tucson or Topeka--haven't got a clue who we are *T*-62," says *T*-1 Guy L. Smith, Philip Morris's vice president of corporate affairs.
"If they think well of the company through our support of the Bill of Rights, it *EXP*-1 follows 0 they'll think well of our products."
Mr. Smith says 0 the Bill of Rights commercial, which *T*-63 trumpets the themes of liberty and freedom of expression, isn't designed *PRO*-1 to have any special appeal for smokers.
Although Philip Morris typically tries *PRO*-1 to defend the rights of smokers with free - choice arguments, "this has nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-3 with cigarettes, nor will it ever *?*," the spokesman says 0 *T*-2.
But some anti-smoking activists disagree, *PRO*-1 expressing anger at what they see *T*-64 as the company's attempt *PRO* to purchase innocence by association.
"I'm outraged because this company is portraying itself at the heart of American culture and political freedom and in fact it's a killer," says *T*-1 Michael Pertschuk, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and a tobacco - industry critic.
"It should be treated *-1 like the Medellin {drug} mafia, not the Founding Fathers."
Mr. Pertschuk adds that the new commercial dovetails perfectly with major aspects of Philip Morris's political strategy.
These include *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to protect its print advertising by *PRO*-1 invoking the First Amendment, and wooing blacks by *PRO*-1 portraying itself as a protector of civil rights.
(The commercial features, among others, the voice of Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader.)
Many marketers say 0 Philip Morris's approach will be effective, but they agree that the ads' implied smoking message is unmistakable.
"This is clever, subliminal advertising that really *T*-65 says, ` Smokers have rights, too,"' says *T*-1 Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., marketing strategy firm.
"This is designed *PRO*-1 to get the wagons in a circle and defend the smoking franchise."
Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, adds: "It *EXP*-1's very popular *PRO* to drape yourself in the flag these days.
If you can do that and at the same time *PRO*-1 send a message that *T*-66 supports your business, that's brilliant."
RJR Nabisco Inc. and American Brands Inc. say 0 they have no plans *PRO* to follow Philip Morris's lead.
(Indeed, RJR Nabisco is currently under fire for *PRO*-1 having sent 80 - second videotapes touting its Now brand to consumers who *T*-67 smoke American Brands' Carltons.)
Despite the criticism, Philip Morris's corporate campaign runs little risk of *PRO* getting yanked *-1 off the tube.
"They aren't showing James Madison taking a puff or lighting up," says *T*-1 Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University.
"All 0 they are trying *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 is borrow some of the legitimacy of the Bill of Rights itself.
NEC Corp. said 0 it plans *PRO* to more than double its British subsidiary's capacity for the production of semiconductor wafers.
Officials at the Japanese semiconductor maker said 0 the company intends *PRO*-1 to increase investment in plant and equipment by 10 billion yen ($70.6 million *U*), to 90 billion yen, in the year ending March 31, with the extra funds used * *PRO* to increase production overseas.
Officials said 0 they weren't sure how the money will be distributed *-1 among overseas units *T*-2, but added that NEC Semiconductors U.K. Ltd. will receive priority.
Officials also disclosed 0 it *EXP*-1's possible that NEC may reduce domestic production of one - megabit chips to five million a month from six million, *PRO* beginning January, because of deteriorating market prices.
After 20 years of *PRO* pushing labor proposals 0 *T*-1 to overhaul the nation's health - care system, Bert Seidman of the AFL - CIO is finding interest from an unlikely quarter: big business.
Corporate leaders, frustrated * by double - digit increases in health - care costs, are beginning *-1 to sound like liberal Democrats.
Failure *PRO* to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today *T*-1 are free - market advocates *PRO*-4 to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government - sponsored national health insurance," Arthur Puccini, a General Electric Co. vice president, warned 0 *T*-3 earlier this year.
The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus.
Both the AFL - CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures 0 *T*-1 to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently *T*-35 lack health insurance.
Agreement on these points is a long way from a specific program, and nobody expects the U.S. to rush toward radical restructuring of the health - care system.
But there are signs that labor - management cooperation could change the politics of health - care legislation and the economics of medicine.
"I can't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is *T*-1 *T*-3," says *T*-2 Mr. Seidman, who *T*-36 heads the AFL - CIO's department dealing with health matters.
Because the Bush administration isn't taking the initiative on health issues, business executives are dealing with congressional Democrats who *T*-37 champion health - care revision.
"Business across the country is spending more time *PRO*-2 addressing this issue," says *T*-1 Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass .).
"It's a bottom - line issue."
Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that *T*-38 would require employers *PRO*-39 to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but doesn't contain cost - control measures *T*-1.
Partly in response, a bipartisan group of senators from the finance and labor committees is drafting a plan 0 *T*-1 to attract broader support.
It will feature a cost - containment provision designed * *PRO* to keep expanded benefits from *PRO*-1 fueling higher care prices.
*PRO*-1 At 11.1% of gross national product, U.S. health costs already are the highest in the world.
By contrast, Japan's equal 6.7% of GNP, a nation's total output of goods and services.
Management and labor worry that the gap makes U.S. companies less competitive.
Chrysler Corp. estimates that health costs add $700 *U* *ICH*-1 to the price of each of its cars, about $300 to $500 *U* more per car than foreign competitors pay for health.
"The cost of health care is eroding standards of living and sapping industrial strength," complains *T*-1 Walter Maher, a Chrysler health - and - benefits specialist.
Labor is upset because many companies are using higher employee insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments *PRO* to deflect surging medical costs to workers.
Health benefits are contentious issues in the strikes against Pittston Co. and Nynex Corp.
In their new contract this year, American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the Communications Workers of America agreed *PRO*-1 to look for "prompt and lasting national solutions" to rising health - care costs.
Some analysts are cynical about the new corporate interest in health - care overhaul.
Carl Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, scoffs at "capitalists who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to socialize the entire financing system" for health.
"They hope 0 they can buy some government cost discipline," but this is a false hope, Mr. Schramm says 0 *T*-1.
He asserts that government has done an even worse job of *PRO* controlling its health bill than business *?*.
So far neither the Bush administration nor Congress is prepared *PRO*-1 to lead the way toward *PRO* revamping health care.
The administration lacks a comprehensive health - care policy.
Congress still is struggling *PRO*-1 to dismantle the unpopular Catastrophic Care Act of 1988, which *T*-39 boosted benefits for the elderly and *PRO*-2 taxed them *PRO*-3 to pay for the new coverage.
A bipartisan commission established * by Congress and headed * by Sen. John Rockefeller (D., W.Va .) is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to present new plans for *PRO* dealing with the uninsured and long - term care for the elderly by next March 1.
A quadrennial commission appointed * by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is taking a broad look at the economics of Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor and the health system in general.
It is expected *-1 to report next summer.
"No magic bullet will be discovered *-1 next year, an election year," says *T*-2 Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.)
But 1991 could be a window for action.
The pressure for change will rise with costs.
"I think 0 employers are really going *-1 to be the ones 0 *T*-2 to push for major change," says *T*-3 Sharon Canner, a health expert at NAM.
Any major attempt *PRO* to revamp the health - care system is likely *-1 to trigger opposition from politically powerful interest groups, particularly the American Medical Association, and perhaps from the public as well, if Congress takes steps that patients fear 0 *T*-2 will limit the availability of care.
The NAM embraces efforts *ICH*-2, which both the administration and the medical profession have begun *T*-1, *PRO* to measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and then *PRO* to draft medical - practice guidelines.
Advocates hope that such standards will improve treatment while *PRO*-1 limiting unnecessary tests and medical procedures.
HHS Secretary Sullivan estimates that as much as 25% of the medical procedures performed * each year may be inappropriate or unnecessary.
*PRO* Limiting care won't be easy or popular.
"*PRO* To slow the rise in total spending, it *ICH*-1 will be necessary *PRO* to reduce per - capita use of services," the NAM warns *T*-2 in a policy statement.
This will "require us *PRO*-41 to define--and redefine--what *T*-40 is ` necessary' or ` appropriate' care.
This involves trade - offs and {it} cuts against the grain of existing consumer and even provider conceptions of what *T*-1 is ` necessary."'
The AFL - CIO also embraces treatment guidelines.
In addition, it's toying with an approach that *T*-41 would impose health - expenditure ceilings or budgets on the government as a whole and on individual states as a way 0 *PRO* to slow health - care spending *T*-1.
At a meeting here on Nov. 15, the labor federation plans *PRO*-1 to launch a major effort *PRO* to build grass - roots support for health - care overhaul.
Gillette Co., Boston, said 0 it is planning *PRO*-1 to restructure its South African subsidiary.
Under the plan, Gillette South Africa will sell manufacturing facilities in Springs, South Africa, and its business in toiletries and plastic bags to Twins Pharmaceuticals Ltd., an affiliate of Anglo American Corp., a South African company.
Terms were not disclosed *-1.
A final agreement has not been signed *-1, and the moves will not have a material effect on the company, Gillette said 0 *T*-2.
The company said 0 it is part of a continuing world - wide restructuring in which it has downsized or sold operations in several countries *T*-1.
Gillette said 0 its continued presence in South Africa "enables it *PRO*-2 to make meaningful contributions to South African society, to the lives of its employees and to the communities in which it operates *T*-1."
Gillette South Africa employs about 250 people.
About 60% of the work force will continue with Gillette or transfer to Twins Pharmaceuticals, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Trial and Terror
At times I sequester my mind When I must think with precision *T*-4, *PRO*-3 Detached from all other thoughts While *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-1 to reach a decision.

Bonnie J. Stedt was named *-1 *PRO*-2 an executive vice president of the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit of this travel and financial services firm.
She retains her duties of human - resources director.
Fujitsu Ltd. said 0 it wants *PRO*-1 to withdraw its controversial one - yen bid *PRO* to design a waterworks computer system for the city of Hiroshima.
Meanwhile, Japan's Fair Trade Commission said 0 it was considering *PRO*-1 launching an investigation into whether the bid, the equivalent of less than a penny, violates anti-monopoly laws.
Hiroshima last week held an auction *PRO*-1 to pick the contractor, *PRO*-1 expecting *PRO*-2 to pay about 11 million yen for the project.
Eight companies submitted bids, but Fujitsu won the contract by *PRO*-1 essentially saying 0 it would do the job for free.
News of the bid drew sharp criticism from other computer companies and industry observers.
Fujitsu itself, which *T*-163 said 0 the bid hadn't been approved *-1 by its headquarters, was clearly embarrassed.
The bid wasn't "socially acceptable," a company spokeswoman said 0 *T*-1.
Hiroshima officials said 0 they still consider the contract in effect and had no immediate plans *PRO* to cancel it.
They said 0 they wanted *PRO*-1 to wait for the outcome of any government investigation before *PRO*-2 deciding what *PRO*-3 to do *T*-164.
Bankers Trust New York Corp. won permission *ICH*-1 from the Federal Reserve Board *PRO* to move the company's private placement department to its fledgling securities subsidiary.
The seemingly mundane action, which *T*-183 was opposed *-1 by the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, has important implications for banks' recent entry into the underwriting of corporate securities.
The Fed's action increases the volume of publicly registered securities that banks' securities affiliates will be able *PRO* to underwrite *T*-1.
Several other banks have similar applications pending.
Over the past two years, the Fed has given a handful of banks' securities affiliates permission *PRO* to underwrite *RNR*-1 and deal in *RNR*-1 a variety of corporate, asset - backed and municipal securities that *T*-184 had previously been the sole domain of securities firms.
Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals, *PRO*-1 saying 0 they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses.
However, the Fed limited the revenue that banks could earn *T*-185 from these new underwriting activities to no more than 10% of the revenue earned * from other securities activities long open to banks, such as *PRO* dealing in U.S. Treasurys.
For some banks that 10% ceiling created problems.
But, by *PRO*-1 allowing BT Securities Inc. to handle private placements, the Fed boosted the volume of new types of underwriting that the unit can do *T*-186.
Private placements involve debt and equity securities, typically in denominations of $1 million *U*, that *T*-187 are sold *-1 to institutional investors and aren't registered *-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last year, Bankers Trust said 0 it placed $10 billion *U* of corporate debt and equities privately.
West Germany will repeal the unpopular turnover tax on securities transactions as of Jan. 1, 1991, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said 0 *T*-1.
He said 0 the government will also repeal the 1% transaction tax on the first - time purchase of stakes in companies.
The announcement follows several comments *ICH*-2 by government officials that the government will speed up the repeal of the tax, which *T*-7 was originally scheduled *-1 *PRO*-8 to fall with the start of the single internal market in the European Community at the end of 1992.
The securities - turnover tax has been long criticized *-1 by the West German financial community because it tends *-2 to drive securities trading and other banking activities out of Frankfurt into rival financial centers, especially London, where trading transactions isn't taxed *-4 *T*-3.
The tax has raised less than one billion marks ($545.3 million *U*) annually in recent years, but the government has been reluctant *PRO*-1 to abolish the levy for budgetary concerns.
In the interview, Mr. Haussmann didn't specify the amount of revenue 0 the government will lose *T*-1 after the tax disappears.
The new date means that the tax will be officially repealed *-1 before the end of the current parliamentary term at the end of 1990 and *PRO*-2 guarantees its abolition even if the current center - right coalition loses the elections in December 1990.
The head of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. said 0 he hopes *PRO*-1 to raise about #450 million *U* ($711 million *U*) before the satellite - TV venture makes its delayed debut next spring--with a major chunk coming from new investors.
"We'll raise it through bank loans.
We'll raise it through {new} equity.
And we'll raise it through existing shareholders" as well as through junk bonds, said *T*-1 Anthony Simonds - Gooding, the private consortium's chief executive.
He said 0 he believes 0 the bank loan, 0 *T*-1 to be arranged *-2 by February, will supply about half of the financing.
British Satellite, which already *T*-200 has raised #423.5 million *U* from 10 backers, initially expected *-1 to seek an additional #400 million *U*.
Mr. Simonds - Gooding said 0 the additional financing may leave British Satellite *PRO*-1 owned *-3 by about 20 investors, including Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond, whose nearly 36% stake *T*-201 would be reduced *-2 to as little as 20%.
Bond Corp., British Satellite's biggest investor, would like *PRO*-1 to withdraw from the satellite - TV consortium, and analysts have speculated 0 Hollywood studios might buy the Bond stake.
But Mr. Simonds - Gooding said 0 he isn't talking to any studios about investing.
Besides Bond Corp., British Satellite's other backers include Pearson PLC, Reed International PLC and Granada Group PLC.
The consortium faced a setback in May when technical problems forced it *PRO*-2 to postpone the September launch until next spring *T*-1.
Continued uncertainty about the timing of the consortium's debut could make it *EXP*-1 hard *PRO* to find a #450 million *U* cash injection.
Mr. Simonds - Gooding conceded that British Satellite's potential U.K. lenders "are saying, ` When you're on the air *T*-1, you'll {actually} get the money."'
The bankers also insist that the loans depend on the consortium raising more money from new and existing backers.
British Satellite today is unveiling a #30 million *U* advertising and promotional drive for the consortium's planned five channels of movies, sports, entertainment and news shows.
As part of the drive, the first 50,000 viewers who *T*-202 put up #10 *U* each will get a package valued * at #170 *U*--including a satellite receiving dish, equipment installation and a three - month subscription to its pay - movie service.
British Satellite faces competition from Sky Television, a satellite - TV venture begun * last February and owned * by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
The rivals currently are locked *-1 in a costly bidding contest for Hollywood film rights.
The Soviet legislature approved a 1990 budget *ICH*-1 yesterday that *T*-2 halves its huge deficit with cuts in defense spending and capital outlays while *PRO*-3 striving *PRO*-4 to improve supplies to frustrated consumers.
The vote *PRO* to approve was
A proposal *PRO* to raise prices of beer, tobacco and luxuries was rejected *-1 338 - 44.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the legislators 0 they had made a good start, but that the most difficult work was still ahead.
The Tass news agency said 0 the 1990 budget anticipates income of 429.9 billion rubles (US$693.4 billion *U*) and expenditures of 489.9 billion rubles (US$790.2 billion *U*).
Those figures are almost exactly what the government proposed *T*-33 to legislators in September.
If the government can stick with them, it will be able *PRO*-1 to halve this year's 120 billion ruble (US$193 billion *U*) deficit.
Officials proposed a cut in the defense budget this year to 70.9 billion rubles (US$114.3 billion *U*) from 77.3 billion rubles (US$125 billion *U*) as well as large cuts in outlays for new factories and equipment.
Tass said 0 the final budget and economic plan calls for a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods.

LUTHER BURBANK CROSS - BRED PLANTS *PRO*-1 to produce the billion - dollar Idaho potato.
Bioengineers set out *PRO*-1 to duplicate that feat--scientifically and commercially--with new life forms.
In 1953, James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic key to heredity.
Twenty years later, two California academics, Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, made "recombinant" DNA, *PRO*-1 transplanting a toad's gene into bacteria, which then *T*-104 reproduced toad genes.
When Boyer met Robert Swanson, an M.I.T. - trained chemist - turned * - *PRO*-2 entrepreneur in 1976 *T*-1, they saw dollar signs.
With $500 *U* apiece and an injection of outside capital, they formed Genentech Inc.
Commercial gene - splicing was born *-1.
Genentech's first product, a brain protein called *PRO* *PRO*-1 somatostatin, proved its technology.
The next 0 *T*-1 to be cloned *-2, human insulin, had market potential and Genentech licensed it to Eli Lilly, which *T*-105 produced 80% of the insulin used * by 1.5 million U.S. diabetics.
Their laboratory credentials established *, Boyer and Swanson headed for Wall Street in 1980.
At the time, Genentech had only one profitable year behind it (a modest $116,000 *U* on revenue of $2.6 million *U* in 1979) and no product of its own on the market.
Nonetheless, the $36 million *U* issue 0 they floated *T*-1 in 1980 opened at $35 *U* and leaped to $89 *U* within 20 minutes.
The trip from the test tube was not without snags.
Boyer and Cohen, for instance, both still university researchers, had *-1 to be talked *-2 into *PRO* applying for a patent on their gene - splicing technique--and then the Patent Office refused *PRO*-3 to grant it.
That judgment, in turn, was reversed *-1 by the U.S. Supreme Court, *PRO* leaving Cohen and Boyer *PRO*-2 holding the first patents for *PRO* making recombinant DNA (now assigned * to their schools).
Gene - splicing now is an integral part of the drug business.
Genentech's 1988 sales were $335 million *U*, both from licensing and its own products.
Cetus Corp. said 0 the government of Spain approved the marketing of its Proleukin interleukin - 2 drug 0 *T*-1 to treat kidney cancer.
The biotechnology concern said 0 Spanish authorities must still clear the price for the treatment, but that it expects *PRO*-1 to receive such approval by year end.
Four other countries in Europe have approved Proleukin in recent months.
Cetus is currently trying *PRO*-1 to obtain federal regulatory clearance for U.S. distribution.
General Motors Corp. is planning *PRO*-3 to build a new engine plant *ICH*-6 in Europe that *T*-5 may be built *-2 in Britain, provided 0 the company can reach a satisfactory agreement with unions, sources said 0 *T*-4.
Officials of Vauxhall Motors Ltd., GM's British unit, were meeting with union leaders late yesterday in hopes of *PRO* winning such an accord.
The engine plant may encompass plans for a joint components venture with Jaguar.
Alternatively, a separate engine plant may be built *-1 as part of GM's planned tie - up with the British luxury car maker, the sources said 0 *T*-2.
Sources said 0 a "complex and detailed" announcement of a joint agreement between General Motors and Jaguar would be made *-1 by Jaguar "some time in the next 2 1/2 weeks.

Applause for "Sometimes, Talk Is the Best Medicine," in your Oct. 5 Marketplace section.
Indeed, the "art of doctoring" does contribute to better health results and discourages unwarranted malpractice litigation.
*PRO* Elaborating on the concern about doctors' sacrificing earnings in order *PRO*-1 to spend "talk time" with patients, we are finding 0 the quality of the time spent * is the key to true rapport.
Even brief conversations can show caring and trust, and need *PRO*-1 not restrict the efficiency of the communication or restrain the doctor's earnings.
The issue is far - reaching.
Right now, the American populace is spending about 12% of our gross national product on health care.
That amounts to more than $350 billion *U* a year.
And it is estimated that more than 20% of that, $70 billion *U*, goes to "defensive medicine"--those measures taken * by doctors *PRO* to protect themselves from the most unlikely possibilities.
So we all stand *PRO*-1 to benefit if patient - physician relations become a "partnership."

Ford Motor Co. said 0 it is recalling about 3,600 of its 1990 - model Escorts because the windshield adhesive was improperly applied *-1 to some cars.
Separately, Ford and Mazda Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm said 0 they are recalling about 88,500 1988 - model Mercury Tracers and 220,000 1986, 1987 and 1988 model Mazda 323s equipped * with 1.6 - liter fuel - injected engines *PRO*-1 to replace the oil filler cap.
Mazda makes the Tracer for Ford.
As a result of the adhesive problem on the Ford Escort subcompacts, windshields may easily separate from the car during frontal impact, the U.S. auto maker said 0 *T*-1.
When *PRO*-2 properly applied *-3 *T*-1, the adhesive is designed *PRO*-2 to retain the windshield in place in a crash test at 30 miles per hour.
A Ford spokesman said 0 the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker isn't aware of any injuries caused * by the windshield problem.
Ford said 0 owners should return the cars to dealers so the windshields can be removed *-1 and securely reinstalled *-1.
Mazda and Ford said 0 a combination of limited crankcase ventilation and improper maintenance could cause engine oil in some of the Mercury Tracers and Mazda 323s to deteriorate more rapidly than normal, *PRO* causing increased engine noise or reduced engine life.
They said 0 the problems aren't safety related.
Both companies will replace the oil filler cap with a ventilated oil filler cap.
Both also will inspect and replace, if necessary, oil filters and oil strainers, at no charge to owners.
For owners who *T*-1 have followed the recommended oil maintenance schedule, Mazda will extend to five years or 60,000 miles the warranty term for engine damage due to abnormal engine oil deterioration.
The normal term for the 1986 and 1987 model 323 is two years or 24,000 miles; the term for the 1988 323 is three years or 50,000 miles.
Ford said 0 the term on its warranty is already six years or 60,000 miles.

BROKERAGE HIRING languishes amid market turmoil.
But survivors earn more.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. counts under 39,000 workers, down 100 from the start of the year and off 8,500 from after its merger and the market collapse two years ago.
Another major firm has cut 6,000 workers, 13% of its staff, since Black Monday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 0 securities firms in New York City alone have slashed 17,000 jobs from the December 1987 peak of 163,000.
Average annual earnings of those who *T*-2 have hung on, though, surged to $78,625 *U* last year from $69,553 *U* in 1987.

SKILLED WORKERS aplenty are available *PRO*-1 to cope with earthquake damage.
"I don't foresee any shortages over the next few months," says *T*-1 Ken Allen, an official of Operating Engineers Local 3 in San Francisco.
Ironically, "up until the quake, we desperately tried *PRO*-1 to fill jobs," especially for crane and bulldozer operators.
But the Oct. 17 temblor put a halt to much nonessential building, and heavy rains last week slowed the rest, *PRO* freeing construction workers for earthquake repairs.
The supply of experienced civil engineers, though, is tighter.
In recent months, California's Transportation Department has been recruiting in Pennsylvania, Arizona and Texas for engineers experienced in road and bridge design.
But, with the state offering only $39,000 *U* a year and California's high standard of living, "there aren't too many 0 *PRO* to choose from *T*-2," says *T*-1 Brent Scott, a recruiting officer.
He says 0 the department now has 75 openings and wants *PRO*-1 to hire 625 civil engineers over the next 15 months.

Employee - benefit specialists drew a collective sigh of relief in early October when the Labor Department backed away from a proposal that companies let former employees and beneficiaries--along with active workers--borrow against balances in 401 (k) and similar savings plans *T*-1.
In an advisory letter, the department said that, starting Oct. 18, loans could be limited *-1 to "parties in interest," which *T*-2 generally means active workers but also includes retirees who *T*-3 continue as directors and 10% shareholders.
Now comes word that IRS regulations being drafted * could put companies in violation of the tax code if they make loans to retiree shareholders and directors but don't make them available to other former workers who *T*-1 usually earned less.
The IRS says 0 the question won't be settled *-1 until the regulations are issued *-2 "shortly."

When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self - managing cooperatives a year later *T*-4, some Western observers assumed 0 Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that *T*-1 would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy.
Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse *T*-2 and that the whole process might be reversed *-1.
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason 0 *PRO* to fear for his future *T*-1, as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied * by civil unrest.
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding *T*-1.
Yet the Soviet leader's readiness *PRO* to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of *PRO* being toppled *-1; nor does he look likely *PRO*-2 to reverse the powers of perestroika.
Indeed, the Soviet miners strike this summer clearly demonstrated that Mr. Gorbachev must proceed with economic reform.
But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of *PRO* making water run uphill?
And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party *PRO*-2 to accept economic change of a kind that *T*-1 will, sooner or later, lead to its demise?
An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed * by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended *-1 to conform to a model other than that of the market.
For example, while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions *ICH*-1 are attached *-2 on how far this may lead *T*-3 to the development of a free market.
Before *PRO*-1 becoming self - employed, or setting up a cooperative, workers must seek permission from the local soviet (council).
Permission is far from automatic: The soviets have the legal right *PRO* to turn down applications and impose conditions, and they appear *-1 to be exercising these powers.
Private dressmaking, for example, is allowed *-1 in 10 Soviet republics but banned *-1 by five; shoemaking is allowed *-2 in seven but illegal in nine.
The controls on cooperatives appeared *-4 relatively liberal when *PRO*-2 first introduced *-3 *T*-1.
But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from *PRO*-1 operating in some areas of the economy, and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state.
All independent media activity is now illegal, which *T*-1 perhaps is not surprising, but so is *T*-2 the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.
Medical cooperatives, among the most successful in the U.S.S.R., are banned *-1 from *PRO*-2 providing general - practitioner services (their main source of income), carrying out surgery, and treating cancer patients, drug addicts and pregnant women.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives: The first enables the soviets *PRO*-4 to set prices for which goods may be sold *-1 *T*-2; the second bans cooperatives from *PRO*-3 buying "industrial and food goods" from the state or other cooperatives.
If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward *PRO*-1 unleashing the productive forces of the market, these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless.
Along with some other revealing indicators, these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes *PRO*-2 to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on *PRO*-3 creating economic structures of a kind that *T*-1 would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought.
Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market *PRO* to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods.
He told the Congress of People's Deputies on May 30: "We do not share this approach, since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country."
*PRO*-4 Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that *T*-1 would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.
*PRO* Most important, this would leave the party *PRO*-1 intact and its monopoly of political power *PRO*-2 largely undisturbed.
Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects *T*-1 spoke specifically of a "third way": of *PRO* having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism.
They, too, promised *PRO*-1 to combine economic efficiency with order and discipline.
The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated *-1 in journalist George Urban's introduction to a series of colloquies--"Can the Soviet System Survive Reform?"--published * this spring.
"Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo--corporation - socialist in form, nationalistic in content and Oriental in style--that *T*-1 will puzzle the world with *PRO* alternating feats of realism and recklessness...."
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared *PRO*-2 to sacrifice themselves for the nation *T*-1.
This unification was *-2 to be brought about through policies and institutions that *T*-1 would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and "harmonic" society.
The key to the creation of the "organic" state lay in the formation of "natural" groups that *T*-1 would undertake the role of decision - making.
By contrast, a parliamentary system based * on abstract political rights and groups was held *-2 to cause *RNR*-1, rather than resolve *RNR*-1, conflict.
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress *T*-1.
In *PRO*-1 doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market.
Instead, he proposed a "law - governed economy," in which there would be a "clear - cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management *T*-1."
The latter would be undertaken *-1 by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives."
These would not function independently, but would act together *PRO*-2 to form "combines, unions and associations" 0 *T*-1 to tackle problems and coordinate their activities.
Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position 0 *PRO* to pursue the corporatist ideal *T*-2 than was Mussolini, who *T*-1 was never able *PRO*-3 to influence business giants such as Pirelli and Fiat *?*.
The Soviet Communist Party has the power *PRO* to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it.
*PRO*-2 To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that *T*-1 will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by *PRO* restricting competition.
However, Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this "alliance" the business sector remains subordinate to the party.
At the same time, he must give it sufficient freedom 0 *PRO* to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed * *T*-1.
It is the promise of economic returns that *T*-3 is supposed *-2 to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor.
The work force provides the third arm of the "alliance."
Within the alliance it is supposed *-3 to act as a balancing force, *PRO*-3 guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed *-1 or its prices be reduced *-2).
By *PRO*-3 providing workers with the opportunity *PRO* to move into the private sector where wages tend *-2 to be higher *T*-1, and by *PRO*-3 holding out the promise of more consumer goods, Mr. Gorbachev hopes *PRO*-3 to revive the popularity of the party.
At the same time, the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who *T*-1 seek genuine Western - style political pluralism.
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for *PRO* marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism.
An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies" and claim that they would be prepared *PRO*-1 to kill in order *PRO*-2 to achieve their aims.
It *EXP*-2 is possible that, in *PRO* perpetuating such myths, the ground is being laid *-3 for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism.
Mr. Gorbachev would appear *-1 to see his central task, however, as that of *PRO* ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid *-2 before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo.
If he were able *PRO*-1 to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system, he or his heir would be wellplaced *PRO*-2 to rein in political opposition, and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe.
The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations--Mr. Gorbachev is a consummate political leader, perhaps one of the greatest--but in its economic prescription.
Contrary to widespread belief, Mussolini failed *-3 to live up to his promise *PRO* to make the trains run on time; it *EXP*-1 is doubtful whether Soviet - style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time, or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave *T*-2.

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it lowered ratings on long - term debt of CS First Boston Inc., the holding company of Wall Street giant First Boston Corp., because of First Boston's "aggressive merchant banking risk" in highly leveraged takeovers.
In *PRO*-1 downgrading CS First Boston's subordinated domestic, Euromarket and Swiss debt to single - A - 3 from single - A - 2, Moody's is matching a move made * by the other major credit rating concern, Standard & Poor's Corp., several months ago.
Moody's also confirmed the Prime - 1 rating, its highest, on CS First Boston's commercial paper, or short - term corporate IOUs.
In addition, Moody's said 0 it downgraded Financiere Credit Suisse - First Boston's senior and subordinated Swiss debt to single - A - 2 from single - A - 1 and lowered Financiere CSFB N.V.'s junior subordinated perpetual Eurodebt, guaranteed * by Financiere Credit Suisse--First Boston, to single - A - 3 from single - A - 2.
About $550 million *U* of long - term debt is affected *-4, according to Moody's.
A spokesman for CS First Boston said: "We remain committed to a full range of businesses, including merchant banking.
We think that the ratings revision is unfortunate but not unexpected.
Our commitment *PRO* to manage these businesses profitably will continue."
First Boston's merchant banking risks mounted last month as highly leveraged Campeau Corp., First Boston's most lucrative client of the decade, was hit *-4 by a cash squeeze and the high - risk junk bond market tumbled.
First Boston incurred millions of dollars of losses on Campeau securities 0 it owned *T*-1 as well as on special securities 0 it couldn't sell *T*-2.
First Boston financings for several other highly leveraged clients, including Ohio Mattress, unraveled as the high - risk junk bond market plummeted.
Moody's said 0 its rating changes actions "reflect CS First Boston's aggressive merchant banking risk as well as the risk profile of its current merchant banking exposures."
It said 0 CS First Boston "has consistently been one of the most aggressive firms in merchant banking" and that "a very significant portion" of the firm's profit in recent years has come from merchant banking - related business.
"Moody's believes that the uncertain environment for merchant banking could put pressure on CS First Boston's performance," the rating concern said *T*-1, *PRO*-2 citing "continued problems" from the firm's exposures to "various Campeau - related firms" and to Ohio Mattress.
"These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston's equity," Moody's said *T*-1.
"Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm's equity.
Nixdorf Computer AG, *PRO*-2 citing continued profitability problems, said 0 it will have *-1 to reduce personnel further, notably in research and development sectors.
The troubled West German computer company said, in a statement to its employees, that the number of persons working in product development will be reduced *-1 world - wide to 2,440 from 2,888 by the end of 1990.
The number of workers in production sectors will be cut *-1 by 488, to 5,200 by September.
The cuts will be made *-1 half within Germany and half abroad.
In the first nine months of 1989, Nixdorf said, 0 sales rose 5% amid good growth in selected areas such as banks and trading companies.
The company also cited some success in *PRO* damping cost increases and said 0 it wants *PRO*-1 to return to profitability in 1990.
It cited the expected beneficial effects of a concentration on key products, further structural changes within the group and cooperation agreements with other companies.
Quotron Systems Inc. plans *PRO*-1 to cut about 400, or 16%, of its 2,500 employees over the next several months.
"This action will continue *-1 to keep operating expenses in line" with revenue, said *T*-2 J. David Hann, president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles - based Quotron.
The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a "response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry, which *T*-1 has been contracting" since October 1987's stock market crash, the executive added 0 *T*-2.
Quotron, which Citicorp purchased *T*-1 in 1986, provides price quotations for securities, particularly stocks.
Quotron also provides trading and other systems, services for brokerage firms, and communications - network services.
Independent providers of financial information, including Quotron, have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try *PRO*-1 to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue.
Shearson, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group 0 *T*-1 to sell securities - price data.
The job cuts, 0 *T*-2 to be made *-1 in a number of areas at various job levels, are "a streamlining of operations," a spokeswoman said 0 *T*-3.
The company has no immediate plans *PRO* to close any operations, she said 0 *?*, but Quotron may subcontract some work that it has been doing *T*-2 in - house, including refurbishment and production of Quotron 1000 equipment used * in *PRO* delivering financial data.
The spokeswoman said 0 the move isn't directly a response to Quotron's loss of its two biggest customers, Merrill Lynch & Co. and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., to Automated Data Processing Inc. earlier this year.
The spokeswoman noted that last week, Kidder, Peabody & Co., the securities subsidiary of General Electric Co., chose a Quotron subsidiary 0 *T*-1 to provide order - processing services.
And Oct. 24, Quotron said 0 it will market the automated trading system of broker - dealer Chapdelaine Government Securities Inc.
Quotron isn't profitable on Citicorp's books because of the interest charges 0 the New York bank holding company incurred *T*-1 in *PRO*-3 buying the financial - data concern for $680 million *U*, says 0 *T*-2 Ronald I. Mandle, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
But Citicorp "does view Quotron) as *PRO*-2 being crucial to the financial - services business in the 1990s," the analyst added 0 *T*-1.
This past summer, Quotron sold its customer - service unit, employing 600, to Phoenix Technologies Inc., a closely held computer - service firm in Valley Forge, Pa.

Died: Robert V. Van Fossan, 63, chairman of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., Sunday, in Morristown, N.J., of cancer.
The commercial was absolutely silent.
*PRO* Breaking into the raucous Chicago Bears - Cleveland Browns match during last week's Monday night football game, it was nothing but simple block letters superimposed * on the TV screen.
"Due to the earthquake in San Francisco, Nissan is donating its commercial air time *PRO*-1 to broadcast American Red Cross Emergency Relief messages.
Please *PRO* contribute what you can *?* *T*-1," the ad said *T*-2.
The Nissan logo flashed on the screen for a moment, and then came a taped plea for donations from former President Reagan--*PRO*-2 followed *-3 by the silent print telling viewers where *PRO* to call *T*-1.
Within two hours, viewers pledged over $400,000 *U*, according to a Red Cross executive.
*PRO* Call it *PRO*-1 disaster marketing.
Nissan Motor is just one of a slew of advertisers that *T*-1 have hitched their ads to the devastating San Francisco quake and Hurricane Hugo.
Sometimes, the ads attempt *PRO*-1 to raise money; always, they try *PRO*-2 to boost good will.
By *PRO*-1 advertising disaster relief, these companies are hoping *PRO*-1 to don a white hat and come out a hero.
But the strategy can backfire; if the ads appear *-2 too self - serving, the companies may end up *PRO*-1 looking like rank opportunists instead of good Samaritans.
That hasn't deterred plenty of companies.
Along with Nissan, Grand Metropolitan PLC's Burger King and New York Life Insurance have tied ads to Red Cross donations.
Other ads don't bother with the fundraising; a touching, if self - congratulatory, American Telephone & Telegraph ad that *T*-1 aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston, S.C., with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped *T*-2.
At Nissan, "we felt 0 we wanted *PRO*-2 to do something *PRO*-3 to help them gather money, and we had this airtime on Monday Night Football," explains 0 *T*-1 Brooke Mitzel, a Nissan advertising creative manager.
"What did we get *T*-1 out of it?
We got some exposure...and pretty much good will."
The ads are just the latest evidence of how television advertising is getting faster on the draw *T*-1.
While TV commercials typically take weeks *PRO* to produce *?*, advertisers in the past couple of years have learned *PRO*-1 to turn on a dime, *PRO*-2 to crash out ads in days or even hours.
The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash, when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market *T*-1.
They trotted out another crop of instant commercials after the sudden market dip a few weeks ago.
Nissan created its quake ad in a weekend.
But as advertisers latch onto disasters with increasing frequency, they risk *PRO*-1 hurting themselves as much as *PRO*-1 helping the cause.
They chance *PRO*-2 alienating the customers 0 they hope *PRO*-3 to woo *T*-1 by *PRO*-4 looking like opportunistic sharks.
"People see extra messages in advertising, and if a manufacturer is clearly trying *PRO*-1 to get something out of it...if it's too transparent...then consumers will see through that," warns *T*-2 John Philip Jones, chairman of the advertising department at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.
"It can backfire because companies can step across the line and go too far, be too pushy," agrees *T*-1 Gary Stibel, a principal with New England Consulting Group, Westport, Conn.
"The ultimate form of charity is when you don't tell anyone *T*-1."
Still, he says that only a few of the quake - related campaigns have been "tasteless" and that "the majority have been truly beneficial to the people who *T*-1 need the help.
We don't consider that ambulance chasing."
The companies running the disaster ads certainly don't see themselves as ambulance chasers, either.
Burger King's chief executive officer, Barry Gibbons, stars in ads saying that the fast - food chain will donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger.
The campaign, which *T*-1 started last week and runs through Nov. 23, with funds earmarked * for both the quake and Hugo, "was Barry's idea," a spokeswoman says 0 *T*-2.
"Barry felt very committed.
He felt 0 we should be giving something back."
While the campaign was Mr. Gibbons's idea, however, he won't be paying for it: The donations will come out of the chain's national advertising fund, which *T*-2 is financed *-1 by the franchisees.
And by *PRO*-3 basing donations on BK Doubles, a new double - hamburger line 0 the fast - food chain is trying *PRO*-2 to push *T*-1, Burger King works a sales pitch into its public - service message.
Toyota's upscale Lexus division, a sponsor of the World Series, also put in a plug for Red Cross donations in a World Series game 0 it sponsored *T*-1.
"The World Series is brought *-4 to you by Lexus, who *T*-1 urges you *PRO*-2 to help *PRO*-5 relieve the suffering caused * by the recent earthquake...," the game announcer said *T*-3.
And New York Life made a plea for Red Cross donations in newspaper ads in the San Francisco area, *PRO*-1 latching onto the coattails of the Red Cross's impeccable reputation: "The Red Cross has been helping people for 125 years.
New York Life has been doing the same for over 140 years."
Nancy Craig, advertising manager for the Red Cross, readily admits "they're piggybacking on our reputation."
But she has no problem with that, she says 0 *T*-1: "In the meanwhile, they're helping us."
The Red Cross doesn't track contributions raised * by the disaster ads, but it has amassed $46.6 million *U* since it first launched its hurricane relief effort Sept. 23.

The American Stock Exchange said 0 a seat was sold *-1 for $160,000 *U*, down $5,000 *U* from the previous sale last Friday.

The Treasury Department proposed that banks be required *-2 *PRO*-3 to keep detailed records of international wire transfers, which officials believe 0 *T*-1 is the main vehicle used * by drug traffickers *PRO* to move billions of dollars in and out of the U.S. .
In recent testimony on Capitol Hill, Treasury officials said 0 they were considering the new reporting requirements, and the expected publication of the proposal in the Federal Register today is the first official step toward *PRO* creating final regulations.
The Treasury is still working out the details with bank trade associations and the other government agencies that *T*-1 have a hand in *PRO* fighting money laundering.
Among the possibilities 0 the Treasury is considering *T*-1 are *T*-2 requirements that banks keep records identifying the originators and recipients of international wire transfers.
Another suggestion would draw banks more directly into *PRO*-3 tracking down money launderers by *PRO* developing a "suspicious international wire transfer profile," which banks would use *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to spotlight questionable payments.
But banks may prefer *PRO*-2 using a profile that *T*-1 targets selected transactions, rather than a blanket reporting requirement.
Banks now are required only *-1 *PRO*-2 to report cash deposits or withdrawals of $10,000 or more *U*.
But wire transfers from a standing account--including those bigger than $10,000 *U*--aren't reported *-1.
Officials believe 0 this has left a gaping loophole that illegal drug businesses are exploiting *T*-1.
Authorities estimate that revenues from illegal drugs in the U.S. total about $110 billion *U* annually.
Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that *T*-1 oversees the issue of money laundering, criticized the proposal for *PRO*-3 ignoring wire transfers between foreign banks that *T*-2 are executed and cleared *-4 on U.S. wire systems.
The American Bankers Association didn't have any comment on the plan.
The proposal now enters a 60 - day comment period, after which the Treasury will propose final regulations *T*-1, followed * by another comment period.
West German insurance giant Allianz AG entered the takeover battle between France's Cie . Financiere de Paribas and Cie. de Navigation Mixte.
Allianz said 0 it won French government approval *PRO* to buy as much as one - third of Navigation Mixte, a diversified financial, transport and food holding company.
The move comes a week after Paribas announced that it was preparing *PRO*-1 to bid for 66.7% control of Navigation Mixte.
Munich - based Allianz's brief explanatory statement said 0 it is acting *PRO*-1 to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte.
That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte.
Each had claimed Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, as a tacit ally.
The Allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one.
It led to broad market speculation that Paribas now will sweeten its bid, which *T*-1 is expected *-2 to be formally launched later this week, after approval from French government regulators.
Allianz's entry reflects the increasing eagerness *ICH*-3 of West German companies, looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992, *PRO* to get involved in what *T*-2 until now were considered *-1 internal French affairs.
Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness *PRO*-1 to expand in France before 1992.
Dresdner Bank this month moved *PRO*-1 to acquire Banque Internationale des Placements, a small French merchant bank that Deutsche Bank had looked at *T*-2 and passed *T*-2 over.
Commerzbank had hoped *PRO*-1 to buy a stake in Credit Lyonnais, until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans *PRO* to privatize the large French bank.
Deutsche Bank has actively sought a French acquisition for at least two years.
Lately, analysts say 0 *?*, Deutsche Bank has shocked some in the French financial community by *PRO*-2 indicating 0 it wants a strong bank with a large number of branches.
"We are still looking," said *T*-1 a Deutsche Bank spokesman.
"The banks 0 we think 0 *T*-1 would fit into our concept are either government - owned or not for sale, though Deutsche Bank would be able *PRO*-2 to pay a good price."
While Allianz officials weren't willing *PRO*-2 to comment in any detail on their plans, they said 0 Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% *U* of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced *T*-1.
Paris market sources said 0 they believed 0 Allianz was buying yesterday morning, and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ($17.19 *U*) *PRO*-1 to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading.
It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday, when Paribas announced its plan *PRO* to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte share *T*-1.
Allianz also holds a 50% stake in Navigation Mixte's insurance subsidiary, one of France's largest insurance groups, which it bought *T*-1 for about 6.5 billion francs just before Paribas launched its bid.
Navigation Mixte holds the remaining 50%.
Allianz said in its statement that it was acting *PRO*-2 to protect that interest, which *T*-1 ties it to Navigation Mixte as a partner.
Allianz's statement stressed the company's previously announced * position that Paribas's offer price is too low.
Allianz also suggested, without *PRO*-1 saying so directly, that it regrets that Paribas isn't bidding for all of Navigation Mixte's shares.
The problem here, analysts say 0 *?*, is that if Paribas wins its 66.7%, remaining Navigation Mixte shares will fall in value.
That displeases many current holders, such as Allianz, which *T*-1 couldn't be sure of *PRO*-2 selling all their shares if they tendered to Paribas.
The Allianz statement led to speculation that Allianz eventually could sell to Paribas.
That would be bad news for Navigation Mixte's current management, which *T*-1 was counting on Allianz *PRO*-2 to help *PRO*-3 fend off Paribas.
Allianz didn't say whom, if anyone, it will support *T*-1.
It said simply that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days *PRO*-1 to protect itself, as long as it has French regulatory officials' approval.
Paribas currently intends *PRO*-2 to offer 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that *T*-1 receive full dividends this year.
It is *-2 to offer 1,800 francs for shares created * on July 1, which *T*-1 receive partial dividends.
Alternatively, it would offer *PRO*-1 to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share.
Paribas already holds about 18.7% of Navigation Mixte, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid.
The bid values Navigation Mixte at around 23 billion francs, depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants *T*-1 exchange them for shares before the bid expires.
Hospital Regulation Sparks Kentucky Feud
WHICH *T*-1 IS the best medicine for runaway health costs: competition or regulation?
The question is at the root of a brawl between Humana Inc., the big for - profit hospital and insurance company, and its not - for - profit brethren in its home state of Kentucky.
The battle focuses on the state's certificate - of - need law, which *T*-1 regulates investment in new medical technology.
The law has prevented $216 million *U* of unnecessary expenditures since 1986, according to William S. Conn, president of the Kentucky Hospital Association.
But according to David Jones, Humana's chief executive, it promotes technology monopolies, stifles innovation and raises prices.
If the Legislature doesn't repeal the law, due for revision in 1990, Mr. Jones says 0 Humana may move its insurance operations, including 3,000 jobs in Louisville, to another state.
The company complains that it paid $10 million *U* to non-Humana hospitals in its latest fiscal year for services provided * to its insurance plan members.
But Humana says 0 its own facilities could serve its insured for less if they were properly equipped.
Mr. Conn charges that Humana's own actions undermine its argument.
When a hospital in Lexington installed a lithotripter last year *T*-1, demand for a similar kidney - stone smashing machine at a Humana hospital in Louisville fell 34%.
The Humana hospital responded by *PRO*-3 jacking up prices *PRO*-4 to make up for lost revenue, Mr. Conn says 0 *?*, and now charges as much as $8,000 *U* for the procedure, which *T*-1 costs only about $3,500 *U* in Lexington.
Humana contends that $8,000 *U* represents an extreme case and that its regular charge for lithotripsy is $4,900 *U*.
Meanwhile, another hospital's proposal for a new - generation lithotripter is pending before the board that *T*-1 administers the certificate - of - need law.
Humana, which *T*-1 wants *PRO*-3 to acquire one of the new machines itself, is on the record as opposed to the proposal.
Debt - Burdened Doctors Seek Financial Security
HEALTH - CARE experts have long worried that young doctors emerging from medical school with a mountain of debt will choose careers in high - paying specialties instead of primary care, where more physicians are needed *-1 most *T*-2.
Now there's a new wrinkle *ICH*-2 in what young doctors want *T*-1: More than half of 300 residents responding to recent survey said 0 they'd prefer a guaranteed salary over traditional fee - for - service compensation in their first professional position.
And 81% preferred a group practice or health maintenance organization, while just 11% favored solo practice.
"Ten years ago, a physician would go to a town and take out a loan (*PRO*-3 to start a practice)," says *T*-2 James Merritt, president of Merritt, Hawkins & Associates, an Irvine, Calif., physician recruiter that *T*-1 conducted the survey.
"They won't do that very often today at all.
They're looking for something that *T*-1's very safe."
The numbers behind such fears: The average debt of medical school graduates who *T*-3 borrowed *PRO*-2 to pay for their education jumped 10% to $42,374 *U* this year from $38,489 *U* in 1988, says 0 *T*-1 the Association of American Medical Colleges.
That's 115% more than in 1981.
Money isn't the only reason for the shift in practice preferences.
It reflects values of a generation that *T*-1 wants more time for families and personal interests, says *T*-3 John H. Moxley III, who *T*-2 directs physician - executive searches for Korn / Ferry International.
"This is a change in the social fabric of medicine," he says *T*-1.
Related Roommates Trim Hospital Bills
WHEN Catherine Bobar spent several weeks at the Medical Center of Vermont recently with a bone infection in her toe *T*-1, she shared a room just like most patients.
But unlike most patients, her roommate was her husband.
"It *EXP*-3 was certainly good *PRO* to have him handy," Mrs. Bobar says *T*-1.
The 12 - bed "cooperative care" unit is one of about 18 nationwide where a family member or friend helps care for a patient in the hospital *T*-1.
"The philosophy is *PRO* to make the patient and the family very responsible for a portion of their own care," says *T*-1 Anthony J. Grieco, medical director of cooperative care at New York University Medical Center, where the concept began 10 years ago *T*-2.
"It helps us, and them, while they're here, and it certainly makes them a better health - care team when they get home *T*-1."
It also saves money.
Because patients require less attention from nurses and other staff, room charges are lower--about $100 *U* less per day than a regular room at the Vermont hospital.
Cancer patients needing prolonged radiation therapy, diabetics learning *PRO* to manage their blood sugar levels, and cardiac bypass patients are among those who *T*-1 spend time on cooperative - care units.
The approach has generated so much interest that NYU is host to the first conference on cooperative care Nov. 30.
"It's really part of the hospital of the 21st century," Dr. Grieco says *T*-1.
Odds and Ends
THE CHIEF NURSING officer can be responsible for more than 1,000 employees and at least one - third of a hospital's budget; a head nurse typically oversees up to 80 employees and $8 million *U*.
So says *T*-3 the Commonwealth Fund, a New York philanthropist that *T*-1's sponsoring a $1 million *U* project 0 *PRO* to develop joint masters in business and nursing programs at 10 universities *T*-2....
Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., launches a new research publication *ICH*-1 in the spring: the Journal on Health Care for the Poor and Underserved.
Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 2.4% to 535,322 units in September from a year earlier, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said 0 *T*-1.
The association attributed the drop to a trend *ICH*-1 among auto makers *PRO* to move manufacturing operations overseas.
With the exception of August, when exports rose 2.1% *T*-1, exports have declined every month from year - earlier levels since March.
Medical scientists are starting *-2 to uncover a handful of genes which *T*-3, if *PRO*-4 damaged *-5, unleash the chaotic growth of cells that *T*-1 characterizes cancer.
Scientists say 0 the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops *T*-1.
An emerging understanding of the genes is expected *-1 to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention.
That is for the future.
Already, scientists are developing tests based * on the newly identified genes that *T*-1, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely *-2 to get cancer.
"It's a super-exciting set of discoveries," says *T*-2 Bert Vogelstein, a Johns Hopkins University researcher who *T*-1 has just found a gene pivotal to the triggering of colon cancer.
"Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing *T*-1 at the molecular level.
Today, we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state."
Scientists call the new class of genes *PRO*-1 tumor - suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.
When *PRO*-3 functioning normally *T*-2, they make proteins that *T*-1 hold a cell's growth in check.
But if the genes are damaged *-1--perhaps by radiation, a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division--their growth - suppressing proteins no longer work, and cells normally under control turn malignant.
The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered * in the early 1980s called * *PRO*-1 oncogenes.
Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal *RNR*-1 as well as in cancerous *RNR*-1 cells, *PRO* suggesting that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves.
In recent months, researchers have come *PRO*-2 to believe 0 the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells *PRO*-3 malignant only after the tumor - suppressor gene has been damaged *-1.
Like all genes, tumor - suppressor genes are inherited *-1 in two copies, one from each parent.
Either copy can make the proteins needed * *PRO* to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired.
A person who *T*-3 is born *-1 with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged *-2 early in life *T*-4, is especially prone to cancer because he need only *PRO*-5 lose the other copy for a cancer to develop.
Emerging genetic tests will be able *PRO*-1 to spot such cancer - susceptible individuals, *PRO* ushering in what some scientists believe 0 *T*-2 is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis.
Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings.
The Dedham, Mass., couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of *PRO* being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that *T*-1 occurs about once every 20,000 births.
Mr. Quinlan, 30 years old, knew 0 he carried a damaged gene, *PRO*-3 having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old *T*-1--after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby *T*-2.
Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor - suppressor gene, it *EXP*-1 became possible last January *PRO* to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced *T*-2.
A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of *PRO* developing the rare cancer.
"It made our New Year," says *T*-1 Mr. Quinlan.
This test was the first 0 *T*-2 to predict reliably whether an individual could expect *PRO*-1 to develop cancer.
Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that *T*-1 controls retinal cell growth, made * by a Boston doctor named * *PRO*-3 Thaddeus Dryja, has opened a field of cancer study, which *T*-2 in recent months has exploded.
"It turns out that *PRO* studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer," says *T*-1 Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute.
"All this may not be obvious to the public, which *T*-1 is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced 0 this basic research will begin *-2 showing results there soon."
To date, scientists have fingered two of these cancer - suppressors.
Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.
Then last spring, researchers reported *PRO*-2 finding a gene called * *PRO*-5 p53 which *T*-1, if *PRO*-3 impaired *-4, turns healthy colon cells *PRO*-6 cancerous.
Soon after that report, two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers.
Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year.
Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the U.S., Canada and Britain, are racing *PRO*-1 to unmask other suspected tumor - suppressing genes.
They have about seven candidates.
Researchers say 0 the inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears *-1 crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.
There is evidence that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, *PRO* perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem *-2 to haunt certain families *T*-1.
The story of tumor - suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named * *PRO*-2 Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects *T*-1.
He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other.
The tumor, he suggested 0 *?*, developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged *-1 *T*-3.
But there was no way 0 *PRO* to prove Dr. Knudson's "two - hit" theory *T*-1.
Back then, scientists had no way of *PRO* ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that *T*-1 contain the genes.
Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible.
Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who *T*-1 had had the disease.
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.
He assumed 0 the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss *T*-1 had a critical role in *PRO* setting off the cancer.
But he didn't know which gene or genes *T*-1 had disappeared.
Then, a scientific team led * by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer.
The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that *T*-1 can track a gene's presence in a cell.
By *PRO*-1 analyzing cells extracted * from eye tumors, they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome.
The finding riveted medicine.
It was the first time 0 anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer *T*-1.
"It was extraordinarily satisfying," says *T*-1 Dr. Knudson, now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia.
"I was convinced that what *T*-1 was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers."
It was an audacious claim.
But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed 0 Dr. Knudson was right, and set out *PRO*-1 to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.
His was one of two research teams 0 *T*-1 in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called * *PRO*-3 Wilm's tumor.
Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer.
He believed 0 colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems *-1 to develop in stages.
It often is preceded *-1 by the development of polyps in the bowel, which *T*-2 in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages--*PRO*-3 progressing from less severe to deadly--as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring.
Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes *PRO*-1 searching for signs of genetic damage.
They began *-1 uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells.
Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged.
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop.
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted *-1, the polyps would progress to malignancy.
It *EXP*-3 was clear that more than one gene had *-2 to be damaged *-1 for colon cancer to develop.
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists.
"It was the confirming evidence *ICH*-2 0 we all needed *T*-1 that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor," says *T*-3 Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City.
But Dr. Vogelstein had yet *-2 to nail the identity of the gene that *T*-1, if *PRO*-3 damaged *-4, flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy.
They focused on chromosome 17.
For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, *PRO*-1 using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, *PRO*-1 looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost * in all tumor cells.
Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene.
When they found it last winter *T*-1, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over.
His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called * *PRO*-1 p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.
The deletion 0 Dr. Vogelstein found *T*-1 was in exactly the same spot as p53.
But Mr. Levine had said 0 the p53 gene caused cancer by *PRO*-2 promoting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that *T*-1 suppressed growth.
Despite that, when the Johns Hopkins scientists compared the gene 0 they had found *T*-2 in the human cancer cells with the Mr. Levine's p53 gene *T*-1 they found 0 the two were identical; it turned out that in Mr. Levine's cancer studies, he had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of p53--a cancer - suppressing gene.
The discovery "suddenly puts an obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation," says 0 *T*-1 Robert Weinberg, a leader in cancer - gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
Evidence *ICH*-2 now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers, too.
Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated *-1 at the spot where gene p53 lies *T*-2.
The scientists say that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when *PRO* inherited in a damaged form *T*-1, may predispose women to the cancer.
The p53 gene has just been implicated *-1 in lung cancer.
In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken * from lung cancer tissue 0 they tested *T*-1 are missing this gene.
There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of missing p53 genes in tissue taken * from kidney, brain and skin cancers.
At the same time, the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing *PRO*-1 to pinpoint other tumor - suppressor genes.
Dr. Vogelstein hopes *PRO*-1 soon to isolate one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer.
Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are close to *PRO*-1 finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought * to be on chromosome 5.
Dr. Minna believes 0 people who *T*-1 inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.
Recently, he and others reported that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as several other more common cancers, too.
Where these discoveries will lead *T*-1, scientists can only speculate *T*-2.
Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol - Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann - La Roche Inc., are collaborating with gene hunters *PRO*-1 to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies.
Some researchers say 0 new cancer drugs 0 *T*-1 to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based *-2 on the suppressor proteins normally produced * by the genes.
The idea would be *PRO* to administer to patients the growth - controlling proteins made * by healthy versions of the damaged genes.
It *EXP*-1 may even be possible *PRO* to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close *PRO*-2 to doing that so far.
In any case, says 0 *?* Dr. Minna of the National Cancer Institute, "We're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer.
The French Economics Ministry approved a planned asset swap between the defense and electronics group Thomson - CSF S.A. and the bank group Credit Lyonnais.
The ministry said 0 the swap, details of which *T*-2 were disclosed *-1 last Thursday, will allow both state - controlled companies to reinforce operations in their main markets and argued that the move shows the dynamism of France's state - sector concerns.
The approval also ends any hope that Banque Nationale de Paris, another state - sector bank, might have had *T*-1 about *PRO* taking Credit Lyonnais's place in the accord.
It hinted over the weekend that it would have been interested in a hook - up with Thomson - CSF.
Under details of the accord, Credit Lyonnais will take slightly more than 50% of Thomson - CSF Finance in exchange for about 14% of its own shares.
The move will help the bank to keep up with international solvency ratios being phased * in by the Bank for International Settlements and will also represent the first time that its voting shares have been held *-1 by a party other than the government *T*-2.

A group of Michigan investors has offered *PRO*-2 to buy Knight - Ridder Inc.'s ailing Detroit Free Press for $68 million *U* but has left *PRO* *EXP*-4 *PRO*-5 unclear how the offer will be financed *-1 *T*-3.
The offer came just prior to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court over whether the Free Press should be allowed *PRO*-1 to enter into a joint operating pact with Gannett Co.'s Detroit News.
The group led * by Birmingham, Mich., publicist William D. McMaster didn't name an investment banker backing the deal or say how much its members will contribute *T*-1 to the offer.
Indeed, some individuals identified * with the group said 0 they haven't committed any money to the bid and weren't aware of it until they heard about it in local news accounts over the weekend.
Knight - Ridder wouldn't comment on the offer.
The company has said 0 the paper isn't for sale, and has rebuffed Mr. McMaster's earlier requests for access to Free Press financial statements.
In his letter to Knight - Ridder President James K. Batten, Mr. McMaster said 0 he arrived at the $68 million *U* figure *PRO*-1 using Knight - Ridder's corporate financial statements and comments by Knight - Ridder officials that the Free Press has a $50 million *U* value in salvage.
But in an interview, Mr. McMaster said 0 he and his investment banker would need access to full financial records before *PRO*-1 firming up the offer.
Warner Communications Inc. is close to an agreement *PRO* to back a new recorded music and music publishing company in partnership with Irving Azoff, who *T*-1 resigned in September as head of MCA Inc.'s MCA Records unit.
Warner and Mr. Azoff declined comment, as did MCA, where Mr. Azoff had also been discussing such a venture *T*-1 *?*.
But record industry executives familiar with the talks said 0 Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement *ICH*-1 yesterday *PRO* to form a 50 - 50 joint - venture company funded * by Warner and run * by Mr. Azoff.
Among other things, they said 0 *?*, Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label.
The agreement is said *-1 to be similar to Warner's 50 - 50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records *T*-2 are distributed *-51 by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.
Although Mr. Azoff won't produce films at first, it *EXP*-1 is possible that he could do so later, the sources said 0 *T*-2.
Like Mr. Geffen's arrangement, the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the U.S. alone, Warner has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, Sony Corp.'s CBS Records.
For Warner, meanwhile, it gives the company a second young partner with a finger on the pulse of the hottest trends in the music business.
The 41 - year - old Mr. Azoff, a former rock 'n' roll manager, is credited *-1 with *PRO*-2 turning around MCA's once - moribund music division in his six years at the company.
But Mr. Azoff had been negotiating for more than a year *PRO*-2 to get out of his MCA contract, which *T*-1 expired in 1991.
Mr. Azoff reportedly was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans.
Mr. Azoff also was eager *PRO*-2 to return to a more entrepreneurial role in which he had a big financial stake in his own efforts *T*-1.
In an interview at the time of his resignation from MCA, he said: "I'd rather *ICH*-1 build a company than *PRO* run one.
Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati, said 0 it agreed in principle *PRO*-1 to acquire Noranda Inc.'s Carol Cable Co. unit for $177 million *U*.
The company said 0 Carol Cable, based * in Pawtucket, R.I., is a leading supplier of electrical and electronic wire and cable for the distributor, retail and original equipment manufacturer markets.
Carol Cable, which *T*-1 operates 12 manufacturing plants, had operating profit of $11.7 million *U* on sales of $153.3 million *U* for the first six months of this year and operating profit of $25.6 million *U* on sales of $294.6 million *U* for all of 1988.
The maker of telecommunications and defense equipment said 0 Carol Cable's portfolio and market focus would complement the company's current wire and cable businesses.
The plan is subject to a satisfactory due diligence investigation of Carol Cable by Penn Central, a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals.
Vernon E. Jordan was elected *-1 to the board of this transportation services concern.
Mr. Jordan has served as executive director of the United Negro College Fund, director of the Voter Education Project of the Southern Regional Council and attorney - consultant to the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity.
His election increases Ryder's board to 14 members.
Revco D.S. Inc., the drugstore chain that *T*-1 filed for bankruptcy - court protection last year, received a $925 million *U* offer from a group led * by Texas billionaire Robert Bass.
Revco reacted cautiously, *PRO*-1 saying 0 the plan would add $260 million *U* of new debt to the highly leveraged company.
It *EXP*-1 was Revco's huge debt from its $1.3 billion *U* leveraged buy - out in 1986 that *T*-2 forced it *PRO*-3 to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
Revco insists that the proposal is simply an "expression of interest," because under Chapter 11 Revco has "exclusivity rights" until Feb. 28.
Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from *PRO*-1 proposing a reorganization plan.
Also under Chapter 11, a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders, banks and other creditors.
A financial adviser for Revco bondholders, David Schulte, of Chilmark Partners, had mixed reactions to the offer.
He said 0 he feared 0 a Revco reorganization might force bondholders *PRO*-1 to accept a "cheap deal," and that the Bass group's offer would give them more money.
However, the group is offering *PRO*-1 to pay off bondholders in cash only--$260.5 million *U*--and no equity.
The Revco bonds are high - yield, high - risk "junk" bonds; holders have $750 million *U* in claims against Revco, Mr. Schulte said 0 *T*-1.
Revco received the offer Oct. 20, but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made *-1 public by bondholders.
Acadia Partners Limited Partnership, a Fort Worth, Texas, partnership that *T*-1 includes the Robert M. Bass Group, made the proposal.
Mr. Bass is based *-1 in Fort Worth.
Analysts said 0 the nation's second - largest drugstore chain was a valuable company, despite its financial woes.
Its problem, they say *?*, is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy - out and the current $515 million *U* debt load is keeping Revco *PRO*-1 in the red.
"If *PRO* bought at the right price, it could still be profitable," said *T*-1 Jeffrey Stein, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland.
In addition, Revco's 1,900 stores in 27 states represent a lot of real estate, he said 0 *?*, and demographics are helping pharmacies: The nation's aging population will boost demand for prescription drugs.
Last week, Revco's parent company, Anac Holding Corp., said 0 the company reported a loss of $16.2 million *U* for the fiscal first quarter, compared with a loss of $27.9 million *U* in the year - earlier quarter.
Sales were $597.8 million *U*, up 2.4% from the previous year.
The company, based * in Twinsburg, Ohio, said 0 its operating profit before depreciation and amortization increased 51%, to $9.2 million *U* from $6.1 million *U*.
Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
The partnership also includes American Express Co., Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
The offer consists of $410.5 million *U* in cash and the rest in notes.
Acadia would sell up to 10% of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution, but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares.
Revco's chairman and chief executive officer, Boake A. Sells, said 0 both the company and the bondholders have put forth reorganization plans, but little progress has been made *-1 since negotiations began this summer.
He said 0 he has not met with representatives from Acadia.
Any reorganization proposal, Mr. Sells said 0 *?*, is difficult 0 *PRO* to assess *T*-3 because it must be agreed upon *-2 by the company, bondholders, banks and other creditors.
Revco has $1.5 billion *U* in claims outstanding.
"It's not like the board can decide" by itself, Mr. Sells said 0 *T*-1, *PRO*-2 adding, "we're indifferent to (the Bass) plan.
We just want a plan that *T*-1 satisfies creditors and *T*-1 at the end leaves a healthy Revco."
But Mr. Schulte, the bondholders' adviser, said 0 Revco was dragging its feet in *PRO*-1 responding to the proposal.
"They want *PRO*-2 to pretend 0 it doesn't exist," he said *T*-1.
Mr. Schulte, who *T*-1 met with Acadia representatives on Oct. 10, said, "It's certainly a responsible offer.
It's not an effort *PRO* to steal the company" in the middle of the night.
James River Corp., Richmond, Va., said 0 it acquired the tissue operations of Buhrmann - Tetterode N.V. of the Netherlands for about $77 million *U*.
The Dutch unit, known * as Celtona B.V., is a leading maker of consumer and away - from - home tissue products for the Benelux region.
In addition, the acquisition includes production assets of Invercon Papermils, a maker of household tissue products for the U.K. and Ireland.
The combined operations had 1988 revenue of about $100 million *U*.
James River, a maker of pulp, paper and plastic products, already has interests in tissue businesses in France, Spain, Italy and Turkey.
The company said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to form European ventures with Italian and Finnish companies.
The Celtona operations would become part of those ventures.
Copper futures prices failed *-1 to extend Friday's rally.
Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down.
The December contract was down three cents a pound, *PRO*-2 settling at $1.1280 *U*, which *T*-1 was just above the day's low of $1.1270 *U*.
Futures prices fell during three of five sessions last week, and the losses, individually and cumulatively, were greater than the advances.
Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico, were finally resolved *-1.
Also, the premiums paid * by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than *PRO* expected, and acted as a price depressant, analysts said 0 *T*-1.
The mint purchases were at premiums about 4 1/2 cents a pound above the respective prices for the copper.
At the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound.
All this has led to prolonged selling in futures, mostly on the part of computer - guided funds.
Prices fell through levels regarded * as important support areas, which *T*-1 added to the selling.
The reluctance *ICH*-1 of traders *PRO* to buy contracts indicates that they have begun *-2 focusing on demand rather than supply.
At least one analyst noted that as production improves, the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies.
"Demand from Japan is expected *-3 to continue *PRO*-4 strong, but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year," he said *T*-2.
Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea.
Recently, Japan has been buying copper elsewhere.
But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin *-2 operating, they are expected *-1 to resume their roles as Japan's suppliers.
According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, New York, "Highland Valley has already started *-1 operating and Cananea is expected *-2 to do so soon."
The Bougainville mine is generally expected *-1 to remain closed until at least the end of the year.
It hasn't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners.
A recent attempt *PRO* to resume operations was cut *-1 *PRO*-2 short quickly by these attacks.
However, traders disregarded a potential production disruption in Chile and a continued drop in inventories.
Workers at two Chilean mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which *T*-1 belong to the Exxon - owned Minera Disputado group, will vote Thursday on whether *PRO*-2 to strike after a two - year labor pact ends today.
The mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988.
According to Drexel's Mr. Demler, the potential strike is expected *-3 to be resolved *-1 quickly, which *T*-2 may be one reason why the situation didn't affect prices much *T*-4.
Another analyst said that, if there was any concern, it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in Chile.
London Metal Exchange copper inventories fell 550 tons last week to 83,950 tons, a smaller - than - *PRO* expected *-1 decline.
But that development also had little effect on traders' sentiment.
Mr. Demler said that stocks of copper in U.S. producers' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons.
Outside the U.S., he said 0 *?*, producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons, down 3,000 tons from the end of July.
Consumer stocks of copper in the U.S. fell to 44,000 tons at the end of September from 54,000 tons a month earlier, and stocks of copper held * by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons, down from 125,000 tons in June.
The high point of foreigners' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April, according to Mr. Demler.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:
The prices of most corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued *-2 to rebuild stockpiles that *T*-3 were depleted *-1 by the 1988 drought.
Buying by the Soviets has helped *PRO*-1 to prop up corn prices in recent weeks, but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums.
COFFEE:
Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled * with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved *-1.
The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents.
According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports *ICH*-1 over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia, at the Pan-American summit meeting in Costa Rica, had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of *PRO* creating a new agreement.
The reports, attributed * to the Colombian minister of economic development, said 0 Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags, the analyst said 0 *T*-3.
These reports were later denied *-2 by a high Brazilian official, who *T*-1 said 0 Brazil wasn't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas, the analyst said 0 *T*-3.
The Colombian minister was said *-2 to have referred to a letter that he said 0 President Bush sent *T*-1 to Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and in which President Bush said *T*-3 0 it *EXP*-4 was possible *PRO* to overcome obstacles to a new agreement.
The minister was also quoted *-2 as *PRO*-3 saying that a new pact could be achieved *-1 during the first half of next year, according to the analyst.
PRECIOUS METALS:
Futures prices showed modest changes in light trading volume.
December delivery gold eased 40 cents an ounce to $380.80 *U*.
December silver was off 3.7 cents an ounce at $5.2830 *U*.
January platinum rose 90 cents an ounce at $500.20 *U*.
The market turned quiet after *PRO*-1 rising sharply late last week, according to one analyst.
Last week's uncertainty in the stock market and a weaker dollar triggered a flight to safety, he said 0 *?*, but yesterday the market lacked such stimuli.
There was some profit - taking because prices for all the precious metals had risen to levels at which there was resistance to further advance *T*-2, he said 0 *T*-1.
The dollar was also slightly firmer and prompted some selling, as well, according to the analyst.
If there's somethin' strange in your neighborhood ...
If there's something' weird and it don't look good.
Who ya gon *PRO*-2 na call *T*-1?
For starters, some people call Ed and Lorraine Warren.
When it comes to *PRO* busting ghosts *T*-1, the Monroe, Conn., couple are perfect demons.
They claim *PRO*-1 to have busted spirits, poltergeists and other spooks in hundreds of houses around the country.
They say 0 they now get three or four "legitimate" calls a week from people harried * by haunts.
"I firmly believe in angels, devils and ghosts," says *T*-2 Mr. Warren, whose business card *T*-1 identifies him as a "demonologist."
If psychics don't work, but your house still seems *-1 haunted, you can call any one of a swelling band of skeptics such as Richard Busch.
*PRO*-1 A professional magician and musician, he heads the Pittsburgh branch of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
Mr. Busch says 0 there is a scientific explanation for all haunts, and he can even tell you how *PRO* to encourage the spirits *T*-1.
"All 0 you have *-2 to do *T*-1 is eat a big pizza, and then go to bed," he says *T*-3.
"You'll have weird dreams, too."
Either way, the ghostbusting business is going like gangbusters.
Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation's Elm Streets and Amityvilles.
"I get calls *ICH*-1 nearly every day from people who *T*-2 have ghosts in their house," says *T*-3 Raymond Hyman, a skeptical psychology professor at the University of Oregon.
In a public opinion poll published * in the October issue of Parents Magazine, a third of those queried * said 0 they believe that ghosts or spirits make themselves known to people.
"The movies, the books, the tabloids--even Nancy Reagan is boosting this stuff," says *T*-2 Paul Kurtz, a philosophy professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who *T*-1 heads the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal.
The committee, formed * in 1967, now has 60 chapters around the world.
The spirits, of course, could hardly care less whether people do *RNR*-1 or don't *RNR*-1 believe in them.
They don't even give a nod to human sensibilities by *PRO*-1 celebrating Halloween.
For the spooks it's just another day of ectoplasmic business as usual, ghostbusters say 0 *T*-1; the holiday seems *-2 to occasion no unusual number of ghost reports.
One of the busiest ghostbusters is Robert Baker, a 68 - year - old semi-retired University of Kentucky psychology professor whose bushy gray eyebrows *T*-1 arch at the mere mention of a ghost.
Mr. Baker says 0 he has personally bested more than 50 haunts, from aliens to poltergeists.
Mr. Baker heads the Kentucky Association of Science Educators and Skeptics.
Like Hollywood's Ghostbusters, Kentucky's stand *PRO*-2 ready *PRO*-3 to roll when haunts get out of hand *T*-1.
But they don't careen around in an old Cadillac, wear funny suits or blast away at slimy spirits.
Mr. Baker drives a 1987 Chevy and usually wears a tweed jacket on his ghostbusting forays.
"I've never met a ghost that *T*-1 couldn't be explained away *-3 by perfectly natural means," he says *T*-2.
When a Louisville woman complained that a ghost was haunting her attic *T*-1, Mr. Baker discovered a rat dragging a trap across the rafters.
A foul - smelling demon supposedly plagued a house in Mannington, Ky.
Mr. Baker found an opening under the house that *T*-1 led to a fume - filled coal mine.
When the weather cools *T*-1, Mr. Baker says 0 *?*, hobos often hole up in abandoned houses.
"People see activity in there, and the next thing 0 you know *T*-1, you've got a haunting," he says *T*-2.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Baker and a reporter go *PRO*-2 ghost - busting, *PRO*-3 visiting Kathleen Stinnett, a Lexington woman who *T*-1 has phoned the University of Kentucky *PRO*-4 to report mysterious happenings in her house.
Mrs. Stinnett says 0 she never believed in ghosts before, but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on, a telephone flew off its stand, doors slammed inexplicably, and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen.
"I was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck *PRO*-3 running upstairs *PRO*-4 to see who *T*-1 was there, and it was nobody," she says *T*-2, eyes wide at the recollection.
Mr. Baker hears her out, pokes around a bit, asks a few questions and proposes some explanations.
Of the self - starting vacuum cleaner, he says: "*PRO* Could be Cuddles, {Mrs. Stinnett's dog}."
The flying telephone: "You tangle the base cord around a chair leg, and the receiver does seem *-1 to fly off."
The ghostly footsteps: "Interstate 64 is a block away, and heavy traffic can sure set a house to *PRO*-1 vibrating."
"I'm not sure 0 he's explained everything," Mrs. Stinnett says *T*-1 grudgingly.
"There are some things that *T*-1 have gone on here that nobody can explain *T*-3," she says *T*-2.
Mr. Baker promises *PRO*-1 to return if the haunting continues.
For especially stubborn haunts, Mr. Baker carries a secret weapon, a vial of cornstarch.
"I tell people 0 it's the groundup bones of saints," he says *T*-1.
"I sprinkle a little around and tell the demons *PRO*-1 to leave.
It's reassuring, and it usually works."
Oregon's Mr. Hyman has investigated claims of flying cats, apparitions and bouncing chandeliers and has come up with a plausible explanation, he says, for every one.
"Invariably," he says *?*, "eyewitnesses are untrustworthy."
Two years ago, a Canadian reader bet Omni Magazine $1,000 *U* that it couldn't debunk the uncanny goings - on in "the Oregon Vortex," a former Indian burial ground in southern Oregon.
To viewers from a distance, visitors to the spot seemed *-1 to shrink disproportionately, relative to the background.
The magazine called in Mr. Hyman as a consultant.
He showed up with a carpenter's level, carefully measured every surface and showed how the apparent shrinkage was caused *-1 by the perspective *T*-2.
"A very striking illusion," Mr. Hyman says *-1 now, his voice dripping with skepticism, "but an illusion nevertheless."
The Canadian wound up *PRO*-1 writing a check.
The Rev. Alphonsus Trabold, a theology professor and exorcism expert at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y., frequently is asked *-1 *-2 *PRO*-3 to exorcise unruly spirits, and he often obliges.
"On certain occasions a spirit could be earthbound and make itself known," he says *T*-1.
"It happens."
Father Trabold often uses what he calls *T*-1 "*PRO*-3 a therapeutic exorcism": a few prayers and an admonition *ICH*-2 to the spirit *PRO* to leave.
"If the person believes 0 there's an evil spirit, you ask it *PRO*-3 to be gone *-1," he says *T*-2.
"The suggestion itself may do the healing."
But sometimes more energetic attacks are required *-1.
*PRO*-2 To wrestle with a demon in a house owned * by a Litchfield, Conn., woman, the Warrens recently called in an exorcist, the Rev. Robert McKenna, a dissident clergyman who *T*-1 hews to the Catholic Church's old Latin liturgy.
I attend, and so does *T*-1 a television crew from New York City.
Mr. Warren pronounces the Litchfield case "your typical demonic infestation."
A Scottish dwarf built the small red house 110 years ago and now his demonic ghost haunts it, Mr. Warren says 0 *T*-1.
The owner, who *T*-1 begs anonymity, asserts that the dwarf, *PRO*-2 appearing as a dark shadow, has manhandled her, *PRO*-2 tossing her around the living room and yanking out a hank of hair.
Two previous exorcisms have failed.
"This is a very tenacious ghost," Mr. Warren says *T*-1 darkly.
Father McKenna moves through the house *PRO*-1 praying in Latin, urging the demon *PRO*-2 to split.
Suddenly the woman begins swaying and then writhing.
"She's being attacked *-1 by the demon," Mrs. Warren stagewhispers *T*-2 as the priest sprinkles holy water over the squirming woman, and the television camera grinds.
A half - hour later, the woman is smiling and chatting; the demon seems *-1 to have gone.
But Mr. Warren says 0 the woman has "psychic burns" on her back from the confrontation.
She declines *PRO*-1 to show them.
"This was an invisible, powerful force that *T*-1's almost impossible 0 for a layman to contemplate *T*-2," Mr. Warren says *T*-3 solemnly as the ghostbusting entourage packs up *PRO*-4 to leave.
"This time though," he says *?*, "I think 0 we got it."

Bargain hunters helped stock prices break a weeklong losing streak while bond prices and the dollar inched higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 6.76 points to 2603.48 in light trading after *PRO*-1 losing more than 92 points last week.
Bond prices continued *-1 to edge higher in anticipation of more news showing a slower economy.
Although the dollar rose slightly against most major currencies, the focus in currency markets was on the beleaguered British pound, which *T*-1 gained slightly against the dollar.
Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange dwindled to only 126.6 million shares yesterday as major brokerage firms continued *-1 to throw in the towel on program trading.
Kidder Peabody became the most recent firm 0 *T*-1 to swear off stock - index arbitrage trading for its own account, and Merrill Lynch late yesterday took the major step of *PRO* renouncing the trading strategy even for its clients.
Yet that didn't eliminate program trading from the market.
The Dow industrials shot up 23 points in the opening hour, at least in part because of buy programs generated * by stock - index arbitrage, a form of program trading involving futures contracts.
But interest waned as the day wore on and investors looked ahead to the release later this week of two important economic reports.
The first is Wednesday's survey of purchasing managers, considered a good indicator of how the nation's manufacturing sector fared in October *T*-1.
The other is Friday's measure of October employment, an indicator of the broader economy's health.
Both are expected *-2 to show continued sluggishness, which *T*-1 would be good for bonds and bad for stocks.
In major market activity: Stock prices rose in light trading.
But declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered gainers 774 to 684, and broader market indexes were virtually unchanged.
Bond prices crept higher.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond gained about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.92%.
The dollar gained.
In late New York trading the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8340 marks and 141.90 yen, compared with 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen Friday.
The British pound, *PRO*-1 pressured * by last week's resignations of key Thatcher administration officials, nevertheless rose Monday to $1.5820 *U* from Friday's $1.5795 *U*.

New construction contracting climbed 8% in September to an annualized $274.2 billion *U*, with commercial, industrial and public - works contracts providing most of the increase, according to F.W. Dodge Group.
Through the first nine months of the year, the unadjusted total of all new construction was $199.6 billion *U*, flat compared with a year earlier.
The South was off 2% after the first nine months, while the North Central region was up 3%.
The Northeast and West regions were unchanged.
A small decline in total construction for the entire year is possible if contracting for housing doesn't increase in response to this year's lower mortgage rates, said 0 *T*-1 George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist of Dodge, the forecasting division of publisher McGraw - Hill Inc.
The seasonally adjusted Dodge Index reached 175 *ICH*-1 in September, its highest level this year, from 162 in August.
The index uses a base of 100 in 1982.
Newly contracted residential work edged up 2% in September to an annualized $121.2 billion *U*, largely because multifamily building rebounded from a very weak August.
"At the end of the third quarter, there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates," Mr. Christie said *T*-1.
Housing has been weak all year and especially so in the past five months.
Contracting for non-residential buildings rose 10% in September to an annualized $100.8 billion *U*.
Commercial and industrial construction rose sharply, partly because of three large projects, each expected *PRO* to cost more than $100 million *U*.
Institutional building, such as hospitals and schools, eased in September following a surge in August.
Although the third quarter was the best *ICH*-1 so far this year for non-residential building, weakness early in the year held the nine - month total to $69.6 billion *U*, up just 1% from a year earlier.
Public - works and utility projects, also known * as non-building contracting, grew 18% to $52.2 billion *U* in September, but the nine - month total of $36.9 billion *U* was down 3% from a year earlier.
The Sept. 30 end of the federal fiscal year may have prodded contractors *PRO*-3 to get any behind - schedule road and bridge construction under way "before the clock ran out," Mr. Christie said 0 *T*-1, *PRO*-2 referring to threatened 5% across - the - board budget cuts.
a - Monthly construction contract values are reported *-1 on an annualized, seasonally adjusted basis.
Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said 0 the nation's No. 3 auto maker will need *-1 to close one or two of its assembly plants because of the slowdown hitting the industry.
In an interview with the trade journal Automotive News, Mr. Iacocca declined *PRO*-2 to say which plants *T*-1 will close or when Chrysler will make the moves *T*-3.
But he said, "we have too many plants in our system.
So the older or most inefficient capacity has got *-1 to go."
According to industry analysts, Chrysler plants most likely *PRO* to close are the St. Louis No. 1 facility, which *T*-1 builds Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models; the Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant, which *T*-2 dates back to the early 1900s; and two Canadian plants that *T*-3 build the Jeep Wrangler and Chrysler's full - sized vans.
Chrysler has had *-1 to temporarily close the St. Louis and Toledo plants recently because of excess inventories of vehicles built * there.
At Chrysler's 1990 model preview last month, Chrysler Motors President Robert A. Lutz said 0 the No. 3 auto maker, along with other U.S. manufacturers, might be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to "realign...capacity" if market demand doesn't improve.
But Mr. Iacocca's remarks are the most specific indication to date of how many plants *T*-1 could be in jeopardy.
General Motors Corp. has signaled that as many as five of its U.S. and Canadian plants may not survive the mid-1990s as it struggles *PRO*-1 to trim its excess vehicle - production capacity.
The overcapacity problem has intensified in recent years, with foreign auto makers beginning car and truck production in the U.S. .
With companies such as Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. running so - called transplant auto operations, Japanese auto production in the U.S. will reach one million vehicles this year.
"Unless the market goes to 19 million units--which we all know 0 it's not going *-3 to do *T*-1--we have the inescapable fact that the transplants are adding capacity," Mr. Lutz said *T*-2 last month.
The Japanese - managed plants eventually will have the capacity *PRO* to build some 2.5 million vehicles in the U.S. and that will translate into "market share that *T*-1 is going *-2 to have *-3 to come out of somebody," he added 0 *T*-4.
Already Chrysler has closed the Kenosha, Wis., plant 0 it acquired *T*-1 when it bought American Motors Corp. in 1987 *T*-2.
Chrysler has also launched a $1 billion *U* cost - cutting program that *T*-1 will cut about 2,300 white - collar workers from the payroll in the next few months.
The dollar finished mostly stronger yesterday, *PRO*-1 boosted *-2 by a modest recovery in share prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 6.76 points in a spate of bargain - hunting following last week's declines.
"Attention is fixed *-3 on the stock market for lack of anything else 0 *PRO* to sink our teeth into *T*-1," said *T*-2 Robert White, a vice president at First Interstate of California.
Some analysts predict that in the absence of market - moving news 0 *T*-1 to push the U.S. unit sharply higher or lower, the currency is likely *-2 to drift below 1.80 marks this week.
But others reject the view, and forecast 0 the dollar will continue *-1 to hold its current tight trading pattern.
They argue that weakness in both the yen and sterling have helped *PRO*-1 offset bearish U.S. economic news and have lent support to the dollar.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8340 marks, up from 1.8300 marks late Friday, and at 141.90 yen, up from 141.65 yen late Friday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.5820 *U*, up from $1.5795 *U* late Friday.
The dollar rose against the Swiss and French francs.
In Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.32 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.17 yen.
Last week, the surprise resignation of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent the British pound into a tailspin.
While sterling bounced back from session lows in a bout of short - covering yesterday, foreign exchange dealers said that any hopes that the pound would soon post significant gains have evaporated.
Traders said that statements made * over the weekend *PRO* to quell concern about the stability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government and the future of her economic program largely failed *-2 to reassure investors and bolster the flagging British unit.
In her first televised interview following Mr. Lawson's resignation, Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her desire *PRO* to keep sterling *PRO*-1 strong and warned again that full entry into the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism would provide no easy solution to Britain's economic troubles.
She said that the timing of the United Kingdom's entry would depend on the speed with which other members liberalize their economies *T*-1.
Mrs. Thatcher's remarks were seen *-1 as a rebuff to several leading members of her own Conservative Party who *T*-2 have called for a more clear - cut British commitment to the EMS.
At the same time, a recent poll shows that Mrs. Thatcher has hit the lowest popularity rating of any British leader since polling began 50 years ago.
Comments by John Major, who *T*-1 has succeeded Mr. Lawson, also failed *-2 to damp market concern, despite his pledge *PRO* to maintain relatively high British interest rates.
According to one London - based analyst, even higher interest rates won't help the pound if Britain's government continues *-1 to appear *-2 unstable.
One U.S. trader, however, dismissed sterling doomsayers while *PRO*-1 acknowledging 0 there is little immediate upside potential for the U.K. unit.
"There is no question that the situation is bad, but we may be painting a gloomier picture than we should *?*," he said *T*-1.
He predicts 0 the pound will continue *-1 to trade in a very volatile fashion, with "fits of *PRO* being oversold and overbought *-2" before *PRO*-1 recovering its losses.
Dealers also note that the general lack of enthusiasm for the yen has helped *PRO*-1 bolster the U.S. dollar.
They observe that persistent Japanese investor demand for dollars for both portfolio and direct investment has kept a base of support for the dollar at around 140 yen.
The dollar began yesterday on a firm note in Tokyo, *PRO* closing higher in late trade.
In Europe, the dollar closed slightly up in a market dominated * by cross trades.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $377.80 *U* an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted *-1 at $376.80 *U* an ounce.
Giant Group said 0 a federal court in Delaware has denied a motion by Rally's Inc. seeking *PRO* to block a group led * by Giant Chairman Burt Sugarman from *PRO*-1 acquiring more of the company's shares.
Rally's, a fast - food chain based * in Louisville, Ky., is contending that Mr. Sugarman and two other company directors failed *-1 to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Commission that they intended *PRO*-2 to acquire a big Rally stake.
Mr. Sugarman has in turn contended that the other major shareholder group--whose interests *T*-2 are represented *-1 by three other directors connected * to trusts in the name of the children of the company's founder, James Patterson--has ties to a competing fast food chain, Wendy's International Inc.
The company last week assembled a three - member committee of directors aligned * with neither side *PRO* to analyze the situation.
Each group controls more than 40% of Rally's stock.
The company just went public earlier this month.
Rally's had no comment, but was expected *-2 to make an announcement *ICH*-1 this morning about the situation.
Mitsui & Co. said 0 it started a joint venture with Dae Woong Chemical Co., a major pharmaceutical manufacturer in South Korea, 0 *PRO* to manufacture antibiotic medicines *T*-1.
The new company is capitalized *-1 at about $3.5 million *U*.
Mitsui expects the antibiotic products to be exported *-2 to Southeast Asia and Africa.
It also hopes *PRO*-1 to enter the U.S. market.
Cray Research Inc. won government clearance for its proposed reorganization of founder Seymour Cray's supercomputer design team into a separate company.
Internal Revenue Service approval of the move as a tax - free transaction was the last hurdle to *PRO* splitting up the world's dominant maker of supercomputers, which Mr. Cray founded *T*-1 in 1974.
Cray's directors set Nov. 15 as the record date for distribution of shares in the new company, 0 *T*-2 to be called *-1 *PRO*-3 Cray Computer Corp.
It will trade over the counter under the symbol CRAY.
The plan calls for Cray Research holders to receive one share in the new company for every two shares held *.
An estimated 14.7 million Cray Computer shares will be distributed *-1, Cray Research said 0 *T*-2.
Under the accord, Cray Research will transfer to Mr. Cray's fledgling operation $53.3 million *U* of assets primarily related * to the Cray - 3 development project 0 his team is undertaking *T*-1 and will lend Cray Computer $98.6 million *U*.
Cray Research will retain a 10% interest in the new company, which *T*-2 will be based *-1 in Colorado Springs, Colo.
When it announced the planned breakup in May *T*-1, Cray Research said 0 development costs of several competing projects were squeezing its earnings growth.
After the split, the two companies presumably will be rivals for orders from government and commercial customers.
G.D. Searle & Co. said 0 the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of Kerlone, a hypertension drug developed * by a joint venture between Searle and a French concern.
Searle, a unit of Monsanto Co., said 0 the "beta - blocker" high - blood - pressure drug Kerlone is the first product 0 *T*-1 to reach the market through Lorex Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. company jointly owned * by Searle and Synthelabo, a French pharmaceutical concern owned * by France's L'Oreal S.A.
USG Corp. agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its headquarters building here to Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. of Toronto, and will lease the 19 - story facility until it moves to a new quarters in 1992.
The building - materials concern didn't disclose terms of the sale, which *T*-1 will close in the first quarter of next year.
Proceeds from the planned sale of the 250,000 - square - foot building "will help *PRO*-2 reduce the debt incurred * as a result of our July 1988 recapitalization," said *T*-1 a USG official.
The New York Times Co. said 0 it reached a settlement with independent home delivery dealers in the metropolitan New York area that *T*-1 will free the newspaper to expand home delivery circulation.
The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit 0 the dealers filed *T*-1 in 1982 when the Times began its own competing direct delivery service *T*-2.
The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $3.6 million *U* over six years, as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years, based * on the number of "new customers started * by the dealers and on pricing structures," the Times said 0 *T*-1.
The amount of the settlement will be taken *-1 as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.
The settlement, which *T*-1 involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York area, will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system.
Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times's 1.1 million daily circulation.
Currently, about 60% of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times.
Eastern Airlines' creditors committee backed off a move 0 *T*-1 to come up with its own alternative proposals to the carrier's bankruptcy reorganization plans, according to sources familiar with the committee.
In a meeting in New York yesterday, the committee put on hold instructions *ICH*-1 0 it gave *T*-2 two weeks ago to its experts *PRO* to explore other options for Eastern's future, the sources said 0 *T*-3.
The consultants had been working *PRO*-1 to finish a report this week.
That means 0 Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston, can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today, when it is expected *-2 to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee *T*-1.
The committee intends *PRO*-1 to meet next week *PRO*-2 to make a recommendation on the new plan.
In another development yesterday, creditors were told *-1 that $40 million *U* 0 they had expected *T*-2 to become available for *PRO* implementing a reorganization may not materialize, according to one source.
Texas Air has run into difficulty *PRO* reselling about $20 million *U* of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market, the person said 0 *T*-1.
And plans *PRO* to raise another $20 million *U* through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag, the source said 0 *T*-1.
An Eastern spokesman said "the $40 million *U* will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern's plan.
Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant."
It *EXP*-2 is unclear what *T*-1 caused the creditors to do an about - face on *PRO* exploring alternatives to Eastern's new reorganization plan.
However, since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, it has consistently promised *PRO*-1 to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar.
Because the carrier is still pledging *PRO*-1 to do that, some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason *ICH*-3 yet 0 *PRO* to explore a different plan *T*-2, according to one person familiar with the creditors' position.
Earlier this month the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., the experts hired * by the creditors, contended that Eastern would have difficulty *PRO*-1 meeting earnings targets 0 the airline was projecting *T*-2.
Ernst & Young said 0 Eastern's plan would miss projections by $100 million *U*.
Goldman said 0 Eastern would miss the same mark by at least $120 million *U*.
The consultants maintained 0 Eastern wouldn't generate the cash 0 it needs *T*-1 and would have *-2 to issue new debt *PRO*-3 to meet its targets under the plan.
Eastern at the time disputed those assessments and called the experts' report "*PRO*-1 completely off base."
Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined *PRO*-2 to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed *-1 *PRO*-3 to look at other choices and whether they now were asked *-4 *-5 not *PRO*-6 to *?*.
He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating.
"In every case, people would like *PRO*-1 to see a consentual plan," he said *T*-2.
Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that *T*-1 called for the carrier to sell off $1.8 billion *U* in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two - thirds its former size.
Eastern eventually decided *PRO*-3 not to sell off a major chunk, its South American routes, which *T*-2 were valued *-1 at $400 million *U*.
Such a change meant 0 the reorganization plan 0 the creditors had agreed on *T*-1 was no longer valid, and the two sides had *-2 to begin *-3 negotiating again.
Eastern has publicly stated 0 it is exceeding its goals for *PRO* getting back into operation and has predicted 0 it would emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings early next year, *PRO*-1 operating more flights than it originally had scheduled *?*.
The recently revived enthusiasm among small investors for stock mutual funds has been damped *-1 by a jittery stock market and the tumult over program trading.
After *PRO*-1 hitting two - year highs this summer, net sales of stock funds slowed in September, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group.
The sales recovery screeched to a halt this month, some analysts say 0 *T*-1.
"Confidence was starting *-2 to come back because we didn't have wildly volatile days," says *T*-1 Tyler Jenks, research director for Kanon Bloch Carre & Co., a Boston research firm.
"Now everything"--such as program trading and wide stock market swings--"that everyone had pushed back in their consciousness is just sitting right there."
Net sales of stock funds in September totaled $839.4 million *U*, down from $1.1 billion *U* in August, the institute said 0 *T*-1.
But if reinvested dividends are excluded *-1, investors put in only $340 million *U* more than they pulled out for the month.
October's numbers, which *T*-3 won't be released *-1 for a month, are down further, mutual fund executives say 0 *T*-2.
Investors in stock funds didn't panic the weekend after mid-October's 190 - point market plunge.
Most of the those who *T*-1 left stock funds simply switched into money market funds.
And some fund groups said 0 investors actually became net buyers.
But the stock market swings have continued.
The recent outcry over program trading will cast a pall over the stock - fund environment in the coming months, some analysts say 0 *T*-1.
"The public is very close to *PRO* having had it," Mr. Jenks says *T*-1.
Investors pulled back from bond funds in September, too.
Net sales of bond funds for the month totaled $1.1 billion *U*, down two - thirds from $3.1 billion *U* in August.
The major reason: heavy outflows from high - risk, high - yield junk bond funds.
Big withdrawals from the junk funds have continued this month.
Overall, net sales of all mutual funds, excluding money market funds, fell to $1.9 billion *U* in September from $4.2 billion *U* in August, the trade group said 0 *T*-1.
"Small net inflows into stock and bond funds were offset *-1 by slight declines in the value of mutual fund stock and bond portfolios" stemming from falling prices, said 0 *T*-2 Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist.
Many small investors went for the safety of money market funds.
Assets of these and other short - term funds surged more than $5 billion *U* in September, the institute said 0 *T*-1.
Analysts say 0 additional investors transferred their assets into money funds this month.
At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund group, money funds continue *-1 to draw the most business, says 0 *T*-2 Michael Hines, vice president, marketing.
In October, net sales of stock funds at Fidelity dropped sharply, Mr. Hines said 0 *T*-1.
But he emphasized that new accounts, new sales, inquiries and subsequent sales of stock funds are all up this month from September's level.
Investor interest in stock funds "hasn't stalled at all," Mr. Hines maintains 0 *T*-1.
He notes that most of the net sales drop stemmed from a three - day period following the Friday the 13th plunge.
"If that follows through next month, then it will be a different story," he says *T*-1.
But, Mr. Hines adds, 0 sales "based * on a few days' events don't tell you much about October's trends."
One trend that *T*-1 continues is growth in the money invested * in funds.
*PRO*-3 Buoyed *-1 by the continued inflows into money funds, assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $953.8 billion *U* in September, up fractionally from $949.3 billion *U* in August.
Stock - fund managers, meantime, went into October with less cash on hand than they held *?* earlier this year.
These managers held 9.8% of assets in cash at the end of September, down from 10.2% in August and 10.6% in September 1988.
Large cash positions help buffer funds from market declines but can cut down on gains in rising markets.
Managers of junk funds were bolstering their cash hoards after the September cash crunch at Campeau Corp.
Junk - portfolio managers raised their cash position to 9.4% of assets in September from 8.3% in August.
In September 1988, that level was 9.5%.
Investors in all funds will seek safety in the coming months, some analysts say 0 *T*-1.
Among stock funds, the conservative growth - and - income portfolios probably will remain popular, fund specialists say 0 *T*-1.
"There will be a continuation and possibly greater focus on conservative equity funds, at the expense of growth and aggressive growth funds," says *T*-1 Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York fund - research concern.
The Supreme Court let stand a New York court's ruling that the manufacturers of a drug once used * *PRO* to prevent miscarriages must share liability for injuries or deaths when the maker of an individual dose is unknown *T*-1.
The high court's action, *PRO* refusing *PRO*-2 to hear appeals by several drug companies, is likely *-1 to have a significant impact at several levels.
The most immediate effect is in New York, where former manufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drug DES--the synthetic female hormone diethylstilbestrol--face the prospect of shared liability for damages in many of the 700 to 1,000 DES lawsuits pending in that state *T*-1.
The lawsuits stemmed from the development of cancer and other problems in the daughters of women who *T*-1 took the drug.
On a broader scale, the ruling could encourage other states' courts *PRO*-1 to adopt the logic of the New York court, not only in DES cases but in other product - related lawsuits, as well.
The New York Court of Appeals ruling parallels a 1980 decision by the California Supreme Court requiring shared liability among manufacturers for injuries when it can't be determined which company *T*-2 is at fault *T*-3.
Paul Rheingold, a New York lawyer who *T*-1 represents DES victims, said that before the New York ruling, only the states of Washington and Wisconsin had followed the California decision.
Now that the New York decision has been left *-1 *PRO*-2 intact, other states may follow suit.
"Generally, when New York and California go one way *T*-2, it has a tremendous influence on other states, especially small ones," said *T*-1 Mr. Rheingold.
The high court refused *PRO*-2 to hear appeals by Rexall Drug Co., which *T*-1 went out of business in 1987 and was taken *-3 over by RXDC Liquidating Trust; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc., a unit of Squibb Corp.; and Eli Lilly & Co.
The appeals involved DES, which *T*-2 was approved *-1 by the Food and Drug Administration for use from the 1940s until 1971 *PRO* to prevent miscarriages during pregnancy.
In 1971, the FDA banned the use of DES after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who *T*-1 took the drug.
Lawsuits over the harm caused * by DES have flooded federal and state courts in the past decade.
In many cases, the lawsuit was filed *-1 long after the drug was used *-2--the cancer in the daughters was typically not detected *-4 for years--and there is no way 0 *PRO* to prove which of several companies *T*-3 manufactured the doses consumed * by certain women *T*-5.
Under traditional legal theories, inability *PRO* to prove which company *T*-1 manufactured a drug that *T*-2 caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed *-3.
But in its ruling last April, the New York court said that all producers of the anti-miscarriage drug should share liability when the manufacturer of a specific dose can't be determined *-1 *T*-2.
Each company's share of liability would be based *-1 on their share of the national DES market.
The New York court also upheld a state law, passed * in 1986, extending for one year the statute of limitations on *PRO* filing DES lawsuits.
The effect is that lawsuits that *T*-2 might have been barred *-3 because they were filed *-1 too late could proceed because of the one - year extension.
(Rexall Drug Co. vs. Tigue; E.R. Squibb & Sons Inc. vs. Hymowitz, and Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Hymowitz)
Government Contractors
Last year, the Supreme Court defined when companies, such as military contractors, may defend themselves against lawsuits for deaths or injuries by *PRO*-2 asserting that they were simply following specifications of a federal government contract *T*-1.
In that decision, the high court said 0 a company must prove that the government approved precise specifications for the contract, that those specifications were met *-1 and that the government was warned *-2 of any dangers in use of the equipment.
But last February, a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a damage award against General Dynamics, *PRO*-1 rejecting the company's use of the government contractor defense.
The appeals court said 0 the defense is valid only if federal officials did more than *PRO* rubber stamp a company's design or plans and engaged in a "substantive review and evaluation" on a par with a policy decision.
General Dynamics appealed to the high court, *PRO*-1 backed *-2 by numerous business trade groups, *PRO*-1 arguing that the appeals court definition restricts the defense too severely.
General Dynamics was sued *-1 by the families of five Navy divers who *T*-3 were killed *-2 in 1982 after they re-entered a submarine through a diving chamber.
The accident was caused *-1 by faulty operation of a valve.
A federal district court awarded damages to the families and the appeals court affirmed the award.

Court in Brief
In other action yesterday, the high court:
-- Let stand the mail fraud and conspiracy conviction of John Lavery, a former vice president of Beech - Nut Nutrition Corp., a unit of Nestle S.A.
The conviction stemmed from federal charges of consumer fraud for sale of phony infant apple juice between 1978 and 1983.
(Lavery vs. U.S. .)
-- Left *PRO*-1 intact an award of $1.5 million *U* in damages against Dow Chemical Co. in the death of an Oregon man from exposure to Agent Orange.
The award was made *-1 by a federal court to the widow of a U.S. Forest Service employee who *T*-2 contracted Hodgkin's disease after *PRO*-3 using herbicides containing Agent Orange in a weed - killing program.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges.
The suit, filed * in federal court in Manhattan, charges that New York's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law.
Separately, the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge's age - bias suit in federal court in New Haven.
The commission's filing in that case challenges Connecticut's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges.
The New York suit was filed *-1 on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin, whose appointment to the state appellate division *T*-2 expires at year end, and all other judges hurt * by the alleged age discrimination.
The suit, assigned * to federal Judge Kimba Wood, seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who *T*-1 have been forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary *PRO* to eradicate the effects of (New York's) unlawful employment practices."
Justice Rubin, a state judge since 1969, said 0 the mandatory - retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of *PRO* serving on the bench.
"The issue isn't age--age is just a number.
The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability *PRO* to serve on the bench," Justice Rubin said *T*-1.
"I've had no problems *PRO* performing my duties and responsibilities."
Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible *PRO*-2 to be reappointed *-1 to the bench at the end of the year.
The suit's impact on New York may be narrow, however.
Most New York judges are elected *-1, and the federal age - discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials, said 0 *T*-2 James L. Lee, regional attorney for the EEOC in New York.
Under New York law, elected judges must retire at age 70, but then can be appointed *-1 to two - year terms until they reach 76.
A spokeswoman for the state's Office of Court Administration declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the suit.
But she said 0 the state currently has 35 appointed judges who *T*-1 are over 70.
In Connecticut, however, most state judges are appointed *-1 by the governor and approved *-1 by the state legislature.
The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed *PRO*-1 to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age - bias case against Vermont.
In the Vermont case, a federal judge ruled that the state's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal; Vermont's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan.
Aaron Ment, Connecticut's chief court administrator, declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the suit and the EEOC's intervention.
He said 0 the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 "trial referees," who *T*-1 are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench.
ORGANIZED CRIME Strike Forces likely *PRO*-2 to be abolished *-1 next month.
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's plan *PRO* to dissolve the 14 regional organized - crime strike forces is expected *-1 to go into effect next month, despite the opposition of Democratic congressional leaders and lawyers in the special units.
The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys' offices and focus exclusively on *PRO* prosecuting organized - crime cases.
In February, Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan *PRO* to abolish the units.
He says 0 the strike - force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys.
Mr. Thornburgh will be free *PRO*-1 to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $479 million *U* appropriation for federal law - enforcement and drug - interdiction agencies, according to David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman.
The bill is expected *-1 to pass in Congress next month.
Congress temporarily halted Mr. Thornburgh's effort with an appropriation resolution that *T*-1 prohibited him from *PRO*-2 using budgeted funds *PRO*-3 to implement his plan.
Opponents say 0 Mr. Thornburgh's plan will needlessly break up longtime, tightly knit crime - fighting units that *T*-1 have successfully prosecuted major organized - crime figures.
They predict that organized - crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved *-1 and their responsibilities transferred *-3 to U.S. attorneys' offices.
Some former strike - force personnel say 0 the units have already begun *-1 to break up.
The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled *-1 by the proposed reorganization, says 0 *T*-3 Laura A. Brevetti, who *T*-2 left the strike force *PRO*-4 to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein, a New York law firm.
"Those who *T*-1 have left have expressed an opinion that the strike force should continue," Ms. Brevetti says *T*-2.
But Mr. Runkel contends 0 there has been no exodus of strike - force lawyers.
He says 0 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired *-1 since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan.
At the time 0 the plan was announced *-1 *T*-2, there were 135 lawyers.
Some congressional leaders intend *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 to fight for independent strike forces.
A spokesman for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D., Mass .) says 0 Mr. Thornburgh would be required *-2 *PRO*-3 to reinstate the units next year if an proposed omnibus crime bill is passed *-1.
Among other things, the bill calls for a reorganization of the Justice Department.
The Senate is expected *-1 to consider the bill shortly, says 0 *T*-2 the senator's spokesman.
Mr. Runkel says 0 he doubts 0 Mr. Kennedy can muster enough congressional support *PRO* to reorganize the Justice Department.
"We will vigorously oppose the bill," he says *T*-1.
"I don't think 0 (the reorganization is) going *-1 to happen."
WHITMAN & RANSOM recruits lawyers from disbanding firm:
The 204 - lawyer New York firm will bring in at least 12 partners and a not yet determined number of associates from Golenbock & Barell, which *T*-1 will dissolve Dec. 31.
Golenbock, with 35 lawyers, has lost several partners during the past year.
Some Golenbock lawyers won't be invited *-1 *-2 *PRO*-3 to join Whitman & Ransom, according to partners at both firms.
Whitman & Ransom managing partner Maged F. Riad said 0 the Golenbock recruits will enhance the firm's corporate and litigation departments.
SHORT SKIRTS not welcome in Texas court:
Shelly Hancock, a male county court judge in Houston, refused *PRO*-1 to let a woman plead guilty to a drunk - driving charge because her skirt stopped three inches above her knees.
The woman appeared in court Thursday *PRO*-3 to enter her plea, but when she started *-4 to approach the bench *T*-2, she was stopped *-1 by Judge Hancock.
He told the woman's lawyer, Victor Blaine, that the short skirt was inappropriate for a court appearance.
Despite Mr. Blaine's protests, the judge rescheduled her case for Nov. 27.
Kelly Siegler, an assistant district attorney who *T*-1 was in the courtroom, disputed suggestions 0 the action was sexist, *PRO*-2 saying 0 she had seen Judge Hancock turn away male defendants dressed * in shorts, tank tops or muscle shirts "many times."
Judge Hancock didn't return phone calls.
Oh, that terrible Mr. Ortega.
Just when American liberalism had pulled the arms plug on the Contras and their friend Ronald Reagan *T*-3, along comes *T*-2 Mr. Ortega in Costa Rica this weekend *PRO*-5 to "blunder" into the hands of what *T*-1 are often called *-4 *PRO*-6 conservatives.
Conservatives are the faction in U.S. politics which *T*-1 always said that Mr. Ortega and his friends don't want *PRO*-2 to hold an election in Nicaragua.
Liberals are the faction that *T*-1 says, *PRO* Give peace a chance; now they are saying 0 Mr. Ortega should give them a break, lest the conservatives ask them *PRO*-2 to vote for bullets instead of bandages.
We suspect 0 Daniel Ortega knows the difference between a blunder and a strategy.
He knows that *PRO* making George Bush look silly in a photograph with him will trigger Noriegan fulminations, and that *PRO* announcing an end to the liberals' cease - fire will produce mainly their concern over the Contras' military activities in northern Nicaragua.
Mr. Ortega understands better than those who *T*-1 worry about his behavior that what *T*-2 sustains the Sandinista movement is not democratic peace, but nondemocratic unpeace.
It is the presence of internal and external "enemies" which *T*-1 justifies the need for a large, active army that Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union continues *-3 to supply *T*-2 with bullets.
Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. filed an application *ICH*-1 with Canadian regulators *PRO* to build a 4.4 billion Canadian dollar (US$3.74 billion *U*) pipeline *PRO* to transport natural gas from Canada's Arctic to U.S. markets *PRO* beginning in
The application by Foothills, owned * by Calgary - based Nova Corp. of Alberta and Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, Canada, is expected *-2 to kick off what *T*-1 could be a contentious battle for the right *PRO* to transport vast quantities of gas to southern markets from still - undeveloped fields in Canada's Mackenzie River delta.
"This is a pre-emptive strike by Foothills," said *T*-1 Rick Hillary, natural gas manager of the Calgary - based Independent Petroleum Association of Canada, an industry group.
"Foothills wants *PRO*-1 to make it *EXP*-3 clear to other pipeline companies that it's on first insofar as *PRO* transporting gas from the Arctic to southern markets," Mr. Hillary said *T*-2.
At least two rival applications are expected *-2 to emerge in coming months, including one from TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator.
Another is expected *-3 from a consortium of oil and gas producers who *T*-4 won conditional approval *ICH*-2 this month from Canada's National Energy Board *PRO* to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. *PRO* starting in 1996.
The producers include Shell Canada Ltd., a unit of Royal Dutch / Shell Group; Esso Resources Canada Ltd., a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd., which *T*-1 is 71%-owned by Exxon Corp.; and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd.
"The {National Energy Board} approval of the exports just waved the starting flag for the next stage, the rush *PRO* to build facilities 0 *T*-1 to transport the gas," said *T*-2 Bill Koerner, an analyst with Brady & Berliner, a Washington, D.C., law firm.
Foothills' main rival 0 *T*-2 to build a Mackenzie Delta pipeline is likely *-1 to be TransCanada PipeLines.
The Toronto - based company, together with Tenneco Inc. of Houston, has had an incomplete proposal filed * with Canadian regulators *ICH*-2 since 1984 that it is now updating *T*-1.
Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas consortium plans *PRO*-1 to build a pipeline *ICH*-3 directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's western Arctic with an initial capacity *PRO* to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.
Industry sources said 0 they expect a fierce battle *ICH*-4 to emerge between TransCanada, which *T*-1 has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta, and Nova and Westcoast, which *T*-2 control the pipelines within *RNR*-3 and running west of *RNR*-3 Alberta, respectively.
"This is virgin territory, unclaimed, and it's going *-3 to be nasty," said *T*-4 one observer, who *T*-2 asked *PRO*-5 not to be named *-1.
"Neither is going *-1 to back down easily."
TransCanada declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the Foothills application.
But last week Gerald Maier, president and chief executive officer of TransCanada, said 0 the company "intends *PRO*-2 to be a party to any transportation system that *T*-1 goes up there" and that it would consider joint ventures with other players *PRO*-3 to ensure 0 it has a role.
A number of issues still need *-2 to be resolved *-1 before Canadian regulators give any project the final go - ahead.
First, the price of natural gas will have *-1 to almost double.
Kent Jesperson, president of Foothills, said 0 the company believes 0 the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$3.25 *U* a thousand cubic feet by 1995, in current dollars, up from a current spot price of about US$1.50 *U*.
Mr. Jesperson's US$3.25 *U* estimate is somewhat below the $3.39 *U* floor price that Calgary - based consulting firm Paul Ziff & Co. recently said 0 *T*-2 would be needed *-1 for Mackenzie delta gas producers to see a return on their investment.
U.S. gas buyers must also decide whether they want *PRO*-2 to enter firm contracts for Mackenzie delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area first, a project that *T*-1 has been on hold for more than a decade.
Robert Pierce, chairman and chief executive of Foothills, said 0 it's too early *PRO* to say whether Alaskan or Mackenzie delta gas would flow to market first.
But Foothills said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to seek regulatory approval *PRO* to build an alternative line, the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward Alaska.
If that option is favored *-1 by gas buyers and regulators, Foothills said 0 it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline.
It's also likely that regulators will try *PRO*-1 to forge some kind of consensus between the *PRO* would - be pipeline builders before *PRO*-1 undertaking any hearings into rival projects.
Douglas Stoneman, vice president of Shell Canada, noted that producers would prefer *PRO*-2 to avoid hearings into competing proposals that *T*-1 would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development.
Interprovincial Pipe Line Co., an oil pipeline operator rumored *PRO* to be mulling a gas pipeline proposal of its own, said 0 that isn't in the cards.
Instead, Richard Haskayne, president and chief executive of Interprovincial's Calgary - based parent, Interhome Energy Inc., said 0 the company would prefer *PRO*-1 to work with other "interested parties" on a joint proposal.
As for Foothills' pre-emptive bid, Mr. Haskayne said, "If they think 0 it gives them some kind of priority position, well, that's their strategy.
Wall Street continued *-1 to buckle under the public outcry against computer - driven program trading.
Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General Electric Co., announced 0 it would stop *-1 doing stock - index arbitrage for its own account, and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether.
At the New York Stock Exchange, which *T*-2 has been buffeted *-1 by complaints from angry individual investors and the exchange's own listed companies, Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. held an emergency meeting with senior partners of some of the Big Board's 49 stock specialist firms.
The specialists, a trader said 0 *?*, were "livid" about Mr. Phelan's recent remarks that sophisticated computer - driven trading strategies are "here *PRO*-2 to stay."
Many investors blame program trading for wild swings in the stock market, including the 190 - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 13.
A specialist is an exchange member designated *PRO* to maintain a fair and orderly market in a specified stock.
Mr. Phelan's meeting with the floor brokers comes as he prepares *PRO*-1 to explain the exchange's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow, according to exchange officials.
A Big Board spokesman would only say, "We're working the problem and looking at the issue and meeting with a broad number of customers and constituents *PRO*-1 to get their views and ideas on the issue."
The program - trading outcry was taken *-1 to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said 0 it and 20 or more of the Big Board's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance *PRO*-3 to complain about the exchange's role in program trading *T*-2.
The decision by Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading.
Merrill has been the fourth - biggest stock - index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year, *PRO*-1 executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades, or about one million shares a day.
Merrill's move is one of the most sweeping program - trading pullbacks of recent days, because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock - index arbitrage trades for customers.
Most Wall Street firms, in *PRO*-1 pulling back, have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts.
Merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers.
Merrill also said 0 it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading, including tough margin--or down - payment--requirements and limits on price moves for program - driven financial futures.
Merrill, in a statement by Chairman William A. Schreyer and President Daniel P. Tully, said 0 index arbitrage "has been clearly identified *-1 in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility," so Merrill won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place.
In stock - index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures and options.
The idea is *PRO* to lock in profits from short - term swings in volatile markets.
Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said 0 it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is *?*.
Other large firms, including Bear, Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co., last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage, but only for the firms' own accounts.
Kidder made an abrupt about - face on program trading yesterday, after a special meeting between the firm's president and chief executive officer, Michael Carpenter, and its senior managers.
Just a week ago, Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder, the most active index - arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year.
Index arbitrage, Mr. Carpenter said 0 *?* last week, doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and Kidder's customers were "sophisticated" enough *PRO* to know that.
But yesterday, Mr. Carpenter said 0 big institutional investors, which he wouldn't identify *T*-2, "told us 0 they wouldn't do business with firms" that *T*-1 continued *-3 to do index arbitrage for their own accounts.
"We were following the trend of our competitors who *T*-1 were under pressure from institutions," he said *T*-2.
Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index - arbitrage trading, and is second only to Morgan Stanley in overall program trading, which *T*-1 includes index arbitrage.
Most of Kidder's program trading is for its own account, according to the New York Stock Exchange.
Kidder denied that GE's chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch, had anything 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with Kidder's decision.
But at least one chief executive said 0 he called Mr. Welch *PRO*-1 to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said 0 they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business.
Kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that GE makes decisions for its Kidder unit.
"Our decision had nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with any pressure 0 Mr. Welch received *T*-2," Mr. Carpenter said *T*-3.
"This was a Kidder Peabody *PRO* stand - alone decision."
A spokeswoman for GE in Fairfield, Conn., said, "Absolutely no one spoke to Jack Welch on this subject" and added, "Anyone who *T*-1 claims 0 they talked to Jack Welch isn't telling the truth."
Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987.
But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about *PRO* pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark.
Merrill said 0 it continues *-1 to believe that "the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.
Indeed, there are legitimate hedging strategies used * by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that *T*-1 involve program trading as a means of *PRO* protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries."
Merrill's index arbitragers will continue *-1 to do other kinds of computer - assisted program trading, so there probably won't be any layoffs at the firm, people familiar with Merrill's program operation said 0 *T*-2.
Meanwhile, Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said 0 his firm will continue stock - index arbitrage for its clients.
At the firm's annual meeting last night, he told shareholders that index arbitrage won't go away, despite the public outcry.
"If they think 0 they are going *-2 to stop index arbitrage by *PRO*-3 causing a few Wall Street firms to quit, they are crazy," Mr. Greenberg said *T*-1.
"It's not going *-1 to stop it at all."
Mr. Greenberg, *PRO*-1 noting that stock - index arbitrage rises and ebbs with stock market's volatility, said that for the first four months of the firm's fiscal year beginning in July, stock - index arbitrage had been a "*PRO* break - even" proposition for Bear Stearns.
In response to a shareholder's suggestion, Mr. Greenberg agreed that European firms will simply pick up the index - arbitrage business left * behind by U.S. institutions.
Pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for Wall Street's program - trading pullback.
And there was speculation *ICH*-2 yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual - fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in *PRO* cutting off trading business to securities firms that *T*-1 do program trading.
A Fidelity spokesman in Boston denied the speculation, *PRO*-1 saying 0 the program - trading issue was more of a regulatory problem.
But a much smaller mutual fund company, the USAA Investment Management Co. unit of USAA, San Antonio, Texas, said 0 it informed nine national brokerage firms 0 it will cease business with them unless they stop index - arbitrage trading.
USAA, with 400,000 mutual fund accounts, manages more than $10 billion *U*, $2 billion *U* of which *T*-1 is in the stock market.
Michael J.C. Roth, USAA executive vice president, called program trading "*PRO*-1 mindless."
He said 0 there is "no valid investment reason" 0 for stock - index futures to exist *T*-1.
A program - bashing move is clearly on.
Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel, who *T*-2 is helping organize the alliance of Big Board - listed firms, said 0 he had no time 0 *PRO* to work *T*-3 yesterday because he received so many phone calls, faxes and letters supporting his view that the Big Board has been turned *-1 into a "gambling casino" by program traders.
"We are reaching the moment of truth" on Wall Street, said 0 *T*-1 Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance.
"{Wall Street} is beginning *-1 to realize--as Shakespeare said--0 the trouble is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

Warner Communications Inc. and Sony Corp. resumed settlement talks on their legal battle over Hollywood producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters, but continued *-1 to level strong accusations at each other in legal documents.
Warner has filed a $1 billion *U* breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber - Peters duo, who *T*-1 in turn are countersuing Warner for *PRO*-3 trying *PRO*-2 to interfere in Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued * at over $5 billion *U*.
Although settlement talks had been dropped *-1, attorneys for the two sides apparently began *-5 talking again yesterday in an attempt *PRO* to settle the matter before Thursday, when a judge is expected *-3 to rule on Warner's request for an injunction that *T*-2 would block the two producers from *PRO*-6 taking over the management of Columbia *T*-4.
Yesterday, in documents filed * in connection with that case, Warner accused Sony officials of *PRO*-2 falsely claiming that they never read the five - year contract requiring the two producers *PRO*-4 to make movies exclusively for Columbia, *PRO*-3 citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made * by Sony that *T*-1 described the contracts.
Warner was referring to documents filed * last week in which Sony Corp. of America Vice Chairman Michael Schulof and Walter Yetnikoff, president of its CBS Records unit, said 0 they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that *PRO* getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement *T*-2 *T*-1.
Wayne Smith, an attorney at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Los Angeles representing Sony, said 0 the Sony executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them 0 Warner would let them terminate it at any time."
Mr. Smith said 0 statements about the contract made * in SEC filings were made *-1 by attorneys who *T*-2 did have access to the contracts but who *T*-3 weren't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo.
Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims *ICH*-2 by Messrs. Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that *T*-1 enabled the producers *PRO*-3 to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity *PRO* to run a major studio come up.
But Mr. Smith said 0 Sony intends *PRO*-1 to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist, and that even the existing written contract doesn't preclude the producers from *PRO*-2 taking executive posts at another studio.
Warner described as "nonsense" yesterday Sony's assertions *ICH*-1 in prior court filings that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while *PRO*-2 still fulfilling their contract *PRO* to produce movies for Warner.
Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical," Warner said 0 *T*-1, *PRO*-2 adding, "that concept is as silly as *PRO* suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants."
Warner, which *T*-2 is in the process of *PRO* being acquired *-1 by New York - based Time Warner Inc., also said 0 it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $3 million *U*.
Fletcher Challenge Ltd. said 0 its Petrocorp unit agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire certain Alberta oil and gas interests from Amoco Corp.'s Canadian unit, for about 130 million Canadian dollars (US$110.6 million *U*).
Fletcher Challenge, a big New Zealand - based forest products concern with forestry operations in Canada, said 0 the assets include stakes in four natural gas fields and one oil field near Provost, Alberta, plus gas processing facilities and about 247,000 acres of undeveloped land.
The proposed purchase requires approval from Investment Canada, which *T*-1 monitors large foreign investments in Canada.
Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., which *T*-1 operates the major properties included * in the asset package, said 0 the sale is part of a plan *PRO* to streamline its assets.
Petrocorp, a New Zealand - based oil and gas producer, said 0 the planned purchase would be its first oil and gas acquisition outside its home country, and would form the basis for a new *PRO* stand - alone exploration and production unit in Canada.
If Japanese companies are so efficient, why does Kawasaki - Rikuso Transportation Co. sometimes need a week just *PRO*-3 to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to Osaka *T*-1 *T*-2?
Why, until last spring, did the Long - Term Credit Bank of Japan sometimes take several days *PRO*-2 to correct typographical errors in its paper work for international transactions *T*-1?
Because the companies have lacked office computers considered *PRO* standard equipment in the U.S. and Western Europe, Japanese corporations' reputation as hi - tech powerhouses is only half right.
Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie, but their offices, with rows of clerks hunched * over ledgers and abacuses, are more like scenes from a Dickens novel.
Now, the personal - computer revolution is finally reaching Japan.
Kawasaki - Rikuso, a freight company, set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year's profit *PRO*-1 to more than double the computer terminals at its main office.
In April, the Long - Term Credit Bank linked its computers in Tokyo with its three American offices.
Overall, PC sales in Japan in the first half of 1989 were 34% higher than in the year - earlier period.
Combined PC and work - station use in Japan will jump as much as 25% annually over the next five years, according to some analysts, compared with about 10% in the U.S. .
And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure *PRO* to improve efficiency, more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice.
"We have too many people in our home offices," says *T*-1 Yoshio Hatakeyama, the president of the Japan Management Association.
"Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low."
With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries--from heavy industry to securities firms--increasing their market share world - wide, the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners.
But it also offers opportunities; Americans are well poised *PRO*-1 to supply the weapons.
Japan may be a tough market 0 for outsiders to penetrate *T*-1, and the U.S. is hopelessly behind Japan in certain technologies.
But for now, at least, Americans are far better at *PRO* making PCs and the software that *T*-1 runs them.
After years of *PRO* talking about *PRO* selling in Japan, more and more U.S. companies are seriously pouring in.
Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year.
Lotus Development Corp. has slashed the lag between U.S. and Japan product introductions to six months from three years.
Ungermann - Bass Inc. has a bigger share of the computer - network market in Japan than at home.
But the Japanese have *-1 to go a long way *PRO*-2 to catch up.
Typical is *T*-1 one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau--the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry.
"Personal Computer" yearbooks are lined *-1 up on nearly every desk, and dog - eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks.
But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits *T*-1 only one real - life PC.
While American PC sales have averaged roughly 25% annual growth since 1984 and West European sales a whopping 40%, Japanese sales were flat for most of that time.
Japanese office workers use PCs at half the rate of their European counterparts and one - third that of the Americans.
Moreover, Japanese offices tend *-1 to use computers less efficiently than American offices do *?*.
In the U.S., PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network.
In Japan, many desktop terminals are limited to one function and can't communicate with other machines.
The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co., for example, has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers, a respectable ratio.
But the machines aren't on employees' desks; they ring the perimeter of the large office.
Some machines make charts for presentations.
Others analyze the data.
*PRO*-1 To transfer information from one to the other, employees make printouts and enter the data manually.
*PRO*-1 To transmit charts to branch offices, they use a fax machine.
Meanwhile, a woman sitting next to a new Fujitsu terminal writes stock - market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator.
In an efficient setup, the same PC could perform all those tasks.
In the U.S., more than half the PC software sold * is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis, according to Lotus.
In Japan, those functions account for only about a third of the software market.
Machines dedicated * solely to word processing, which *T*-1 have all but disappeared in the U.S., are still more common *ICH*-2 in Japan than PCs.
In the U.S., one - fifth of the office PCs are hooked *-1 up to some sort of network.
In Japan, about 1% are linked *-1.
"Computers here are used *-3 for data gathering," says *T*-2 Roger J. Boisvert, who *T*-1 manages the integrated - technologies group in McKinsey & Co.'s Tokyo office.
Some Japanese operations, such as securities - trading rooms, may be ahead of their American counterparts, he says 0 *?*, but "basically, there's little analysis done * on computers in Japan."
Of course, *PRO* simply buying computers doesn't always solve problems, and many American companies have erred by *PRO*-2 purchasing technology 0 they didn't understand *T*-1.
But healthy skepticism is only a small reason for Japan's PC lag.
Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand.
Because the Japanese "alphabet" is so huge, Japan has no history of typewriter use, and so "keyboard allergy," especially among older workers, remains a common affliction.
"I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery," says *T*-1 Matsuo Toshimitsu, a 66 - year - old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines, *PRO*-2 explaining his reluctance before *PRO* accepting a terminal in his office this summer.
While most American employees have their own private space, Japanese "salarymen" usually share large, common tables and rely heavily on old - fashioned personal contact.
Top Japanese executives often make decisions based * on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations.
And Japan's management system makes it *EXP*-1 hard *PRO* to impose a single, integrated computer system corporatewide.
Besides, a computer processing the Japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability, while the screen and printer need far better definition *PRO*-1 to depict accurately the intricate symbols.
Until recently, much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable.
Some analysts estimate 0 the average PC costs about 50% more *ICH*-2 in Japan than the U.S. .
But the complex language isn't the only reason.
For the past decade, NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near - monopoly power.
With little competition, the computer industry here is inefficient.
The U.S. market, too, is dominated *-1 by a giant, International Business Machines Corp.
But early on, IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting *PRO* to copy it.
Dozens of small companies did, *PRO*-1 swiftly establishing a standard operating system.
That spurs competition and growth, allows users to change and mix brands easily, and increases software firms' incentive *PRO* to write packages because they can be sold *-1 to users of virtually any computer.
If a record industry lacked a common standard, Sony CD owners could listen to a Sony version of Madonna's "Like a Prayer" but not one made * for a Panasonic player.
That is the state of Japan's computer industry.
NEC won't release its code, and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system--all incompatible with each other.
IBM established its standard *PRO*-4 to try *PRO*-1 to stop *-3 falling behind upstart Apple Computer, but NEC was ahead from the start and didn't need *-2 to invite in competitive allies.
Meanwhile, the big players haven't tried *PRO*-1 to copy the NEC standard.
Corporate pride as well as the close ties common among Japanese manufacturers help *PRO*-1 explain why.
Most rivals "have a working relationship with NEC, often through cross-licensing of technology," the Japan Personal Computer Software Association noted 0 *T*-1 recently.
"They hesitate *PRO*-1 to market NEC - compatible machines; NEC disapproves of such machines, and *PRO* marketing one would jeopardize their relationship."
The result, according to many analysts, is higher prices and less innovation.
While tens of thousands of software packages using the IBM standard are available in the U.S., they say 0 only about 8,000 are written *-1 for NEC.
A year ago, Japan's Fair Trade Commission warned NEC about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for *PRO* discouraging retailers from *PRO*-1 discounting.
In Japan, "software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind, because NEC is enjoying a monopoly," complains 0 *T*-1 Kazuhiko Nishi, the president of Ascii Corp., one of Japan's leading PC - magazine publishing and software companies.
"There are no price wars, no competition."
An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis *ICH*-1 on quality and service than they do *?* in the U.S. .
She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies.
But the market is changing.
The government is funding several projects *PRO* to push PC use.
Over the next three years, public schools will get 1.5 million PCs, a 15-fold increase from current levels.
In the private sector, practically every major company is setting explicit goals *PRO* to increase employees' exposure to computers.
Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales offices in Japan have one - tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices do *?* *T*-1; over the next five years, it is aiming for rough parity.
Within a year, Kao Corp., a major cosmetics company, plans *PRO*-1 to eliminate 1,000 clerical jobs by *PRO*-1 putting on a central computer network some work, such as credit reports, currently performed * in 22 separate offices.
By *PRO*-3 increasing the number of PCs 0 it uses *T*-2 from 66 to 1,000, Omron Tateishi Electronics Co., of Kyoto, hopes *PRO*-3 not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the way 0 the company is run *-1 *T*-4.
"Managers have long been those who *T*-1 supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on *-3," a spokesman says *T*-2.
"But new managers will have *-1 to be creators and innovators...and for that purpose it *EXP*-2 is necessary *PRO* to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached *-4 easily, and also shared *-4 *T*-3."
Meanwhile, more computer makers now are competing for the new business.
Seiko Epson Corp., a newcomer to the industry, fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year.
It has won about 15% of the retail PC market.
Sony Corp., which *T*-1 temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago, started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market.
In a country where elbow room is scarce *T*-1, laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry's future growth.
Toshiba Corp. busted *PRO*-2 open that sector this summer with a notebook - sized machine that *T*-1 retails for less than 200,000 yen (under $1,500 *U*)--one of the smallest, cheapest PCs available in the country.
Fujitsu Ltd. is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history--including a 100,000 - guest bash at Tokyo Dome--for its sophisticated sound / graphics FM Towns machine, which it advertises *T*-1 for everything from *PRO* balancing the family checkbook to *PRO* practicing karaoke, bar singing.
Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying *PRO*-1 to band together *PRO*-1 to create some sort of standard.
Two years ago, most of the smaller makers joined under the Microsoft Corp. umbrella *PRO*-1 to adopt a version of the American IBM AT standard.
That hasn't generated much sales, but this summer Microsoft rallied all the major NEC competitors to make their new machines compatible with the IBM OS / 2 standard.
A healthy, coherent Japanese market could also make it *EXP*-2 far easier for Japanese companies to sell overseas, where their share is still minimal *T*-1.
But it could also help American companies, which *T*-1 also are starting *-2 to try *PRO*-3 to open the market.
As with many other goods, the American share of Japan's PC market is far below that in the rest of the world.
U.S. makers have under 10% share, compared with half the market in Europe and 80% at home.
Though no formal trade barriers exist, the Japanese computer industry is difficult 0 for outsiders to enter *T*-1.
"If it were an open market, we would have been in in 1983 or 1984," says *T*-2 Eckhard Pfeiffer, who *T*-1 heads Compaq Computer Corp.'s European and international operations.
His company, without any major effort, sells more machines in China than in Japan.
Although it has opened a New Zealand subsidiary, it is still only "studying" Japan, the only nation that *T*-1 hasn't adopted IBM - oriented specifications.
And because general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan, sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers.
But the Americans are also *PRO* to blame *-1.
They long made little effort here.
IBM, though *PRO*-1 long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business, didn't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did *?*, and that wasn't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard.
Apple didn't introduce a kanji machine--one that *T*-1 handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese--until three years after *PRO* entering the market.
Critics also say 0 American companies charge too much.
Japan's FTC says 0 it is investigating Apple for *PRO*-1 allegedly discouraging retailers from *PRO*-2 discounting.
But the U.S. companies are redoubling their efforts.
Apple recently hired its first Japanese president *ICH*-2, *PRO*-1 luring away an official of Toshiba's European operations, as well as a whole Japanese top - management team.
Earlier this year, it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer.
IBM just last year started *-3 selling its first machine that *T*-1 could run in both Japanese and English and that *T*-2 substantially enhances compatibility with its American products.
"It *EXP*-2 may take five years *PRO* to break even in Japan," says *T*-3 John A. Siniscal, who *T*-1 runs the Asia - Pacific office for McCormack & Dodge, a U.S. software company.
"But it's an enormous business opportunity.
Secretary of State Baker, we read 0 *?*, decided *PRO*-2 to kill a speech that Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going *-4 to give *T*-3 to a student colloquium, the National Collegiate Security Conference.
We keep *-3 wondering what Mr. Gates wanted *PRO*-2 to say *T*-1.
Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev's need for "a stable currency, free and competitive markets, private property and real prices" and other pie - in - the - sky reforms.
Perhaps he'd have called for "a decentralized political and economic system" without a dominant communist party.
Or political arrangements 0 "*PRO* to alleviate the grievances and demands of Soviet ethnic minorities and republics *T*-1."
Why, a Bob Gates might even have said, "Nor are Soviet problems susceptible to rescue from abroad through abundant Western credits."
If Mr. Gates had been allowed *PRO*-1 to say these things, we would now be hearing about "discord" and "disarray" on foreign policy.
Dark hints *ICH*-1 would be raised *-2 that parts of the administration hope 0 Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were *?* when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments *T*-3.
It *EXP*-1's somehow OK for Secretary Baker himself, however, to say all the same things.
In fact, he did *?*; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago.
So far as we can see *?*, there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker, Mr. Quayle, the Mr. Gates 0 we've read *T*-1, or for that matter President Bush.
They all understand point one: Nothing 0 the U.S. can do *T*-1 will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika.
Perhaps Mr. Gates would emphasize more than Mr. Baker the many hurdles 0 the Soviet leader must leap *T*-1 if he is going *-2 to succeed.
But everyone agrees that Mr. Gorbachev's problems result from the failure of his own system.
They can be relieved *-1 only by *PRO* changing that system, not by *PRO* pouring Western money into it.
GATT membership will not matter to Donbas coal miners short of soap, nor will a START treaty make any difference to Ukrainian nationalists.
On the other hand, so long as Mr. Gorbachev is easing his grip on his empire, everyone 0 we've heard *T*-1 agrees that the U.S. can benefit by *PRO*-2 engaging him.
If a deal *ICH*-2 can be made *-1 0 *PRO* to cut the world's Ortegas *PRO*-4 loose from Moscow *T*-3, why not?
We don't expect much good from nuclear - arms control, but conventional - arms talks might demilitarize Eastern Europe.
There's nothing in the least contradictory in all this, and it *EXP*-2 would be nice *PRO* to think that Washington could tolerate a reasonably sophisticated, complex view.
Yet much of the political culture seems *-1 intent on *PRO* castigating the Bush administration for *PRO* not "helping" Mr. Gorbachev.
So every time 0 a Bush official raises a doubt about Mr. Gorbachev *T*-1, the Washington community shouts "Cold War" and "timidity," and an administration spokesman is quickly trotted out *-2 *PRO*-3 to reply, "Mr. Bush wants perestroika to succeed."
Mr. Baker seems *-1 especially sensitive to the Washington ailment known * as Beltway-itis.
Its symptoms include a cold sweat at the sound of debate, clammy hands in the face of congressional criticism, and fainting spells when someone writes the word "controversy *T*-1."
As one unidentified official clearly in the late stages of the disease told the Times: "Baker just felt that there were some lines in the speech that *T*-2 could be misinterpreted and seized *-1 by the press."
In short, the problem is not intra-administration disagreement, but preoccupation with the prospect that perestrokia might fail, and its political opponents will ask "Who *T*-1 lost Gorbachev?"
Mr. Baker may want *PRO*-1 to avoid criticism from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, but as Secretary of State his audience is the entire Free World, not just Congress.
In any case, he's likely *-1 to find that the more he muzzles his colleagues, the more leaks will pop up all around Washington, a lesson once learned * by Henry Kissinger.
*PRO* Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational.
We note that in Rome yesterday Defense Secretary Cheney said that European euphoria over Mr. Gorbachev is starting *-2 to be tempered *-1 by a recognition of "the magnitude of the problems 0 he was trying *PRO*-4 to deal with *T*-3."
It *ICH*-1 is in the Western interest *PRO* to see Mr. Gorbachev succeed.
The odds are against him, as he himself would no doubt tell you.
The ultimate outcome depends on what he does *T*-1, not on what we do *T*-2.
Even if the press is ready *PRO*-1 to seize and misinterpret, these are not very complicated thoughts.
Surely there is someone in the administration, maybe Bob Gates, who *T*-1 could explain them to college students, or even schoolchildren.
Lone Star Technologies Inc. said 0 its Lone Star Steel Co. unit sued it in federal court here, *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to recover an intercompany receivable valued * at a minimum of $23 million *U*.
The lawsuit was filed *-1 by Lone Star Steel's unsecured creditors' committee on behalf of Lone Star Steel, which *T*-2 has been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since June 30.
Lone Star Technologies said 0 it and its subsidiary's creditors agree that the parent company owes the unit money, but they haven't been able *PRO*-1 to reach agreement on the amount.
Judith Elkin, lawyer for the creditors, said 0 the creditors group is challenging certain accounting entries on the parent company's books and estimates that the receivable owed the steel company * could be as much as $40 million *U*.
The Lone Star Steel lawsuit also asks the court *PRO*-2 to rule that Lone Star Technologies is jointly responsible for a $4.5 million *U* Lone Star Steel pension payment that *T*-1 was due, but wasn't paid *-3, in September and that the parent company can't recover the amount from its subsidiary if the parent company makes the payment.
Separately, Lone Star Technologies said 0 the bankruptcy court granted Lone Star Steel an extension until year end on its exclusive period 0 *PRO* to present a reorganization plan *T*-1.
The 120 - day exclusivity period was *-1 to expire yesterday.
Under Chapter 11, a company continues *-1 to operate, but is protected *-1 from creditor lawsuits while it tries *PRO*-2 to work out a plan *PRO* to pay its debt.
Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to Latin America's most populous and deeply indebted country.
On Nov. 15, when Brazilians elect a president for the first time in 29 years *T*-1, the country's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates 0 *PRO* to choose from *T*-2.
The candidates have been crisscrossing this huge country of 145 million people, *PRO*-3 holding rallies and televised debates in hope of *PRO*-4 being elected *-1 to what *T*-2 must be one of the world's most thankless political jobs: *PRO* trying *PRO*-5 to drag Brazil out of its economic and social mess.
"I feel sorry for whoever *T*-1 wins," says *T*-2 a Brazilian diplomat.
Who that winner will be *T*-1 is highly uncertain.
A half - dozen candidates, *PRO*-2 backing policies ranging from Thatcherism to watered - down Marxism, are given *-2 a chance of *PRO* winning.
"Whoever *T*-1 says 0 he knows which of the six *T*-2 will win is out of his mind," says *T*-3 Antonio Britto, a centrist member of Parliament.
The favorite remains Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40 - year - old former governor of the state of Alagoas.
He came out of nowhere *PRO*-2 to grab the lead in opinion polls, probably less *ICH*-3 because of his vague program 0 *T*-1 to "build a new Brazil" than because of his good looks, the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of "maharajahs," or overpaid and underworked civil servants.
But after *PRO*-1 building up a commanding lead, the moderate to conservative Mr. Collor has slipped to about 30% in the polls from a high of about 43% only a few weeks ago.
*PRO* To avoid a runoff, one candidate would have *-2 to win 50% of the vote--a feat that most analysts consider *T*-1 impossible with so many candidates running.
Two left - wing politicians, Socialist Leonel Brizola, a former governor of Rio de Janeiro state, and Marxist - leaning Luis Inacio da Silva, currently are running neck and neck at about 15%, and three other candidates are given *-1 a chance of *PRO* reaching the Dec. 17 runoff election between the two biggest vote - getters: Social Democrat Mario Covas and two conservatives, Paulo Salim Maluf, a former governor of the state of Sao Paulo, and Guilherme Afif Domingos.
The uncertainty is sending shivers through Brazilian financial markets.
The dollar, the best indicator of the country's mood, has skyrocketed on the parallel market, as has gold *?*.
Capital flight is reported *-1 to be strong.
The big question is whether the new president will have the strength and the political support in Congress 0 *PRO* to take steps *PRO*-2 to cure Brazil's economic ills *T*-1.
President Jose Sarney, who *T*-1 took office in 1985 when the man picked * by an electoral college became critically ill *T*-2, appears *-3 to be simply trying *PRO*-4 to avoid hyperinflation.
The unpopular Mr. Sarney, whose task *T*-1 was *PRO* to bring about a smooth transition to democracy after 21 years of military rule, isn't seeking re-election.
What *T*-1 comes out of the ballot box could be crucial in *PRO* determining whether Brazil finally lives up to the potential of the world's eighth largest economy or keeps *-2 living up to its other, less enviable title: that of the developing world's largest debtor, teetering on the brink of hyperinflation, mired in deficits and stagnation, with huge economic inequalities and social discontent boiling under the surface.
If Brazil devises an economic strategy allowing it to resume growth and service debt, this could lead it *PRO*-3 to open up *RNR*-1 and deregulate *RNR*-1 its sheltered economy, analysts say *?*, just as Argentinian President Carlos Saul Menem has been doing even though he was elected *-2 on a populist platform.
"Depending on the president, we could either be a trillion - dollar economy by the end of the century or stay where we are *T*-1," says *T*-2 political scientist Amaury de Souza.
"And where we are *T*-1 is bad."
Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, inflation came to 36% in September alone and is expected *-1 to top 1,000% for the year.
That might have been considered *-1 hyperinflation not long ago, but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200% in July before *PRO*-2 bringing the rate down sharply in August and September.
Still, massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation - adjusted returns of 2% to 3% *U* a month just *PRO*-1 to get investors to hold on to its paper.
About $70 billion *U* is estimated *-2 to be tied up in the short - term money market, which *T*-1 acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government.
By some estimates, Brazil's internal debt, or combined public deficit, could reach 6.5% of its $351 billion *U* gross domestic product.
Much of the money goes into subsidies or *PRO* keeping inefficient state - controlled companies operating.
Among the results is *T*-1 a frequent breakdown of public services.
It *EXP*-1's not uncommon *PRO* to wait three minutes for a dial tone after *PRO*-3 picking up the telephone, and then to be interrupted *-3 by a busy signal before *PRO*-3 finishing dialing the number.
Officials also say 0 a national electricity shortage might not be far off.
Economists, businessmen and some politicians agree that the answer is an orthodox economic austerity program including reduced state spending; *PRO* focusing spending on vital areas such as education, health and welfare; *PRO* turning state companies *PRO*-1 private; *PRO* reforming the tax system, *PRO* raising public service rates *PRO* to match costs; and possibly a temporary wage and price freeze and a devaluation of the cruzado.
Analysts also say 0 it *EXP*-2's inevitable that Brazil will seek *PRO*-3 to renegotiate its $115 billion *U* foreign debt, on which it suspended interest payments *T*-1 last month.
Analysts say, however, that a tough economic program would have *-2 to be accompanied *-1 by measures 0 *T*-3 to shield the poor from its recessionary effects, for instance by *PRO* subsidizing staple food items.
About 80% of Brazil's voters are believed *-1 to live near the poverty level.
Of the three candidates with a serious chance of *PRO* winning, Mr. Collor comes closest to *PRO* advocating the sort of measures that economists say 0 *T*-1 are necessary.
But his inexperience raises doubts that he would have the political power *PRO* to carry them out.
The 67 - year - old Mr. Brizola has been vague about his intentions and often inflammatory in his rhetoric, but analysts say 0 he probably would be pragmatic.
Mr. da Silva, a 43 - year - old former factory worker and labor leader, is the most radical, *PRO*-1 vowing *PRO*-2 to withhold payments on the foreign debt and saying 0 he "wouldn't go around *PRO*-3 putting the country up for sale to the highest bidder."
But despite the differences in what they say *T*-1, according to some analysts here, economic constraints mean 0 the next president may not have many choices about what he does *T*-2.
An ancient red - figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered *-2 backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned *-2 to the Manhattan couple who *T*-1 lost it in a burglary three years ago.
Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew 0 *T*-3 was stolen *-1 *T*-2.
The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who *T*-1 had brought it in for an estimate had returned *PRO*-2 to collect it and was waiting in the hall.
*PRO*-3 To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, *PRO*-2 apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen *-1, agreed *PRO*-2 to release it.
The cup had been insured *-1, and in short order it was given over *-2 to a Chubb & Son representative.
The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home.
A former curator of the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., pleaded guilty in July to *PRO*-1 stealing and selling original signed and dated comic strips, among them 29 Dick Tracy strips by Chester Gould, 77 Prince Valiant Sunday cartoons by Hal Foster, and a dozen Walt Disney animation celluloids, according to Barbara Hammond, the museum's director.
He sold them well below market value *PRO*-2 to raise cash "*PRO*-3 to pay off mounting credit - card debts," incurred * *PRO* to buy presents for his girlfriend, his attorney, Philip Russell, told IFAR 0 *T*-1.
The curator, 27 - year - old Sherman Krisher of Greenwich, Conn., had worked his way up from janitor in seven years at the museum.
The theft was discovered *-1 early this year, soon after Ms. Hammond took her post.
Sentencing was postponed *-1 on Aug. 18, when Mr. Krisher was hospitalized *-2 for depression *T*-3.
His efforts *PRO* to get back the stolen strips had resulted in recovery of just three.
But on Oct. 6, he had reason 0 *PRO* to celebrate *T*-1.
Two days earlier, his attorney met in a Park Avenue law office with a cartoon dealer who *T*-1 expected *-2 to sell 44 of the most important stolen strips to Mr. Russell for $62,800 *U*.
Instead, New York City police seized the stolen goods, and Mr. Krisher avoided jail.
He was sentenced *-1 to 500 hours of community service and restitution to the museum of $45,000 *U*.
Authorities at London's Heathrow Airport are investigating the disappearance of a Paul Gauguin watercolor, "Young Tahitian Woman in a Red Pareo," that *T*-1 has two sketches on its verso (opposite) side.
*PRO*-2 Valued *-1 at $1.3 million *U*, it was part of a four - crate shipment.
The air - waybill number was changed *-1 en route, and paper work showing that the crates had cleared customs was misplaced *-2, so it was a week before three of the four crates could be located *-3 in a bonded warehouse and the Gauguin discovered *-5 *PRO*-6 missing.
Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be "lost."
Chief Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the airport said, "It *EXP*-1 is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid or misrouted *-2."
Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum certainly would agree.
Their museum had purchased an Attic black - figured column krater and shipped it from London.
It was reported *-1 stolen in transit en route to Washington, D.C., in February.
Months later, the Greek vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville, *PRO*-1 having inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi.
Two Mexican college dropouts, not professional art thieves, have been arrested *-1 for a 1985 Christmas Eve burglary from the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
About 140 Mayan, Aztec, Mixtec and Zapotec objects, including some of Mexico's best - known archaeological treasures, were taken *-1.
The government offered a reward for the return of the antiquities, but routine police work led to the recovery.
As it turned out, Carlos Perches Trevino and Ramon Sardina Garcia had hidden the haul in a closet in the Perches family's home for a year.
Then they took the art to Acapulco and began *-1 to trade some of it for cocaine.
Information from an arrested drug trafficker led to the two men and the recovery of almost all the stolen art.
Among other happy news bulletins from the German Democratic Republic, the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts announced that it has recovered "Cemetery in the Snow," a painting by the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.
The artist's melancholy subjects bring high prices on the world market, and the U.S. State Department notified IFAR of the theft in February 1988.
According to a source at the East Europe desk, two previously convicted felons were charged *-1, tried *-1, convicted *-1 and sentenced *-1 to prison terms of four and 12 years.
The precious canvas, cut * from its frame at the time of the theft, was found *-1 in nearby Jena, *PRO*-1 hidden *-2 in the upholstery of an easy chair in the home of the girlfriend of one of the thieves.
No charges were brought *-1 against her.
Trompe l'oeil painting is meant *-1 to fool the eye, but Robert Lawrence Trotter, 35, of Kennett Square, Pa., took his fooling seriously.
He painted one himself in the style of John Haberle and sold it as a 19th - century original to antique dealers in Woodbridge, Conn.
Mr. Trotter's painting showed a wall of wood boards with painted ribbons tacked down in a rectangle; tucked *-2 behind the ribbons were *T*-1 envelopes, folded, faded and crumpled papers and currency.
Mr. Trotter's fake Haberle was offered *-1 at a bargain price of $25,000 *U* with a phony story that it belonged to his wife's late aunt in New Canaan, Conn.
The dealers immediately showed their new acquisition to an expert and came *PRO*-1 to see it as a fake.
They persuaded Mr. Trotter *PRO*-1 to take it back and, with the help of the FBI, taped their conversation with him.
After his arrest, the forger admitted to *PRO*-1 faking and selling other paintings up and down the Eastern seaboard.
Ms. Lowenthal is executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research (IFAR).
Edison Brothers Stores Inc. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to buy 229 Foxmoor women's apparel stores from Foxmoor Specialty Stores Corp., a unit of Dylex Ltd. of Toronto.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Edison said 0 the acquired stores would be integrated *-1 into its current operations.
The Oakland Athletics' four - game sweep over the San Francisco Giants in the World Series may widen already - sizable losses that the ABC network will incur *T*-1 on the current, final year of its baseball contract.
The 1989 Series, disrupted * by a devastating earthquake and diminished * in national interest because both teams came from the San Francisco Bay area, is likely *-2 to end up as the lowest - rated Series of this decade and probably since the event has been broadcast *-1.
The first three games were seen *-1 by an average of only 17% of U.S. homes, a sharp decline from the 23.7% rating for last year's Series.
A final ratings tally from A.C. Nielsen Co. is due today.
The sweep by the A's, whose pitchers and home - run hitters *T*-1 dominated the injury - prone Giants, will only make things worse for ABC, owned * by Capital Cities / ABC Inc.
The network had been expected *-1 to have losses of as much as $20 million *U* on baseball this year.
It *EXP*-2 isn't clear how much those losses may widen *T*-1 because of the short Series.
Had the contest gone a full seven games, ABC could have reaped an extra $10 million *U* in ad sales on the seventh game alone, compared with the ad take 0 it would have received *T*-1 for regular prime - time shows.
ABC had based its budget for baseball on a six - game Series.
A network spokesman wouldn't comment, and ABC Sports officials declined *PRO*-2 to be interviewed *-1.
But some industry executives said 0 ABC, in anticipation of a four - game sweep, limited its losses by *PRO*-2 jacking up the number of commercials 0 it aired *T*-1 in the third and fourth games.
A World Series telecast typically carries 56 30 - second commercials, but by the fourth game ABC was cramming in 60 to 62 ads *PRO*-1 to generate extra revenue.
ABC's baseball experience may be of interest to CBS Inc., which *T*-1 next season takes over the broadcasting of all baseball playoffs in a four - year television contract priced * at $1.06 billion *U*.
CBS Sports President Neal Pilson has conceded only that CBS will have a loss in the first year.
But other industry executives contend 0 the losses could reach $250 million *U* over four years and could go even higher if the World Series end in four - game romps.
The Series typically is among the highest - rated sports events on television.
Last year's series, broadcast * by General Electric Co.'s NBC, was the lowest - rated Series in four years; instead of *PRO* featuring a major East Coast team against a West Coast team, it pitted the Los Angeles Dodgers against the losing Oakland A's.
ABC's hurdle was even higher this year with two teams from the same area.
The Series got off to a lukewarm start Oct. 14 with a 16.2% rating; the next night it drew 17.4% of homes.
Then came the earthquake and a damaging delay of 11 days.
Some people had hoped 0 ABC's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake.
An analyst's opinion to that effect even sent Capital Cities / ABC shares soaring two weeks ago.
But interest instead decreased.
The third game, last Friday night, drew a disappointing 17.5 rating.
Pacific Telesis Group said 0 its Pacific Bell unit sustained property damage of about $45 million to $50 million *U* from the California earthquake earlier this month.
The San Francisco - based telecommunications company said 0 it carries $150 million *U* of earthquake insurance with a $10 million *U* deductible provision.
Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer, told securities analysts in New York that the company expects somewhat slower per - share earnings growth in 1990, although annual growth should return to the traditional figure of about 7% thereafter.
As factors contributing to the temporary slowdown, he cited one - time rate reductions prescribed * by California regulators as a prelude to a new framework that *T*-1 removes profit constraints *T*-2.
He also mentioned increased capital investment by Pacific Bell for network improvements.
Mr. Ginn said 0 the company's cellular operations now serve about 341,000 customers, up 46% from a year ago.
From a reading of the somewhat scant English - language medical literature on RU - 486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around.
This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient *T*-2, *PRO*-3 zapping only 50% to 85% *U* of them depending on which study you read *T*-1 (prostaglandin, *PRO*-4 taken * in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).
By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective.
Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.
It is time - consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots *PRO*-1 to ease them through).
Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects.
Timing is of the essence with RU - 486.
It is most effective *PRO*-2 taken *-3 about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective *T*-1.
That is typically about a three - week window.
So far, all the studies have concluded that RU - 486 is "safe."
But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means 0 "there's been no evidence *ICH*-1 so far of mortality."
No one has researched the long - term effects of RU - 486 on a woman's health or fertility.
The drug seems *-2 to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken *-1.
Some women clearly have no trouble *PRO* eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.
But there are no scientific data on this question.
Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU - 486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported 0 *T*-1 in 1987.
However, Dr. Etienne - Emile Baulieu, the French physician who *T*-488 invented RU - 486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit - test results could not be duplicated *-487 in rats and monkeys.
The drug has a three - dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that *T*-3 has been linked *-1 to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who *T*-2 took it.
All the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves *-2 ineffective *T*-1 not carry the pregnancy to term but undergo a surgical abortion.
A risk of birth defects, a sure source of lawsuits, is one reason 0 the U.S. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of RU - 486 *T*-1.
One might well ask: Why *PRO* bother with this drug at all *T*-1?
Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question.
RU - 486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none *ICH*-3 is needed *-487, or at least not very much *T*-1," said 0 *T*-2 Phillip Stubblefield, president of the National Abortion Federation, at a reproductive health conference in 1986.
Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding, which *T*-1 occurs even if the drug fails *-2 to induce an abortion.
It *EXP*-1 typically takes from eight to 10 years *PRO* to obtain the Food and Drug Administration's approval for a new drug, and the cost of *PRO* testing and marketing a new drug can range from $30 million *U* to $70 million *U*.
The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from *PRO*-1 funding abortion research as part of its $8 million *U* contraceptive program.
But the Population Council, a 37 - year - old, $20 million *U* nonprofit organization that *T*-487 has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU - 486 on a license from its French developer, Roussel - Uclaf, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government.
In the year since the pill went on the French market, the National Organization for Women and its offshoot, former NOW President Eleanor Smeal's Fund for a Feminist Majority, have been trying *PRO*-1 to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into *PRO*-2 getting involved.
(Its scare - tactic prediction: the pill "will be available in the U.S., either legally or illegally, in no more than 2 - 5 years.")
Following the feminist and population - control lead has been *T*-1 a generally bovine press.
A June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance.
"For a woman whose period *T*-487 is late, *PRO* using RU - 486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery," burbles *T*-1 health writer Laura Fraser.
"It also means 0 she will never have *-1 to know whether she had actually been pregnant."
Wrong on all counts, Miss Fraser.
RU - 486 is being administered *-487 in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor.
(Roussel reportedly has every pill marked *-1 and accounted for *-1 *PRO* to make sure 0 none slips into the black market.)
Thus, a woman who *T*-487 used RU - 486 *PRO*-3 to have an abortion would have *-1 to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated *-4) and *PRO* to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered * either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later *PRO* to make sure 0 she has completely aborted.
Furthermore, because timing is so critical with RU - 486, she will learn, via a pelvic examination and ultrasound, not only that she is pregnant, but just how pregnant she is *T*-1.
No doctor who *T*-1 fears malpractice liability would likely expose a non-pregnant patient to the risk of hemorrhaging.
Many women may even see the dead embryo 0 they have expelled *T*-1, a sight 0 the surgical - abortion industry typically spares them *T*-2.
At seven weeks, an embryo is about three - fourths of an inch long and recognizably human.
At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress, a four - year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family - planning assistance now contains a $10 million *U* grant for "development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods."
If this passes--a Senate version has already been cleared *-1 for a floor vote that *T*-2 is likely early next year--it would put the federal government into the contraceptive marketing business for the first time.
It also could put the government into the RU - 486 business, which *T*-487 would please feminists dismayed * at what they view *T*-488 as pusillanimity in the private - sector drug industry.
We do not know whether RU - 486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility - control methods released * to unblinking, uncritical cheers from educated people who *T*-487 should have known better.
(*PRO* Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth - control pills?)
We will not know until a first generation of female guinea pigs--all of whom *T*-1 will be more than happy *PRO*-2 to volunteer for the job--has put the abortion pill through the clinical test of time.

This article is adapted *-1 from one in the October American Spectator.
It can be hoped that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will draw the right conclusion from his narrow election victory Sunday.
A strong challenge from the far left, the Communist coalition Izquierda Unida, failed *-1 to topple him.
He should consider his victory a mandate *PRO* to continue his growth - oriented economic reforms and not a demand that he move further left.
If he follows the correct path, he may be able *PRO*-1 to look back on this election as the high - water mark of far - left opposition.
The far left had some good issues even if it did not have good programs for *PRO* dealing with them.
It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed *-1 to cure *T*-2.
Unemployment still is officially recorded *-1 at 16.5%, the highest rate in Europe, although actual joblessness may be lower.
Housing is scarce and public services--the court system, schools, mail service, telephone network and the highways--are in disgraceful condition.
Large pockets of poverty still exist.
The left also is critical of the style of the Socialist government--a remarkable parallel to the situation in Britain.
Mr. Gonzalez and his colleagues, particularly the finance minister, Carlos Solchaga, are charged *-1 with *PRO*-4 having abandoned their socialist principles and with *PRO*-4 having become arrogant elitists who *T*-2 refuse even *PRO*-3 to go on television (controlled * by the state) *PRO*-5 to face their accusers.
In response to this, the Socialist prime minister has simply cited his free - market accomplishments.
They are very considerable: Since 1986, when Spain joined the European Community *T*-1, its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6%--the fastest in the EC.
In that time more than 1.2 million jobs have been created *-1 and the official jobless rate has been pushed *-2 below 17% from 21%.
A 14% inflation rate dropped below 5%.
Net foreign investment through August this year has been running at a pace of $12.5 billion *U*, about double the year - earlier rate.
Mr. Gonzalez also has split with the left in *PRO*-1 reaffirming Spain's NATO commitment and in *PRO*-1 renewing a defense treaty with the U.S. .
Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply - side revolutionary, however.
He did not go as far as he could have *?* in tax reductions; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes.
Yet the best 0 the far - left could do *T*-1 was not enough *PRO* to deter the biggest voting bloc--nearly 40%--from *PRO*-3 endorsing the direction 0 Spain is taking *T*-2.
Now he can go further.
He should do more *PRO*-1 to reduce tax rates on wealth and income, in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher, not lower, revenues.
He could do more *PRO*-1 to cut public subsidies and transfers, thus *PRO*-1 making funds available for public services starved * of money for six years.
The voters delivered Mr. Gonzalez a third mandate for his successes.
They, as well as numerous Latin American and East European countries that *T*-1 hope *PRO*-3 to adopt elements of the Spanish model, are supporting the direction 0 Spain is taking *T*-2.
It *EXP*-1 would be sad for Mr. Gonzalez to abandon them *PRO*-2 to appease his foes.
Private housing starts in Japan were unchanged in September from a year earlier at 144,610 units, the Construction Ministry said 0 *T*-1.
The flat report followed a four - month string of declines.
The down trend was partly the result of tighter credit sparked * by a discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan in May.
The central bank also unexpectedly raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 3.75% Oct. 11 as part of an inflation - fighting move that *T*-1 indirectly increases interest rates charged * on new home construction loans.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that *T*-1 stand as milestones of American business history.)
MAY 1, 1975, SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL May Day for securities houses, which *T*-1 were forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to end 183 years of *PRO* charging fixed commissions.
It scared brokers, but most survived.
It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges.
Despite warnings *ICH*-1 from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry, the SEC in September 1973 said 0 full competition must start May l, 1975.
The timing for change was right.
Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats *PRO*-1 to handle their own trades.
And the industry was rife with brokers trying *PRO*-1 to secure big client orders by *PRO*-2 using kickbacks, gifts, women and junkets.
Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all - out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business, with rate slashes of 35% to 60% *U* below pre-May 1 levels.
Ray Garrett Jr., SEC chairman, said 0 the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected *?*."
Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions didn't stop it.
Longer term, the impact is unclear.
The change prompted the rise of discount brokers and a reduction in securities research firms.
But there are currently more exchange members than in 1975, with the bigger houses gaining a larger share of total commissions.
Commissions, however, account for a smaller share of investment - house business as takeover advisory fees have soared.
Foreign stock markets, with which the U.S. is entwined *-1 *T*-2, also have ended fixed commissions in recent years.
It came in London's "Big Bang" 1986 deregulation; and Toronto's "Little Bang" the same year.
Paris is currently phasing out fixed commissions under its "Le Petit Bang" plan.
MiniScribe Corp., Longmont, Colo., said 0 it introduced a one - inch high, 80 - megabyte hard disk drive that it hopes 0 *T*-1 will prove *-2 popular with makers of high - performance laptop and portable computers.
The troubled disk drive maker aims with the new 3 1/2 - inch disks *PRO*-1 to revive its reputation and sales growth.
MiniScribe said 0 the disk drives have more memory capacity than other disks that size.
MiniScribe said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to begin full volume production of the drives in the U.S. and Singapore in the first quarter next year.
A drive with 120 megabytes of capacity is scheduled *-1 for release during the third quarter of 1990.
MiniScribe has been on the rocks since it disclosed early this year that its earnings reports for 1988 weren't accurate.
After an internal investigation, the company found that senior officials used a variety of schemes *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 to fabricate sales gains, including *PRO* counting shipments of bricks and defective drives as sales.
Annualized interest rates on certain investments as *PRO* reported *-1 by the Federal Reserve Board on a weekly - average basis:
a - Discounted rate.
b - Week ended Wednesday, October 25, 1989 and Wednesday October 18, 1989.
c - Yields, adjusted * for constant maturity.
General Electric Capital Corp.'s Monogram Bank USA acquired a Visa and MasterCard portfolio from Commercial Federal Savings & Loan Association, an Omaha, Neb., unit of Commercial Federal Corp. of Omaha.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The portfolio currently includes $95 million *U* in receivables, GE Capital said 0 *T*-1.
GE Capital is a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., which *T*-1 also has broadcasting and electrical - products businesses.
GE Capital said 0 Commercial Federal Savings will continue *-1 to market Visa and MasterCard programs while Monogram provides "operational and marketing support" and actually owns the accounts.
With the acquisition, Monogram, Blue Ash, Ohio, has more than 2.4 million total accounts, GE Capital added 0 *T*-1.
On June 30, a major part of our trade deficit went poof!
No figure juggling; no witchcraft; just vastly improved recording of some of our exports.
The result?
The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated *-1 by $20.9 billion *U* a year and understated *-1 at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion *U* in the first quarter of 1989.
More than half of the "newly found" net exports were from just a few service - sector categories.
Some of the biggest service - industry exporters--American financial - service companies, for example--have yet *-1 to be fully included *-2 in our export statistics.
Nearly 10 years ago, representatives of service - sector companies worked out a plan *ICH*-1 with the Commerce Department *PRO* to improve the data on service - sector exports.
Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports--such as inbound tourism; legal, accounting and other professional services furnished * to foreigners; financial, engineering and construction services; and the like--were not being counted *-1 as exports.
The monthly "trade deficit" figure is limited *-1 to traditional merchandise trade: manufactured goods and raw materials.
In the quarterly balance - of - payments report, those merchandise trade figures are merged *-1 with statistics on exports and imports of services, as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S. .
Over time, through benchmark surveys, the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered *-1.
The first three major areas of the service sector 0 *T*-2 to be revamped *-1 were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. . (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad), some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered * in *PRO* watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine), and improved data from travel and tourism.
In just these three areas, the Commerce Department found $23 billion *U* more exports than *PRO* previously reported *-1 and $11.6 billion *U* more imports, with the net result that the U.S. service surplus in 1988 increased by $11.3 billion *U*, to $19 billion *U*.
Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas, the value of U.S. net exports that *T*-2 had not previously been recorded *-1 was about $20 billion *U* a year.
That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion *U* than to $95 billion *U* in 1988, and $55 billion *U* (annualized *) rather than $80 billion *U* in the first quarter of 1989.
These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar.
The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted *-1 in the market.
What does this mean *T*-1 for trade policy?
Too early *PRO* to tell, but a trade deficit that *T*-1 is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture.
It does not relieve the need for our market - opening efforts for both goods and services, but it does suggest that it is our exports of services, and not just borrowing, that *T*-1 is financing our imports of goods.
Mr. Freeman is an executive vice president of American Express.
Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant, ordered two employees *PRO*-1 to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads.
The killers fled with less than $100 *U*.
*PRO*-1 Describing this and other grisly killings, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C .) recently urged fellow lawmakers *PRO*-2 to revive a broad federal death penalty.
"The ultimate punishment," he declared *?*, "will protect the law - abiding from the vicious, cruel individuals who *T*-1 commit these crimes."
There's just one problem: The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing *T*-1 would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings.
Most murders are state crimes, so any federal capital - punishment law probably would turn out *-1 to be more symbolism than substance.
Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking.
Senate Republicans, after *PRO*-2 repeatedly failing *-1 to attach death - penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full - blown death - penalty bill through committee.
The Democratic leadership agreed *PRO*-1 to allow a floor vote on the issue *ICH*-2 before the end of the year--a debate certain *PRO* to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing.
Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that *T*-1 favors some kind of broad capital - punishment measure.
The pending bill, introduced * by Mr. Thurmond, would revive the long - dormant federal death - penalty laws by *PRO*-1 instituting legal procedures required * by the Supreme Court.
In 1972, the high court swept aside all capital - punishment laws--federal and state alike--as unconstitutional.
But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements.
For instance, juries would have *-1 to consider specific "aggravating" and "mitigating" factors before *PRO*-2 deciding whether *PRO*-3 to condemn someone to death.
Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty.
But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from *PRO*-1 occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug - related homicides.
The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which *T*-1 were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated *T*-2.
Among these crimes are *T*-1 murder on federal land, presidential assassination and espionage.
The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death, including murder for hire.
(Separately, the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who *T*-1 kill Americans abroad.)
Amid the swirl of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue, one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty, on top of existing state laws, would deter any *PRO* would - be criminals.
For one thing, it *EXP*-1's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences, let alone be executed *-2.
Most of the crimes incorporated * in the Thurmond bill *ICH*-2 are exceedingly rare--*PRO* killing a Supreme Court justice, for instance, or deliberately causing a train wreck that *T*-3 results in a death.
In fact, only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years, according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff.
The last federal execution before the Supreme Court's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963, *PRO* meaning that the federal government didn't exercise its execution authority for eight years.
"In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud," argues *T*-1 a Democratic Senate staff member.
"It's distracting attention from serious issues, like how *PRO* to make DEA, FBI and Customs work together" on drug enforcement *T*-1.
Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed *-1 under the Thurmond bill, but they contend 0 that isn't the point.
"Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes," says *T*-1 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur *T*-1, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues 0 *T*-2.
Thomas Boyd, a senior Justice Department official, says 0 the new federal drug - related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far.
In addition to *PRO* resuscitating the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals, this bill has made race a major part of the death - penalty debate.
Before the bill left committee, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass .) attached an amendment that *T*-1 would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown *PRO* to have meted out executions in a racist manner.
The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who *T*-1 complained that it would "kill" capital punishment.
A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion.
And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways.
It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past.
And it would shift the burden *ICH*-1 to prosecutors *PRO* to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities.
"That burden is very difficult, if not impossible, 0 *PRO* to meet *T*-2," says *T*-1 Mr. Boyd.
"How do you prove a negative *T*-1?"
Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able *PRO*-2 to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt, Mr. Boyd explains 0 *T*-1.
At least 15 major studies purport *PRO*-1 to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks, and against black defendants compared with white defendants.
Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research, regardless of its accuracy, isn't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence.
The Kennedy amendment would, in effect, legislate around the Supreme Court ruling.
Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death - penalty appeals, says *T*-1 Richard Burr, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's capital - punishment defense team.
Mr. Kennedy failed *-1 to get his amendment incorporated into last year's anti-drug legislation, and it will be severely attacked *-2 on the Senate floor this time around.
But if it survives, it could prompt other statutory changes, according to the Mr. Burr.
It might force Congress and the states *PRO*-2 to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown *PRO* to be relatively free of racial imbalance--murders by repeat offenders who *T*-1 torture their victims, perhaps.
*PRO* Narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever deterrent effect it now has *T*-1.
And that, in turn, would only strengthen the argument of those who *T*-1 oppose execution under any circumstances.
Part of a Series}
Tom Panelli had a perfectly good reason for *PRO* not using the $300 *U* rowing machine 0 he bought *T*-1 three years ago.
"I ate a bad tuna sandwich, got food poisoning and had *-2 to have a shot in my shoulder *ICH*-4," he says *T*-1, *PRO* making it *EXP*-3 too painful *PRO* to row.
The soreness, he admits 0 *?*, went away about a week after the shot.
Yet the rowing machine hasn't been touched *-1 since, even though he has moved it across the country with him twice.
*PRO*-2 A San Francisco lawyer, Mr. Panelli rowed religiously when he first got the machine *T*-1, but, he complains, 0 it left grease marks on his carpet, "and it was boring.
It's a horrible machine, actually.
I'm ashamed 0 I own the stupid thing."
Mr. Panelli has plenty of company.
Nearly three - fourths of the people who *T*-1 own home exercise equipment don't use it as much as they planned *?*, according to The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey.
The Roper Organization, which *T*-1 conducted the survey, said 0 almost half of the exercise equipment owners found it duller than they expected *?*.
It isn't just exercise gear that *T*-1 isn't getting a good workout.
The fitness craze itself has gone soft, the survey found 0 *T*-1.
Fewer people said 0 they were working up a sweat with such activities as jogging, tennis, swimming and aerobics.
Half of those surveyed * said 0 they simply walk these days for exercise.
That's good news for marketers of walking shoes.
The survey also detected a bit more interest in golf, a positive sign for country clubs and golf club makers.
The survey's findings certainly aren't encouraging for marketers of health - club memberships, tennis rackets and home exercise equipment, but people's good intentions, if not their actions, are keeping sales of some fitness products *PRO*-1 healthy.
For instance, sales of treadmills, exercise bikes, stair climbers and the like are expected *-2 to rise 8% to about $1.52 billion *U* this year, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, which *T*-1 sees the home market as one of the hottest growth areas for the 1990s.
But even that group knows 0 some people don't use their machines as much as they should *?*.
"The first excuse is 0 they don't have enough time," says *T*-1 research director Thomas Doyle.
"The second is 0 they don't have enough discipline."
With more than 15 million exercise bikes sold * in the past five years, he adds 0 *?*, "a lot of garages, basements and attics must be populated *-2 with them."
Still, the average price of such bikes rose last year to $145 *U*.
Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold * at higher prices.
Electronic gimmicks are key.
Premark International Inc., for example, peddles the M8.7sp Electronic Cycling Simulator, a $2,000 *U* stationary cycle.
On a video screen, riders can see 30 different "rides," including urban, mountain and desert scenes, and check how many calories *T*-2 are burned *-1 a minute.
Nancy Igdaloff, who *T*-1 works in corporate payments at Bank of America in San Francisco, may be a good prospect for such a gizmo.
She's trying *PRO*-2 to sell a $150 *U* exercise bike 0 she bought *T*-1 about five years ago for her roommate.
But rather than *PRO*-2 write off home fitness equipment, she traded up: Ms. Igdaloff just paid about $900 *U* for a fancier stationary bike, with a timer, dials showing average and maximum speeds and a comfortable seat that *T*-1 feels almost like a chair.
"I'm using it a lot," she says *T*-1.
"I spent so much money that if I look at it, and I'm not on it, I feel guilty."
The poll points up some inconsistencies between what people say *T*-1 and what they do *T*-2.
A surprising 78% of people said 0 they exercise regularly, up from 73% in 1981.
This conjures up images of a nation full of trim, muscular folks, and suggests 0 couch potatoes are out of season.
Of course, that isn't really the case.
The discrepancy may be because *PRO* asking people about their fitness regime is a bit like *PRO* inquiring about their love life.
They're bound *PRO*-1 to exaggerate.
"People say 0 they swim, and that may mean 0 they've been to the beach this year," says *T*-1 Krys Spain, research specialist for the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
"It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to know if people are responding truthfully.
People are too embarrassed *PRO* to say 0 they haven't done anything."
While she applauds the fact that more Americans are getting up from the television *PRO*-2 to stroll or garden, she says 0 the percentage of Americans who *T*-1 do "real exercise 0 *T*-3 to build the heart" is only 10% to 20% *U*.
So many people *ICH*-2 fudge on answers about exercise, 0 the president's council now uses specific criteria *PRO*-4 to determine what *T*-1 is considered *-3 vigorous: It must produce contractions of large muscle groups, must achieve 60% of maximum aerobic capacity and must be done three or more times a week for a minimum of 20 minutes.
One of the council's goals, set * in 1980, was *PRO* to see more than 60% *U* of adults under 65 years of age getting vigorous exercise by 1990.
That target has been revised *-1 to 30% by the year 2000.
But even that goal may prove *-1 optimistic.
Of 14 activities, the Journal survey found that 12 *T*-1--including bicycling, skiing and swimming--are being done *-4 by fewer Americans *ICH*-2 today than eight years ago.
Time pressures and the ebb of the fitness fad are cited *-1 as reasons for the decline.
Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s--and only slightly.
Jeanette Traverso, a California lawyer, gave up *PRO* running three times a week *PRO*-1 to play a weekly round of golf, *PRO*-1 finding it more social and serene.
It's an activity 0 she feels 0 she can do *T*-1 for life, and by *PRO*-2 pulling a golf cart, she still gets a good workout.
"I'm really wiped out after *PRO*-2 walking five hours," she says *T*-1.
Most people said 0 they exercise both for health and enjoyment.
"If you sit down all the time, you'll go stiff," says *T*-2 Joyce Hagood, a Roxboro, N.C., homemaker who *T*-1 walks several miles a week.
"And it's relaxing.
Sometimes, if you have a headache, you can go out and walk it right off."
Only about a quarter of the respondents said 0 they exercise *PRO*-1 to lose weight.
Slightly more, like Leslie Sherren, a law librarian in San Francisco who *T*-1 attends dance aerobics five times a week, exercise *PRO*-2 to relieve stress.
"*PRO*-2 Working with lawyers," she says *?*, "I need it."
But fully 90% of those polled * felt 0 they didn't need *-1 to belong to a health club.
"They're too crowded, and everybody's showing off," says *T*-1 Joel Bryant, a 22 - year - old student from Pasadena, Calif.
"The guys are being macho, and the girls are walking around in little things.
They're not there *PRO*-1 to work out."
But at least they show up.
Nearly half of those who *T*-1 joined health clubs said 0 they didn't use their membership as often as they planned *?*.
*PRO*-1 Feeling 0 they should devote more time to their families or their jobs, many yuppies are skipping their once - sacred workout.
Even so, the Association of Quality Clubs, a health - club trade group in Boston, says 0 membership revenues will rise about 5% this year from last year's $5 billion *U*.
A spokeswoman adds, however, that the group is considering *PRO*-2 offering "a behavior - modification course, similar to a smoking - cessation program, 0 *T*-3 to teach people ways 0 *PRO* to stay with it *T*-1."
There are die - hard bodies, of course.
The proprietor of Sante West, an aerobics studio in San Francisco's Marina district, which *T*-2 was hit *-1 hard by the earthquake, says, "People were going nuts the minute 0 we opened *T*-4," three days after the quake.
"The emotional aspect is so draining, 0 they needed a good workout."
Perhaps the most disturbing finding is that the bowling alley may be an endangered American institution.
The survey reported 0 the number of people who *T*-1 said 0 they bowl regularly has fallen to just 8% from 17% in 1981.
The American Bowling Congress claims 0 a higher percentage of the public bowls regularly, but concedes 0 its membership has declined this decade.
*PRO*-1 To find out why, the group recently commissioned a study of the past 20 years of bowling - related research.
Three reasons *ICH*-4 were pinpointed *-5: a preference for *PRO* watching bowling and other sports on television rather than actually bowling, dowdy bowling centers, and dissatisfaction with bowling itself.
People who *T*-1 start *-3 bowling *PRO*-3 expecting it to be a pleasurable exercise "have been generally disappointed," the report said *T*-2.
But not Richard Cottrell, a San Francisco cab driver who *T*-1 bowls in two weekly leagues.
He hit the lanes three years ago on the advice of his doctor.
"It's good exercise," he says *T*-1.
"I can't do anything score-wise, but I like meeting the girls."
He says 0 bowling helps him shed pounds, though that effort is sometimes thwarted *-2 by the fact that "when I'm drinking *T*-1, I bowl better."
His Tuesday night team, the Leftovers, is in first place.

After a bad start, Treasury bonds were buoyed *-1 by a late burst of buying *PRO*-1 to end modestly higher.
"The market was pretty dull" for most of the day, said 0 *T*-1 Robert H. Chandross, vice president at Lloyds Bank PLC.
He said 0 some investors were reluctant *PRO*-1 to plunge into the market ahead of several key economic indicators due this week, especially Friday's potentially market - moving employment report.
During the first hour of trading yesterday, prices fell as much as 1/4 point, or down about $2.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
But market activity was energized *-1 as investors started *-2 to view the lower price levels as attractive.
And the Treasury's $17.6 billion *U* auction of short - term bills, which *T*-1 generated strong buying interest, helped *PRO*-2 to lift the bond market out of the doldrums.
"We saw good retail demand by small banks, individuals and institutions and that is one reason why the market advanced" late in the day *T*-2, said 0 *T*-1 Sung Won Sohn, senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis.
He said 0 the change in sentiment also reflected perceptions that the slate of economic statistic due this week will be "conducive to a bond market rally."
The employment report, which *T*-1 will provide the first official measure of the economy's strength in October, is expected *-2 to show smaller gains in the generation of new jobs.
Other key economic indicators due this week include today's release of the September leading indicators index and new - home sales.
Tomorrow, the October purchasing managers report is due and on Thursday comes October chain - store sales.
Despite yesterday's modest bond market gains, economists say 0 investors are anxious about the Treasury's huge quarterly refunding of government debt, the timing of which *T*-1 depends on Congressional efforts *PRO* to raise the debt ceiling.
Although the Treasury will announce details of the November refunding tomorrow, it could be delayed *-1 if Congress and President Bush fail *-2 to increase the Treasury's borrowing capacity.
The debt ceiling is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to fall to $2.8 trillion *U* from $2.87 trillion *U* at midnight tonight.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond rose 1/8 point.
Mortgage - backed securities were up less than 1/8 point and investment - grade corporate bonds were unchanged.
Strong demand for New York City's $813 million *U* general obligation bonds propped up the municipal market.
Traders said 0 most municipal bonds ended 1/2 point higher.
The New York City issue included $757 million *U* of tax - exempt bonds priced * *PRO*-1 to yield between 6.50% to 7.88% *U*, depending on the maturity.
The $56 million *U* of New York's taxable general obligation bonds were priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield between 9.125% to 9.90% *U*.
As *PRO* expected, the longer - term tax - exempt New York bonds had yields nearly as high as those on taxable long - term Treasury bonds.
The yield on the benchmark 30 - year Treasury bond ended yesterday at about 7.92%.
Bond dealers said 0 the rates for the long - term tax - exempt New York City bonds were among the highest, as a percentage of Treasury rates, for any New York City issue in recent memory.
A spokesman for New York City Comptroller Harrison Goldin said 0 the high rates reflect investors concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainties.
New York bonds, which *T*-2 have been hammered *-1 in recent weeks on the pending supply and reports that the city's economy is growing weaker, rose 1/2 point yesterday.
Treasury Securities
Treasury bonds ended slightly higher in light trading.
The benchmark 30 - year bond ended at 102 7/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.92%, compared with Friday's price of 102 2/32 0 *T*-1 to yield 7.93%.
The latest 10 - year notes ended at about 100 16/32 0 *T*-1 to yield 7.90%, compared with 100 11/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.93% on Friday.
Short - term interest rates rose at the government's regular weekly Treasury - bill auction.
The average discount rate on three - month bills was 7.78% and the rate on six - month bills was 7.62%.
Those rates are up from 7.52% and 7.50%, respectively, at last week's auction.
Due to the Treasury's need *PRO* to raise funds quickly before the current authority *PRO* to issue debt expires at midnight tonight, yesterday's auction was structured *-1 differently from previous sales.
The Treasury bills sold * yesterday settle today, rather than the standard settlement day of Thursday.
And because of the early settlement, the three - month bills actually have a 93 - day maturity, and the six - month bills have an 184 - day maturity.
Because of the early settlement, the Federal Reserve was unable *PRO*-1 to purchase bills for its system account.
However, analysts expect the Fed to buy Treasury bills that *T*-2 were auctioned *-1 yesterday in the secondary market.
The Treasury also held a hastily scheduled $2 billion *U* sale of 51 - cash management bills yesterday.
Here are *T*-1 details of yesterday's three - month and six - month bill auction:
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360 - day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365 - day year.
Both issues are dated *-1 Oct. 31.
The 13 - week bills mature Feb. 1, and the 26 - week bills mature May 3, 1990.
Here are *T*-1 details of yesterday's 51 - day cash management bill auction:
Interest rate 8.07%
The bills are dated Oct. 31 and mature Dec. 21, 1989.
Corporate Issues
The junk bond prices of Western Union Corp. tumbled after the company said 0 it won't proceed with an exchange offer to holders of its reset notes.
The Upper Saddle River, N.J., communications firm said 0 it is considering alternatives to the restructuring of the senior secured notes because of changes in the high - yield market.
In June, Western Union was forced *PRO*-2 to reset the interest rate on the senior secured notes due in 1992 to 19 1/4% from 16 1/2%, a move which *T*-1 increased the firm's annual interest payments by $13.8 million *U*.
Although the notes held at a price of 92 to 93 immediately after the reset, they started *-1 falling soon afterward.
Yesterday, Western Union's senior secured reset notes fell 3 3/4 points, or about $37.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, *PRO*-1 to close at 50 1/4.
Other Western Union securities were also lower.
The company's 7.90% sinking fund debentures were quoted *-1 at a bid price of 14 1/4 and an offered price of 30, while the 10 3/4% subordinated debentures of 1997 were being bid for *-2 at 28 and offered *-2 at around 34 3/4.
The 10 3/4% debentures last traded at 35.
High - yield traders said 0 spreads between the bid and offered prices of Western Union junk bonds have been widening for some time, and in certain cases, bids for Western Union securities are not available.
Elsewhere, prices of investment - grade and high - risk, high - yield junk bonds ended unchanged.
In the new - issue market for junk securities, underwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. are expected *-1 to price today a $350 million *U* junk bond offering by Beatrice Co. .
The two - part issue consists of $200 million *U* of senior subordinated reset notes maturing in 1997 and $150 million *U* of subordinated floating rate notes also maturing in 1997.
Portfolio managers said 0 expectations are for the issue to be priced *-1 at a discount with a coupon of 13 3/4% and a yield of about 14%.
The Chicago - based food and consumer goods concern was acquired *-1 in April 1986 in a $6.2 billion *U* leveraged buy - out engineered * by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
Proceeds from the note sale will be used *-1 *PRO* to repay a portion of the bank borrowings used * by Beatrice *PRO* to redeem its $526.3 million *U* principal amount of increasing rate debentures in August.
Meanwhile, underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. are expected today *-1 to price a $350 million *U* high - yield offering by Continental Cablevision Inc.
The senior subordinated debentures maturing in 2004 are targeted *PRO*-2 to be offered *-1 at a yield of between 12 5/8% to 12 3/4% *U*.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities ended 2/32 to 4/32 higher in light trading.
Ginnie Mae's 9% issue for November delivery finished at 98 1/2, up 4/32, and its 10% issue at 102 3/8, up 4/32.
Freddie Mac's 9% issue ended at 97 19/32, up 2/32.
In the derivative market, insurance companies have scaled back their purchases of Remic securities, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, as they assess potential claims from the recent California earthquake and hurricane in the Carolinas.
This could mean diminished issuance of derivative mortgage issues during the next few weeks.
Insurance companies have been major buyers of prepayment - protected planned amortization classes (PACs) during the past few months.
The PACs appeal to insurance companies and other investors because they have higher yields than topgrade corporate bonds and carry the guarantee of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, quasi-federal agencies.
In the asset - backed market, Beneficial Corp. offered $248 million *U* of securities backed * by home - equity loans, the second large deal in the past week.
Last week, a unit of MNC Financial Corp. offered $268 million *U* of home - equity securities.
Both the MNC and Beneficial offering were underwritten *-2 by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the leading Wall Street firm in the home - equity securities market, which *T*-3 was created *-1 early this year.
Municipal Issues
The improved tone in the municipal market, largely an offshoot of the New York City sale's reception, helped municipal futures rebound from early lows, but the spread between the contract and Tbond futures continued *-1 to grow more negative.
The MOB spread, or difference between the municipal and T - bond futures contracts, has been near all - time lows in recent trading, *PRO*-1 driven *-2 basically by concerns that new - issue supply would overwhelm demand.
December municipal futures ended up 11/32 point to 92 - 14, *PRO*-1 having pulled off a morning low of 91 - 23 as cash municipals rebounded.
But front month T - bond futures settled the afternoon session up a slightly greater 13/32 at 99 - 04.
Foreign Bonds
British government bonds ended moderately higher, *PRO*-1 encouraged *-2 by a steadier pound and a rise in British stocks.
The benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003 / 2007 rose 10/32 to 111 14/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.14%, while the Treasury's 12% notes due 1995 rose 7/32 to 103 5/8 *PRO*-2 to yield 11.04%.
West German government bonds fell as much as 0.60 point in light, nervous trading.
The 7% Treasury bond due October 1999 ended off 0.60 point to 99.35 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.09%, while the 6 3/4% notes due 1994 fell 0.35 point to 97.25 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.45%.
Japanese government bonds continued *-1 to erode as the dollar remained resilient against the yen.
Japan's No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended the day on brokers screens at 95.11 *PRO*-1 to yield 5.43%.
Genentech Inc. said 0 the West German distributor of its heart drug TPA reached a joint marketing agreement with a subsidiary of Hoechst AG, which *T*-1 makes the rival anti-clotting agent streptokinase.
The biotechnology concern said 0 the agreement between its longtime West German distributor, Boehringer - Ingleheim's Dr. Karl Thomae G.m.b.H. subsidiary, and Hoechst's Behringwerke subsidiary was an attempt *PRO* to expand the market for blood - clot drugs in general.
A Genentech spokeswoman said 0 the agreement calls for Hoechst to promote TPA for heart patients and streptokinase for other clot - reducing purposes.
It was supposed *-1 to be a routine courtesy call.
A half - dozen Soviet space officials, in Tokyo in July for an exhibit, stopped by *PRO*-1 to see their counterparts at the National Space Development Agency of Japan.
But after a few pleasantries, the Soviets unexpectedly got serious.
The Soviets have a world - leading space program, the guests noted 0 *T*-1.
Wouldn't the Japanese like a piece of it?
The visitors then listed technologies up for sale, including launch services and propulsion hardware.
"We were just surprised," says *T*-1 Tad Inada, NASDA's director for international affairs.
"Shocked."
That Moscow, with its dilapidated economic machine, would try *PRO*-1 to sell high technology to Japan, one of the world's high - tech leaders, sounds like a coals - to - Newcastle notion.
But "the Soviet Union has areas where it isn't behind Japan *T*-1," says *T*-2 Mikhail Shapovalov of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.
"We have obtained through the development of Cosmos {the Soviet space program} technologies 0 you don't see *T*-1 anywhere else."
The sales pitch mightn't be as farfetched as it seems *-1 *?*.
Japan - U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days, and some Japanese favor *PRO*-3 decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter - plane flap, when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused *PRO*-2 to share certain crucial fighter - plane technology *T*-1.
And, despite its image as a technology superpower, Japan has a lot of weaknesses.
It's a world leader in semiconductors, but behind the U.S. in *PRO* making the computers that *T*-1 use those chips.
It's a world leader in auto manufacturing, but its aviation industry is struggling, and its space program is years behind the U.S., the Europeans and the Soviets.
One question being debated * in the Soviet Union is how *PRO* to use the defense sector's research - and - production expertise in the rest of the economy *T*-1.
Many plants that *T*-1 used *-3 to make military equipment are now being ordered *-2 *PRO*-4 to produce televisions, videocassette recorders, small tractors and food - processing machinery.
The Soviets also hope *PRO*-2 to make better use of their considerable expertise in theoretical science, which *T*-1 has helped them win twice as many Nobel science prizes as the Japanese.
Where they lag behind the Japanese *T*-1 is in *PRO* turning the scientific inventiveness into improved production.
By contrast, the Japanese have proved *-1 adept at *PRO* making use of Soviet inventions.
Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system.
Kawasaki Steel Corp. bought a Soviet steel - casting patent two years ago and has jointly developed the system with the Soviets.
In 1991, the Soviets will take a Japanese journalist *ICH*-1 into space, the first Japanese *PRO* to go into orbit.
Soviet efforts *PRO* to sell their technology abroad don't appear *-1 to worry the U.S., Japan's principal ally.
"We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union," says *T*-1 a State Department official.
"Frankly, I wouldn't expect the Japanese to get hooked on anybody's technology, least of all the Soviets."
Under Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, the Soviets have sought economic ties *ICH*-1 all over the world, including new export markets.
They believe 0 technology is one of their best bets, and some Soviet officials say 0 Moscow will even consider *PRO*-1 declassifying military know - how if the price is right.
The Soviets held export exhibitions that *T*-1 included high - tech items in New York and West Germany.
Last week, a Soviet delegation came to Japan *PRO*-1 to push more space technologies.
Japan is a major target for the Soviets.
In August, representatives of Keidanren, Japan's largest business organization, visited Moscow *PRO*-2 to explore exports and investments that *T*-1 would help the Soviet economy.
Out of the blue, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce handed over details on 59 technologies that the Japanese might want *PRO*-1 to buy *T*-2.
These mainly involved such areas as materials--advanced soldering machines, for example--and medical developments derived * from experimentation in space, such as artificial blood vessels.
A main motive is hard cash.
But, while the Soviets can't expect direct technology flow from Japan, they also hope *PRO*-1 to benefit from Japanese manufacturing expertise.
"The Soviet Union has a lot of know - how, but it *EXP*-1 has been difficult *PRO* to put that into actual production because of various structural problems in the economy," says *T*-2 Mr. Shapovalov, the Foreign Ministry official.
The Soviets are "contemplating a flexible system under which it *EXP*-2 would be possible *PRO* to develop {technology} jointly and even to market it jointly *T*-1," he says 0 *T*-3.
Even if the Japanese find Soviet technology desirable, such discussions would be fraught with political complications.
*PRO*-1 Still stinging from the international backlash over the sale two years ago of sensitive military technology to the Soviets by a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp., many Japanese are eager *PRO*-1 to avoid *PRO*-2 appearing *-3 to help the Soviets in any way.
Another hurdle concerns Japan's attempts *PRO* to persuade the Soviet Union *PRO*-1 to relinquish its post-World War II control of four islands north of Japan.
So far, the Soviets have provided only the sketchiest information about their technology and business plans.
And what they have shown *T*-1 isn't impressive.
"My impression is that there isn't anything which *T*-1 arouses our interest at first glance," says *T*-2 an official from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.

President Bush said that three members of his cabinet will lead a presidential mission to Poland *PRO*-2 to gauge how the U.S. can help the new non-Communist government's economic changes *T*-1.

The mission will visit Poland from Nov. 29 to Dec. 2, the White House said 0 *T*-1.
In remarks at a White House ceremony marking Polish Heritage Month, Mr. Bush announced that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole will lead the U.S. group.

In addition, the White House said that Charles Harper, chairman of ConAgra Inc., and John McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., will be among a group of at least 15 business and labor representatives in the presidential mission.
Mr. Bush said 0 the group is *-2 to "focus on economic sectors where U.S. expertise and cooperation can indeed make a difference *T*-1."
Mr. Bush has asked Congress *PRO*-3 to provide more than $400 million *U* in economic aid and food grants for Poland's new government, but has been chided *-1 by Democrats for *PRO*-4 failing *-2 to do more.

Singer Bette Midler won a $400,000 *U* federal court jury verdict against Young & Rubicam in a case that *T*-1 threatens a popular advertising industry practice of *PRO* using "*PRO* sound - alike" performers *PRO* to tout products.
The decision in Los Angeles federal court stems from a 1985 Mercury Sable TV ad that Young & Rubicam worked *T*-1 up for Ford Motor Co.
The ad agency had approached Ms. Midler about appearing, but she declined, *PRO*-2 citing a longstanding policy of *PRO* refusing advertising work.
The agency then turned to a former backup singer for Ms. Midler who *T*-1 appeared in the ad and crooned what *T*-2 was generally considered *-3 a more than credible imitation of Ms. Midler's 1973 hit song "Do You Wanna Dance."
The appeals court held: "When a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known *-3 and is deliberately imitated in order *PRO* to sell a product *T*-2, the sellers have appropriated what *T*-1 is not theirs."
The judge in the jury trial said 0 there was insufficient evidence 0 *PRO* to hold Ford liable in the case *T*-1.
In a statement, Young & Rubicam called the award "*PRO*-1 unfortunate but bearable."
Peter Laird, a Los Angeles lawyer for Ms. Midler, said, "We believe that the verdict reaffirms her position *RNR*-1 and our position *RNR*-1 that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well - known performers.
That is a property right that *T*-1 belongs to the performer."
The award, although *PRO*-2 far less than the $10 million *U*, including punitive damages, that Ms. Midler sought *T*-1, is likely *-2 to force Madison Avenue *PRO*-4 to further rethink how they use famous songs in ads *T*-3.
Last year's appeals court decision, for instance, spawned several suits, reportedly including a recent action by the heirs of singer Bobby Darin against McDonald's Corp. over its "Mac Tonight" TV commercials, a rough parody of Mr. Darin's "Mack the Knife" trademark.
The appeals - court decision last year was particularly surprising because the same court had dismissed a similar case *ICH*-1 in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad--also a Young & Rubicam product.
Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her "These Boots are Made *-1 for Walkin"' song in the ad.
At that time, the court held that such a claim would interfere with federal copyright law, which *T*-1 has always cracked down on the unauthorized copying of songs and musical compositions but never actual performances.
"One thing that *T*-1 is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is *?*.
I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like *T*-1 very much, are proper repositories for *PRO* making distinctions about pop singers," said *T*-2 Richard Kurnit, a New York advertising lawyer.
Nonetheless, Mr. Kurnit said that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect.
"It has made people think twice about how they use music *T*-1 and is forcing them *PRO*-3 to be more circumspect about *PRO* doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form," he said *T*-2.

So - called cross-border acquisitions totaled $23.1 billion *U* in the second quarter, down from $33.6 billion *U* a year earlier, according to the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick.
In a cross-border transaction, the buyer is in a different region of the globe from the target.
Such transactions numbered 670 in the second quarter, up from 527 a year earlier.
However, the total value declined for deals of $100 million and up *U*.
The downturn in total value may be only temporary, suggested 0 *T*-1 Herb Adler, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner.
He explained, in part, that *PRO* restructuring *PRO*-1 to prepare for the Common Market expansion due in 1992 "has become more of a strategic priority, both for companies inside and outside the European Community."
In the second quarter, middle - market cross-border transactions--deals under $100 million *U* each--numbered 619 and totaled $6 billion *U*, compared with 478 such transactions totaling $4.9 billion *U* a year earlier, the firm said 0 *T*-1.
Large cross-border deals numbered 51 and totaled $17.1 billion *U* in the second quarter, the firm added 0 *T*-1.

The Supreme Court agreed *PRO*-1 to decide whether the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. *PRO*-2 to reassume funding responsibility for a $2.3 billion *U* shortfall in the company's pension plans.
The high court's decision, expected * next spring, may affect the stability of many large corporate pension plans that *T*-1 have relied on the availability of pension insurance provided * by the federal pension regulatory and insurance agency.
The agency, which *T*-3 is funded *-1 through insurance premiums from employers, insures pension benefits for some 30 million private - sector workers who *T*-2 take part in single - employer pension plans.
It recently reported assets of $2.4 billion *U* and liabilities of $4 billion *U*.
In its appeal to the high court, the agency said the federal appeals court ruling, which *T*-1 favored LTV, threatened *PRO*-2 to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an "open - ended source of industry bailouts."
The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able *PRO*-2 to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization *T*-1.
LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986.
The filing was partly the result of the $2.3 billion *U* shortfall in LTV's three pension plans operated * for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary's employees.
In January 1987, as LTV Steel continued operating while *PRO*-1 under reorganization, the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans *PRO*-2 to keep its insurance liability from *PRO*-3 increasing.
Termination means that the agency's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed * under the plans, but workers don't accrue new benefits.
A few months later, under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a new program 0 *T*-1 to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans, LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid * under the new pension plans.
But the agency viewed the creation of the new plans as an abuse of federal pension law and an attempt *PRO* to transfer the liability of the $2.3 billion *U* shortfall from LTV to federal insurance.
The agency also concluded that LTV's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization.
In September 1987, it ordered LTV *PRO*-1 to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans.
LTV challenged the order, and a federal district court in New York in June 1988 ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV *PRO*-1 to reassume responsibility for the plans.
In May, a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully.
The appeals court said 0 there was no evidence that Congress intended *PRO*-1 to allow the pension agency to consider a company's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for *PRO* ordering that company *PRO*-2 to reassume liability for old plans.
The appeals court also said 0 the agency had *-1 to consider a company's long - term ability *PRO* to fund pension plans, not just short - term improved financial status.
In Dallas, LTV said that it was disappointed *-1 that the court agreed *PRO*-2 to hear the case because it believes 0 the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings.
The company hasn't been able *PRO*-1 to come up with a reorganization plan, in part, because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency.
But LTV, a steel, aerospace and energy concern, said 0 it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower - court decisions and said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed *-1.

Lawrence M. Gressette Jr., president, was elected *-1 to the additional posts of chairman *RNR*-2 and chief executive officer *RNR*-2 of this utility holding company, effective Feb. 1, 1990.
The 57 - year - old Mr. Gressette, who *T*-1 was also elected *-2 *PRO*-4 chairman *RNR*-3 and chief executive *RNR*-3 of all Scana subsidiaries, succeeds John A. Warren.
Mr. Warren will remain on the company's board.
Arthur Price abruptly quit as president *RNR*-2 and chief executive officer *RNR*-2 of MTM Entertainment Inc., a Los Angeles production company that *T*-1 has fallen on hard times.
Mr. Price, 61 years old, also stepped down from the board of TVS Entertainment PLC, the British TV company that *T*-1 last year bought MTM, producer of such TV programs as "Hill Street Blues" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."
A TVS spokesman said 0 he didn't know Mr. Price's plans.
James Gatward, TVS's chief executive, said in a statement that he will "assume overall responsibility" for MTM's operations until a successor is named *-1.
Industry analysts speculated that Mr. Price's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with Mr. Gatward.
Mr. Price "wanted *PRO*-1 to run the MTM business" and may have regretted *PRO*-1 selling the company to TVS, suggested 0 *T*-2 Charles Denton, managing director of Zenith Productions, a subsidiary of Carlton Communications PLC, London.
Mr. Gatward declined *PRO*-2 to comment, and Mr. Price couldn't be reached *-1 on Friday.
In the TVS statement, Mr. Price said 0 "*PRO* leaving MTM was a very difficult decision," but added that "it is now time for a change...."
The $320 million *U* purchase of MTM represented an audacious international move for TVS, which *T*-1 then was about half the U.S. concern's size.
At the time, Mr. Gatward said 0 his friendship with Mr. Price had smoothed the way for its link with the small British company.
But TVS stunned industry analysts last month by *PRO*-1 disclosing that it expected MTM to post an operating loss for this year.
In that announcement, TVS also said 0 it was trimming production finance and hiring a new U.S. sales manager.
Mr. Gatward has spent a lot of time since late September at MTM's headquarters; he eliminated three departments and fired six executives, according to the TVS spokesman.
Further staff cuts are likely, the spokesman indicated 0 *T*-1.
"Obviously, we are looking at *PRO* making economies across the board."
TVS blames difficulties in *PRO* peddling reruns of MTM shows to U.S. broadcasters for the problems at MTM.
The market for reruns sold * to local U.S. broadcasters has been weak for the past three or four seasons.
Mr. Price co-founded MTM in 1969 with U.S. actress Mary Tyler Moore and Grant Tinker, her then - husband.
Mr. Tinker later left *PRO*-1 to become chairman of National Broadcasting Co.
The TVS spokesman said 0 Mr. Price still holds about an 8% TVS stake, acquired * as part of the MTM acquisition.

Last week the British displayed unusual political immaturity.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters.
The opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. Thatcher for *PRO*-2 having an independent mind and refusing *PRO*-1 to heed the men in her Cabinet.
The British press, *PRO*-2 making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by *PRO*-2 portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who *T*-1 had thrown economic policy into confusion by *PRO*-3 driving a respected figure from her government.
Behind the silly posturing lies *T*-1 a real dispute.
Mr. Lawson and his European - minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied *-1 to the West German mark.
Sir Alan considers this an ill - advised and costly policy.
As there is an effort *PRO* to "anchor the dollar" either to gold or other currencies, the dispute is worth *PRO* examining *-1.
Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied *-1 to the mark.
When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40% *T*-1, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money *PRO*-2 to prevent the pound from *PRO*-3 rising against the mark.
As a result, he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher, through a long and costly effort, had subdued *T*-1.
With inflation surging, the pound began *-1 falling against the mark.
*PRO*-2 To keep the exchange rate pegged *-1, Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%.
This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created *T*-1, *PRO*-2 producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls.
Instead of *PRO*-2 realizing his mistake in *PRO*-3 letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher's political fortune, Mr. Lawson pushed for *PRO* tying the pound formally to the mark by *PRO*-4 entering the European Monetary System, which *T*-1 subordinates all member currencies to German monetary policy.
This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind.
The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that *T*-1 appeal to intellectuals, the media and the imagination, but are full of practical pitfalls.
If the pound had been tied to the mark, the British would have been unable *PRO*-1 to cut their exorbitant tax rates.
The reason is simple.
When a country cuts tax rates *T*-1, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency.
It was fear of *PRO* disturbing EMS exchange - rate relationships that *T*-1 caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about *PRO*-2 cutting tax rates.
Edouard Balladur, the finance minister at the time, was sold *-2 on the tax - cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized *-1 as anti-European for *PRO*-1 disturbing the linked European currency relationship.
The price of *PRO* attracting capital--whether one's own or that of foreigners--is a trade deficit.
*PRO*-1 To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order *PRO*-1 to prevent its rise.
This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit.
Consequently, Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates--three political failures in a row.
Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher's opponents were so anxious *PRO*-1 to keep Mr. Lawson *PRO*-2 in office.
It *EXP*-2 is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought 0 it could prevent a trade deficit by *PRO*-1 inflating the pound.
The British balance - of - payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut *-1 to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion *U* at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.
This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account, a change that *T*-2 could not be prevented *-1 by *PRO* pegging the currency.
Nigel Lawson was a victim of the immense confusion in thought that *T*-1 has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s.
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in *PRO* attracting real capital investment, instead *PRO*-1 emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates.
This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle.
First comes *ICH*-4 monetary expansion *PRO*-2 to drive down the currency's value that *T*-3 was pushed *-1 up by tax - rate reduction.
Then, when the currency falls *T*-1, interest rates are raised *-2 *PRO* to attract financial flows in order *PRO*-3 to stabilize the exchange rate.
This policy is totally mindless, and Sir Alan is correct *PRO*-1 to point out its deficiencies.
Britain and all of Europe need *-1 to reconsider the prospects for European integration in light of the possible reunification and neutralization of Germany.
A unified Germany that *T*-1 remained within the Western alliance would give Germany such an overshadowing position that all other members of a unified Europe would become vassals of the German state.
Unless the Soviet Union collapses, German reunification is likely *-1 to require Germany's neutralization.
The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of *PRO* having their currencies tied *-1 to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate.
In the least, we must recognize the futility of *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to use exchange - rate intervention *PRO*-2 to offset the effects of tax - rate reduction on capital flows.
Mr. Roberts was assistant Treasury secretary under President Reagan.
The rationale for *PRO* responding to your customers' needs faster than the competition can *?* is clear: Your company will benefit in terms of market share, customer satisfaction and profitability.
In fact, managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive variable than ever before.
However, for many, *PRO* managing speed does not come naturally.
"Most of us grew up *PRO*-2 believing in the axioms ` Haste makes waste' and ` *PRO* Don't cut corners,' ideas that *T*-1 seem *-4 to run counter to the concept of *PRO* managing speed," says *T*-3 Dean Cassell, vice president for product integrity at Grumman Corp.
"But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade - off.
Speed is a component of quality--one of the things 0 we must deliver *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to satisfy customers."
Companies that *T*-2 actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead *RNR*-1 and participate in *RNR*-1 teams that *T*-3 increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations.
Managers learn *PRO*-1 to spot opportunities *PRO* to increase customer satisfaction through speed, and shift some responsibility for *PRO* analyzing, improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees.
One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick, Mass., focused on a particularly time - sensitive operation: the morning package sort.
Every morning, tractor - trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston's Logan Airport, *PRO*-1 carrying the day's package load.
In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces.
The packages must be sorted *-1 quickly and distributed *-1 to smaller vans for delivery, so couriers can be on the road by 8:35.
No customer is present at the morning package sort, but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction.
"We're committed *PRO*-2 to deliver the customer's package by a stated time, usually 10:30," notes *T*-3 Glenn Mortimer, a Federal Express courier who *T*-1 led the Natick team.
"The sooner our vans hit the road each morning, the easier it *EXP*-1 is *?* for us to fulfill that obligation."
*PRO*-2 Following a problem - solving formula used * by teams throughout Federal Express, members of the Natick team monitored their morning routine, *PRO*-2 carefully noting where and when the work group's resources were used *-1 effectively *T*-3 and where they were idle, *PRO*-4 waiting for others upstream in the process to send packages their way *T*-5.
"We suspected 0 there was downtime built * into our process.
But we didn't know just where it was *T*-1 until we completed our data gathering," Mr. Mortimer says *T*-2.
"We used the data *PRO*-1 to redesign our sorting system and put our resources where they could do the most good *T*-2."
The team even created a points system 0 *T*-2 to identify those couriers and subgroups that *T*-1 were doing the most 0 *T*-4 to reduce package - sort cycle time.
Winners of the friendly competition earn a steak dinner *ICH*-1 out with their spouses.
"Monitoring shows that the Natick team's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort," reports *T*-1 James Barksdale, chief operating officer at Federal Express.
"The vans leave at least 15 minutes earlier, on average, than they used *-1 to *?*.
And service levels have increased to the point where they're consistently above 99% *T*-1."
A cross-functional team at Union Carbide's Tonawanda, N.Y., facility, which *T*-1 produces air - separation plants, followed a similar path *PRO*-2 to reduce manufacturing cycle time.
"The team included craftsmen from the shop floor as well as engineering, scheduling and purchasing personnel," reports *T*-1 Alan Westendorf, director of quality.
"First, they produced a flowchart detailing the process by which an air - separation plant actually gets built *-2 *T*-1.
Then they identified snags in the process."
The Tonawanda team determined that holdups for inspections were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays *T*-1 involved critical inspections and which *T*-2 were less critical or could be handled *-3 by workers already on the line.
The team then proposed modifications in their work process to management.
"The streamlined manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways," Mr. Westendorf concludes *T*-1.
"First, we have better quality assurance than ever, because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work.
Second, we trimmed more than a month off the time required * *PRO* to deliver a finished product."
At Grumman's Aircraft Systems Division, a cross-functional team reduced the cycle time required * *PRO* to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract.
The team was composed *-1 of representatives from engineering, manufacturing, corporate estimating, flight test, material, quality control, and other departments.
"We needed contributions from all these departments *PRO*-1 to generate the proposal," says *T*-2 Carl Anton, configuration - data manager for Grumman's A - 6 combat aircraft program.
"But instead of *PRO*-5 gathering their input piecemeal, we formed the team, which *T*-2 reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work 0 *T*-4 to guide all the functions that *T*-3 were involved *-1."
*PRO*-1 Armed *-2 with this shared understanding and requisite background information, each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal, *PRO*-1 submitting data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule.
"We cleared up questions and inconsistencies very quickly, because the people who *T*-1 had the skills and perspective required * *PRO* to resolve them were part of the task team," Mr. Anton explains *T*-2.
The team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required * *PRO* to develop comparable proposals.
"The team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate *T*-1.
The result was a more thoughtful, complete and competitive proposal," Mr. Anton concludes *T*-1.
The successes achieved * at Federal Express, Union Carbide and Grumman suggest that *PRO* managing speed may be an underutilized source of competitive advantage.
Managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction.
They effectively lead team efforts *PRO* to reduce cycle time.
And they prepare all their people to increase the speed *RNR*-1 and improve the quality *RNR*-1 of their own work.

Wives May Not Benefit When Men Do Chores *T*-1
WHEN HUSBANDS take on more housework *T*-1, they tend *-2 to substitute for chores done * by the kids rather than by the wife.
Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18.
The women indicated which family member *T*-1 usually did various household chores and the approximate share 0 each did *T*-2.
Not unexpectedly, wives, whether *PRO*-1 working or non-working, did by far the most--about 80% of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two - thirds of housecleaning, *PRO* washing dishes, child care and family paper work.
Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half.
But the researchers found that while children's household tasks eased the mother's burden appreciably, the husband's helping hand "appears *-1 to lighten the children's load almost on a one - for - one basis and to reduce the wife's responsibility only modestly."
This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples.
In these families, husbands took on 80% more chores than in couples with only grammar school education.
But the kids with highly educated parents did 68% less housework than those in less - educated families.
"It *EXP*-1 is clear," Ms. Waite says 0 *?*, "that most of the effect of increasing education has been *PRO*-4 to shift who *T*-2 is helping the wife / mother.
Her share decreases *NOT*, but only slightly."
Nursing Home Patients Apt *PRO*-1 to Be Private Payers
FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents *ICH*-2 bankrupt themselves than *PRO* was previously believed *-1, two recent studies declare 0 *T*-3.
State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own *T*-1 *RNR*-3 or how much income they may keep *T*-2 *RNR*-3 if they want welfare help on medical bills.
Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one - fourth to one - half of all elderly long - term care patients are obliged *-1 *PRO*-2 to spend themselves into poverty before *PRO*-1 qualifying for Medicaid assistance.
But separate reports from Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of the Brookings Institution and Korbin Liu of the Urban Institute find that "a surprisingly small proportion"--only about 10%--of residents start out as private payers but "spend down" to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged *-1.
(Another one - third *ICH*-1 are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes *T*-2, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated *?*.)
But a remarkably high percentage--over half--are private payers throughout their stay, even a fairly lengthy one.
About one - third pay out of their own pockets, while the rest are covered *-1 throughout by Medicare, private insurers or the Veterans Administration.
Both reports are based *-1 on several thousand patients sampled * in a 1985 nationwide government survey.
The Brookings and Urban Institute authors caution, however, that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration, and *PRO* reaching the Medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays.
Moreover, they note 0 *?*, those who *T*-1 manage *PRO*-3 to pay their own way often do so only by *PRO* selling their homes, using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives.
Reagan Era Young Hold Liberal Views
THE REAGAN generation young men and women reaching political maturity during Ronald Reagan's presidency--are firmly liberal on race and gender, according to NORC, the social science research center at the University of Chicago.
Many political analysts have speculated that the Reagan years would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation.
NORC's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults.
But, says 0 *T*-1 chief investigator Tom Smith, this "does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues."
Answers to a dozen questions in the 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were *?* the 18 to 24 year olds in NORC's polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s.
They were also as liberal *RNR*-1 or more liberal *RNR*-1 than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys.
For example, 66% of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an "open housing" law prohibiting homeowners from *PRO*-2 refusing on racial grounds *PRO*-1 to sell to prospective buyers.
That compares with 58% of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys.
*PRO*-1 Asked *-3 whether they agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better *ICH*-2 suited to politics than women, 70% of the Reagan generation disagreed, compared with under 60% of younger men and women in the earlier years.

While Wall Street is retreating from computer - driven program trading, big institutional investors are likely *-1 to continue these strategies at full blast, *PRO*-2 further roiling the stock market, trading executives say 0 *T*-3.
*PRO*-1 Bowing to a mounting public outcry, three more major securities firms--Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Oppenheimer & Co.--announced Friday 0 they would suspend stock - index arbitrage trading for their own accounts.
PaineWebber Group Inc. announced a pullback *ICH*-1 on Thursday from stock - index arbitrage, a controversial program - trading strategy blamed * by many investors for *PRO* encouraging big stock - market swings.
Though the trading halts are offered *-1 as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility, most Wall Street firms remain open *PRO*-2 to handle program trading for customers.
Trading executives privately say that huge stock - index funds, which *T*-1 dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades, will continue *-2 to launch big programs through the stock market.
Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock - index arbitrage clients of Wall Street, trading executives say *T*-1.
These huge stock - index funds build portfolios that *T*-1 match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes, and frequently swap between stocks and futures *PRO*-2 to capture profits.
"They will do it every chance 0 they get *T*-2," said *T*-1 one program - trading executive.
Consequently, abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely *-1 to disappear anytime soon, they say 0 *T*-2.
In fact, without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts, the stock - index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant.
"More customers may come to us now," said *T*-1 James Cayne, president of Bear Stearns Cos.
Executives who *T*-1 manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed * after the 1987 crash.
They noted that studies completed * after the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a source of volatility.
"The issues that *T*-1 are (now) being raised *-3, in classic anti-intellectual fashion, fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies," said *T*-2 Fred Grauer, chairman of Wells Fargo Investment Advisers.
A Bankers Trust spokesman said that the company's investment arm uses stock - index arbitrage *PRO*-1 to enhance investors' returns.
Officials at Mellon Capital were unavailable for comment.
Stock - index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low - cost way 0 *PRO* to match the performance of the stock market as a whole *T*-1.
Many money managers who *T*-501 trade stock actively have trouble *PRO* consistently matching the S&P-500's returns.
Some stock - index funds are huge.
Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, for example, managed $25 billion *U* in stock investments *PRO*-1 tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June, according to Standard & Poor's Corp.
Mr. Grauer said 0 $2 billion *U* of that is used *-1 in active index arbitrage.
Stock - index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool, but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock - index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock - index futures *PRO*-2 to profit from price differences *T*-1.
The 190 - point plunge in the stock market Oct. 13 has heightened concerns about volatility.
And while signs of an economic slowdown, softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market's recent weakness, many investors rushed *PRO*-1 to blame program trading for aggravating market swings.
The Wall Street firms' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors.
Last Tuesday, Kemper Corp.'s Kemper Financial Services Inc. unit said 0 it would no longer trade with firms committed * to stock - index arbitrage, including the three that *T*-1 later suspended stock - index arbitrage trading on Friday.
Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Founders Asset Management Inc. also cut off brokerage firms that *T*-1 engage in program trading.
Though it is still doing stock - index arbitrage trades for customers, Morgan Stanley's trading halt for its own account is likely *-2 to shake up firms such as Kidder, Peabody & Co. that *T*-1 still do such trades for their own account.
Morgan Stanley has consistently been one of the top stock - index arbitrage traders in recent months.
Indeed, Morgan Stanley's president, Richard B. Fisher, said 0 the firm is putting up money 0 *PRO* to form a group of regulators, investors and investment banks *T*-2 *PRO*-1 to find out if stock - index arbitrage artificially induces stock - market volatility.
"We have *-3 to clear up these issues and find out what *ICH*-5 *T*-2 is present that *T*-1 is creating artificial volatility," Mr. Fisher said 0 *T*-4.
"There is no question that investor confidence (in the stock market) is critical."
*PRO*-2 Joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action, Merrill Lynch & Co. recommended program - trading reforms *ICH*-1 late Friday, including higher margins on stock - index futures and greater regulatory coordination.
Separately, Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns said 0 his firm is working with regulators *PRO*-1 to balance margin requirements *PRO*-2 to "enhance stabilization."
Margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash 0 an investor must put up *T*-1 when *PRO*-2 buying a security *T*-3.
Current rules permit investors *PRO*-1 to put up less cash for futures than for stocks.
Some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility.
These rules, they say 0 *?*, permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks, which *T*-1 frequently knocks the two markets out of line.
Stock - index arbitrage, because it sells the more "expensive" market and buys the "cheaper" one, attempts *PRO*-1 to reestablish the link between the stock and futures markets, and the adjustments are often abrupt.
But unequal trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks, which *T*-1 invites frequent bouts of stock - index arbitrage in the first place.
"There has *-1 to be better coordination on a regulatory basis," said *T*-2 Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty - First Securities Corp.
"One agency should have the authority over all equity products.
Pacific First Financial Corp. said 0 it signed a non-binding letter of intent *PRO* to acquire the construction lending unit of Old Stone Bank of California.

Old Stone's construction lending portfolio includes about $250 million *U* in real - estate loans outstanding.

Pacific First owns Pacific First Federal Savings Banks and other financial services firms.
Margaret Thatcher's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is *PRO*-1 to promise business as usual.
That may be the last thing 0 she needs *T*-1.
As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of *PRO* rebuilding confidence in its policies.
The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need *-1 to haul the country through something like a recession *PRO*-1 to bring down inflation and set the economy *PRO*-2 moving again.
Mrs. Thatcher has *-2 to come to terms with European economic integration, beginning with the European Monetary System, which Britain is committed *-1 to *PRO*-4 joining *T*-3 fully someday.
Finally, the government has *-1 to convince a rattled financial community--and voters--0 it is proceeding coherently toward its goals.
It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. Thatcher is expected *-2 to call another national election *T*-1.
What *T*-1's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable.
She could end up *-1 seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation, high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit.
Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today.
"There's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's style of management has become a political liability," says *T*-1 Bill Martin, senior economist at London brokers UBS - Phillips & Drew.
The prime minister's insistence on *PRO* keeping a private coterie of advisers--including an economic guru who *T*-1 openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson--confused the financial community.
Last week, the strategy of *PRO* playing the two experts off each other blew up: Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour.
The confusion could be costly.
Currency traders, suspecting 0 Mr. Major won't defend the pound strenuously, sent the British currency sharply lower *ICH*-1 Friday against the dollar and West German mark.
Analysts expect further jitters this week.
A continuing slide in the pound could force the government *PRO*-1 to push through another rise in the base rate, currently 15%.
That could shove a weak economy into recession.
Economists have been anticipating a slump for months, but they now say 0 it will be deeper and longer than they had thought *?*.
Britain's economy "is developing rapidly toward no - growth," says 0 *T*-1 J. Paul Horne, international economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co. in Paris.
A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991, economists say 0 *?*, while the grueling downturn now expected * could stretch into 1992.
Recovery could be hampered *-1 if Britain's major trading partners in Europe, which *T*-2 are enjoying robust economic activity, cool off as *PRO* expected *-3 in late 1990 and 1991.
That would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver.
For the Tories to win the next election, voters will need *-1 to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand.
Though Mrs. Thatcher doesn't need *-1 to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer *PRO*-2 doing so in late 1991.
"If the economy shows no sign of *PRO* turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable," says *T*-1 John Barnes, a lecturer at the London School of Economics.
There's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community.
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness *PRO* to take part in the exchange - rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which *T*-1 links the major EC currencies.
At a June EC summit, Mrs. Thatcher appeared *-1 to ease her opposition to full EMS membership, *PRO*-1 saying 0 Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements.
Since then, the government has left observers *PRO*-2 wondering if it ever meant *PRO*-1 to join.
Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as "half - baked" in an article being published * in an American economics journal.
That produced little reaction from his boss, *PRO* reinforcing speculation 0 the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for *PRO* avoiding full EMS membership.
Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan, the tug - of - war over the EMS could continue.
Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS, has signaled 0 he will continue *-1 pressing for early membership.
Of immediate concern is *T*-1 whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson's policy of *PRO* tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates *T*-2.
Mrs. Thatcher "doesn't like *PRO*-2 taking orders from foreigners," says 0 *T*-1 Tim Congdon, economist with Gerrard & National Holding PLC.
As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis, many harbor hopes 0 last week's debacle will prompt change.
"We won't have any more of this wayward behavior," says *T*-1 Sir Peter Hordern, a backbench Tory member of Parliament.
"The party is fed up with sackings of good people."
It's an unrealistic expectation.
As long as a decade ago, Mrs. Thatcher declared 0 she didn't want debate in her cabinet; she wanted strong government.
Over the weekend, she said 0 she didn't intend *PRO*-1 to change her style and denied 0 she is authoritarian.
"Nonsense," she told an interviewer *-1 yesterday on London Weekend Television.
"I am staying my own sweet, reasonable self.
Among the things 0 I learned *T*-2 *PRO*-4 covering the World Series these past few weeks is *T*-3 that the Richter scale, which *T*-1 measures earthquakes, isn't like the one in your bathroom.
A quake that *T*-1 measures two on the Richter isn't twice as severe as a "one"--it's 10 times worse.
A "three" is 10 times 10 again, and so on.
That put the "seven" of Oct. 17 in perspective for me.
*PRO*-1 Think 0 I'll buy one of those "I Survived" T - shirts after all.
By Richterian standards, the show that the Oakland Athletics put on *T*-1 Friday and Saturday nights, in *PRO*-2 putting a mercifully swift end to the game's Longest Short Series, rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11.
The boys with the white elephants on their sleeves might not have made the earth move much, but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs.
The Pale Pachyderms propelled six of 'em out of the unfriendly confines of Candlestick Park during the two games en route to 13 - 7 and 9 - 6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.
*PRO*-1 Combined *-2 with their two pre-quake victories, way back on Oct. 14 and 15 (the scores were 5 - 0 and 5 - 1, remember?), that gave them a sweep of the best - of - seven series.
The joke here is that the Giants lost by de fault.
That's geologically correct, but a trifle unfair otherwise.
They showed up, but didn't *RNR*-1--or couldn't *RNR*-1--challenge.
They led for nary an inning in the four games, and managed *PRO*-1 to stir their fans only once.
That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, *PRO*-1 trailing 8 - 2, they scored four times and brought their big heat--Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell--to the plate with one out and a runner on *T*-2.
But Clark flied out to short right field and Mitchell's drive to left was caught *-1 on the warning track by Rickey Henderson as 62,000 sets of lungs exhaled as one.
"I went out to Todd {Burns, the A's reliever} and told him that we weren't gon *-1 na let this guy beat us," said *T*-2 *ICH*-3 Oakland catcher Terry Steinbach of the decisive confrontation with Mitchell, the National League's reigning home - run king.
"I told him *PRO*-2 to make Mitchell reach for everything, and that's what we did *T*-1.
The ball 0 he hit *T*-1 wasn't a strike.
If it had been *?*, he mighta hit it out."
But if the A's hadn't won in four, they would have prevailed in five, or six, or seven.
The best team won this Series, which *T*-1 is more unusual than it may sound *?*.
Baseball ain't football, where the good teams beat up on the bad ones *T*-1.
The best baseball teams win six of 10 games and the worst win four of 10.
Without *PRO*-1 becoming overly contentious, *PRO* allow me to suggest that several recent champions of the world according to us (as in U.S.) might not have ranked No. 1 in many polls.
That list includes last season's champs, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who *T*-1 rode a miracle home run by Kirk Gibson and two faultless pitching performances by Orel Hershiser to a five - game triumph over a bewitched, bothered Oakland crew.
These A's, however, got few grades as low as B on their 1989 report card.
They led the Major Leagues in regular - season wins with 99 and flattened the Toronto Blue Jays four games to one for the American League pennant before *PRO*-1 stomping their cross-bay rivals.
The pithiest testimony to their domination of the just - concluded tournament came from Giants' manager Roger Craig after his team had fallen in Game Three to a five - home - run barrage that *T*-1 tied a 61 - year - old Series record.
*PRO*-2 Asked *-3 what he would do *T*-1 differently on the morrow, Craig allowed that he might play his outfielders deeper, "maybe on the other side of the fence."
The A's offensive showing in the Series got an A, as in awesome.
Their 85 total bases broke a record for a four - game set, and their nine home runs tied one.
Eight Oakland players hit homers, with centerfielder Dave Henderson getting two, both on Friday.
Rickey Henderson, the *PRO* do - everything leadoff man, had nine hits and set or tied four - game Series marks for triples (2) and stolen bases (3).
The sole A 0 *T*-2 not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire, their regular - season leader with 33, and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that *T*-1 stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt.
"*PRO*-5 Think 0 I'll redo my image--get this changed *-4 to a glove," quipped *T*-1 the big first baseman Saturday night, *PRO*-2 fingering the gold bat 0 he wears *T*-3 on a neck chain.
Even with that power show, though, the Oakland Series' star, certified * by the Most Valuable Player award, was a pitcher, Dave Stewart.
He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One, and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12 - day break caused * by the earthquake.
Stewart's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds.
One was that, despite his 62 regular - season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News, he has been overshadowed *-2 by his more - muscular mates and missed out on prizes that *T*-1 might have been his due.
The other is that he's an Oakland native, and lifted residents' spirits by his visits to quake - hit areas last week.
Afterward, as the A's toasted their victory with beer (they dispensed with traditional champagne showers in deference to the quake victims), Stewart said 0 he thought 0 his championship - team ring would outshine his individual trophy.
"*PRO* Give me four or five more Series with these guys, and I don't care if I ever win a Cy Young," he said *T*-1, in reference to baseball's best - pitcher award.
Indeed, the possibility of an A's ring cycle, a / k / a a dynasty, was a major topic of post-game discussion Saturday, so much so that Sandy Alderson, the team's general manager, felt obliged *PRO*-1 to dampen it.
"People change, teams change," he cautioned *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-2's easier *ICH*-1 *PRO* to get worse than better in this game."
He might have added an interesting historical fact: The last Series sweep, by the Cincinnati Reds, came in 1976, which *T*-1 also was the first year of baseball player free agency.
It was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous, "big market" teams to monopolize the best talent, but quite the opposite has occurred: Twelve different clubs have won titles in the 14 seasons since its advent.
The number includes such unstylish burgs as, well, Oakland.
Charles D . Way, president of this restaurant operator, assumed the additional post of chief executive officer.
He succeeds Alvin A. McCall in the position.
Mr. McCall will remain chairman.
Kellwood Co. said 0 it completed a previously announced acquisition of Crowntuft Manufacturing Corp., a New York - based maker of chenille robes and lounge wear.
The apparel maker wouldn't disclose terms of the agreement.
Kellwood said 0 Gabriel Hakim Sr., president of Crowntuft, will continue *-1 to head Crowntuft's management group.
We're sorry *PRO*-1 to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.
He is a politician with the courage of true conviction, as in *PRO* summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%.
But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing, especially if it works as he no doubt intends *?*--by *PRO* forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere *PRO*-1 to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved.
The early omens, we admit 0 *?*, scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome.
The Fleet Street reaction was captured *-1 in the Guardian headline, "Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison."
British politicians divide into two groups of chickens, those with their necks cut *-1 and those screaming 0 the sky is falling.
So far as we can see only two persons *ICH*-1 are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, the counterpoint of the Chancellor's difficulties, who *T*-2 also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher.
The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates, conservative, free - market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps.
There are the strict monetarists, who *T*-1 believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by *PRO*-2 stabilizing the monetary aggregates.
There are the supply - side globalists, who *T*-1 seek *PRO*-2 to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates.
And there are the twin - deficit Keynesians, who *T*-1 predict / advocate devaluations 0 *T*-2 to balance trade flows.
This is a problem not only for Prime Minister Thatcher but for President Bush, as *PRO*-1 shown *-2 in the ongoing bickering over the dollar between the Federal Reserve and the Mulford Treasury.
In the British case, Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply - side globalist.
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, *PRO*-2 initially sparking fresh growth in Britain, but he wanted *PRO*-1 to regulate monetary policy by *PRO*-3 targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System.
While *PRO*-1 no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else, Sir Alan is a dyed - in - the - wool monetarist, inclined *PRO* to defend floating rates to the death.
*PRO* To make matters even more confusing, the earlier U.S. experience made clear that Mr. Lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain's international accounts and the value of sterling.
They increased the after - tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place 0 *PRO* to invest *T*-1, *PRO*-2 producing sudden capital inflows.
By accounting definitions, this had *-1 to produce a sudden trade deficit.
As in the U.S., it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M - Whatever.
At this point, the options were: *PRO* Crunch money *PRO*-1 to stop the boost in the aggregates, as Sir Alan surely advised *?*, and *PRO* forget the soaring pound.
*PRO* To push the pound even lower *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to cure the trade deficit, a policy 0 Britain has repeatedly proved *T*-3 disastrous.
Or *PRO* to supply enough money 0 *T*-1 to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate, as the Chancellor argued *?*, and ensure the permanence of this policy by *PRO*-2 joining the EMS.
*PRO*-1 Faced *-2 with a similar situation, Paul Volcker let the dollar soar, (though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly 0 monetarists issued egg - on - the - face warnings of inflation).
But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, *PRO*-1 laying the seeds of protectionism.
Mr. Lawson, though *PRO*-1 not allowed *PRO*-2 to join the EMS, chose *PRO*-1 to "shadow" the deutsche mark.
He reaped inflation along with rapid growth, no doubt *PRO*-1 validating Sir Alan's predictions in the Prime Minister's mind.
But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which *T*-1 has also seemed *-4 almost impervious to the high interest rates 0 Mr. Lawson deployed *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to stop it.
So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that *T*-1 reaches far beyond the shores of Albion.
We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one - time deputy, John Major.
*PRO*-1 To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses.
In pursuit of this mystery, Keynesian adepts and twin - deficit mavens need not apply.
We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.
Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.
The wage stickiness, which OECD studies confirm 0 *T*-1 is particularly high in Britain, gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation.
Inflation is easier 0 *PRO* to spark *T*-1 and harder 0 *PRO* to control *T*-2.
We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility 0 it lost *T*-1 in the U.S. experience.
Nearby Paul Craig Roberts, a distinguished supply - sider with monetarist sympathies, argues the case for Sir Alan.
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed *-1 by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether *PRO* to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.
We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for *PRO*-2 being too easy because of a desire *PRO* to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise *T*-1.
Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean, perhaps measured * by M - Whatever, but perhaps measured * by purchasing power parity.
The globalists tend *-1 to think 0 Mr. Lawson ran onto technical reefs.
In *PRO* fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial, for example, and perhaps he picked the wrong pound - DM rate.
For that matter, perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency.
We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance *PRO* to tie her currency to one governed * by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany.
Perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low - tax, deregulated, supply - side economy.
Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus.
Those who *T*-1 can shake Keynesian ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open - market operation, indeed, it *EXP*-2 is the definition of an open market operation *PRO* to expand the money supply.
Mr. Reynolds also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements, high interest rates are less likely *PRO*-1 to curb inflation than *PRO*-1 to cause recession.
We would add that in political terms, Mrs. Thatcher's problem was *PRO* failing *-1 to decide between the Chancellor and her adviser.
In the end, neither policy was followed *-1, and instead of *PRO*-2 learning anything we are left *-2 with a mystery.
In particular, *PRO* "shadowing" a currency is anything but fixing; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility.
All the more so when strong voices are heard *PRO*-2 opposing the policy *T*-1.
Better *PRO* to have a true monetarist policy, just for the experience.
So Mr. Lawson had *-1 to resign.
In the end his move was sparked *-1 by remarks in excerpts from Sir Alan's autobiography in The American Economist, a 10,000 - circulation academic journal.
But it was the underlying situation that *T*-1 became intolerable.
What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do *T*-2 now remains *PRO*-3 to be seen *-1.
They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy, that is *PRO* to say *?*, stagflation.
This cannot be solved *-1 by *PRO* provoking a further downturn; *PRO* reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation.
Our advice is this: *PRO* Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive - maximizing tax cuts, and find some monetary policy target that *T*-1 balances both supply and demand for money (which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do *T*-2).
This was the version of supply - side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, *T*-1 worked in America and world - wide *PRO*-2 to solve a far more serious stagflation than *?* afflicts Britain today.
October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost, the official Soviet policy of *PRO* allowing more candor from the nation's media.
For one of the superstars of glasnost, Vitaly Korotich, editor of the trail - blazing weekly Ogonyok, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that *T*-1 turned from tension to elation.
He had been summoned *-1 to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, after he finished his lunch at the Savoy Hotel, an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic brow - beating: Eight - foot - tall Rubenesquely naked ladies float on their canvases toward a ceiling teeming with cherubs, all surrounded * by gilt laid * on with a pastry chef's trowel and supported * by marble corinthian columns whose capitals *T*-2 are fluting fountains of gold.
Why had Mr. Korotich been called *-1 *T*-2?
"I told my driver," he said *?*, "that he was taking my butt to the Central Committee so they can *?* ..." whack, whack, whack his hand made vigorous spanking gestures on his left palm . "
They feel the need *ICH*-2 from time to time *PRO* to ` educate' me."
And indeed, as he later reported, that was the import of the meeting.
Anxious allies of President Mikhail Gorbachev are cautioning media leaders *PRO*-2 to take it easy, to be careful *PRO*-4 not to do anything that *T*-3 could be used *-1 by Mr. Gorbachev's opponents.
The government is nervous.
According to Mr. Korotich, who *T*-1 was present, Mr. Gorbachev's publicized tongue - lashing of the press on Oct. 13 was more of a plea: "*PRO* Be careful boys; *PRO* use good judgment.
We're standing in gasoline, so *PRO* don't smoke!"
U.S. and northern European diplomats confirm Mr. Korotich's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger.
In fact, a very high - ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated *-1.
The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, was replaced *-1 by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev's.
Brezhnevite holdovers have more 0 *PRO* to fear *T*-2 from Mr. Gorbachev than the verbal spanking 0 he gave *T*-1 to the press.
At the end of the very week in which Mr. Korotich was called *-1 to the Central Committee *T*-3, Ogonyok was again demonstrating its independence by *PRO*-4 printing a poll that *T*-2 showed that 35% of the Soviet population, a plurality, believed that Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms, perestroika, would result in only insignificant change.
A good measurement of the popularity of ice - breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation.
When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986 *T*-1, it sold 250,000 copies; today it sells 3.4 million.
Pravda, meanwhile, has retained only 57% of its 1986 readership.
Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich.
*PRO*-2 Prevented *-1 by the Communist Party from *PRO*-3 getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84% of the vote.
The same evening that he was summoned *-1 for a warning from the Party *T*-4, he was cheered *-2 by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what *T*-5 can only be called *-3 *PRO*-6 the Korotich party.
But *PRO* as astounding as the changes that *T*-1 have already occurred are *?*, there is a fragility to glasnost.
Censorship isn't a Marxist invention.
The czars were no civil libertarians.
As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines.
It even directed newspapers *PRO*-2 not to publish anything that *T*-1 might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives.
So glasnost is not a value woven * with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society.
It is an admirable public relations program initiated * by a single political leader during a four - year blink of history.
It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that *T*-2 recognizes that credibility is enhanced *-1 by honesty--up to a point.
What is that point *T*-1?
Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika?
"I'd be destroying myself," replies *T*-3 Mr. Korotich, who *T*-1 then asks, "What would that accomplish *T*-2?
" His answer reveals his vulnerability--it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture.
It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders *T*-1.
Mr. Ayers is editor and publisher of the Anniston, Ala., Star.
When Michael S. Perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event *T*-1, more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention.
Mr. Perry, who *T*-1 runs Unilever Group's world - wide personal - care business, paused *PRO*-2 to scan the crowd.
"I see 0 we have about half the audience working for us," he said *T*-1, tongue in cheek.
"The other half, we may have *T*-1 before long."
Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously; their industry has been unsettled *-1 recently by acquisitions.
First Unilever, the Anglo - Dutch packaged - goods giant, spent $2 billion *U* *PRO*-1 to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden.
It now holds the No. 3 position at U.S. department - store cosmetic counters.
Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Noxell Corp. for $1.3 billion *U*.
That acquisition, 0 *T*-2 to be completed *-1 by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, *PRO*-3 making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass - market outlets.
It's not so much the idea of acquisitions *ICH*-2 that *T*-1 has agitated the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring: P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, *PRO*-3 sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, *PRO* sparking fear.
Though it *EXP*-1 is far from certain that companies best known * for *PRO*-2 selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics, there's little doubt 0 they will shake up the industry.
For now, both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans.
But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies 0 they use *T*-1 for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies.
Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing.
But some cosmetics - industry executives wonder whether techniques honed * in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business.
Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development *T*-2 is guided *-1 by the creative intuition of their executives.
Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied *-1 by competitors, they're loath *PRO*-2 to test them with consumers.
"Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean 0 they are packaged goods," says *T*-1 Leonard Lauder, chief executive of Estee Lauder.
"They're really fashion items wrapped * up in little jars."
In contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray - flannel suits.
Both companies are conservative marketers that *T*-1 rely on extensive market research.
P&G, in particular, rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test - marketing.
Both can be extremely aggressive at *PRO* pricing such products as soaps and diapers--to the extent that some industry consultants predict 0 cents - off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field.
P&G already has shown 0 it can meld some traditional packaged - goods techniques with the image - making of the cosmetics trade in the mass - market end of the business.
*PRO* Consider Oil of Olay, which P&G acquired *T*-1 as part of Richardson - Vicks International in 1985.
The moisturizer, introduced * in 1962, had a dowdy image.
"Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of *PRO* being used *-1 basically by older women who *T*-2 had already aged," says *T*-3 David Williams, a consultant with New England Consulting Group.
P&G set out *PRO*-1 to reposition the brand by *PRO*-3 broadening the product line *PRO*-2 to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.
It also redesigned Oil of Olay's packaging, *PRO*-2 stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines *PRO*-1 to create a more opulent look.
Moreover, P&G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing "*PRO* not to grow old gracefully."
The company says 0 sales have soared.
Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals.
Next year, Noxell plans *PRO*-1 to roll out a perfume called * *PRO*-3 Navy, says *T*-2 George L. Bunting Jr., chairman of Noxell.
Without P&G's backing, Noxell might not have been able *PRO*-1 to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million *U* needed * *PRO* to accomplish that without *PRO*-2 scrimping on its existing brands.
Packaged - goods companies "will make it *EXP*-2 tougher for smaller people to remain competitive," Mr. Bunting says 0 *T*-1.
Further consolidations in the industry could follow.
Rumors that Unilever is interested in *PRO*-1 acquiring Schering - Plough Corp.'s Maybelline unit are widespread.
Unilever won't comment; Schering, however, denies 0 the brand is for sale.
The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely *-1 to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics.
While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads.
Instead, they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that *T*-1 go along with purchases.
Estee Lauder, for example, spends only an estimated 5% of sales on advertising in the U.S., and Mr. Lauder says 0 he has no plans *PRO* to change his strategy.
The most dramatic changes, however, probably will come in new - product development.
Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass - distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
That figure has been inching up for several years.
As the trend continues, demand for mass - market items that *T*-1 are high quality but only mid-priced--particularly skin - care products--is expected *-2 to increase.
This fall, for example, L'Oreal Group, ordinarily a high - end line, rolled out a drug - store line of skin - care products called * *PRO*-2 Plenitude, which *T*-1 retail for $5 to $15 *U*.
The packaged - goods marketers may try *PRO*-1 filling that gap with a spate of new products.
Unlike the old - line cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G both have enormous research and development bases 0 *PRO* to draw on *T*-1 for new products.
P&G, in fact, is noted *-1 for *PRO*-3 gaining market leadership by *PRO*-4 introducing products that *T*-2 offer a technical edge over the competition.
Sales of its Tide detergent soared earlier this year, for example, after P&G introduced a version that *T*-1 includes a bleach safe for all colors and fabrics.
That's led industry executives *PRO*-2 to speculate that future product development will be driven *-1 more by technological innovation than by fashion whims--especially among mass - market brands.
"There will be more emphasis on quality," says *T*-1 Guy Peyrelongue, chief executive of Cosmair Inc., the U.S. licensee of L'Oreal.
"You'll see fewer gimmicks."
But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed, as *PRO* shown *-3 by the many consumer - product companies that *T*-2 have tried and failed *PRO*-4 to master the quirky beauty business.
In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged - goods companies, including Colgate - Palmolive Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Schering - Plough acquired cosmetics companies.
Industry consultants say 0 only Schering - Plough, which *T*-1 makes the mass - market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business.
Colgate, which *T*-1 acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973, sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished.
Unilever already has experienced some disappointment.
The mass - market Aziza brand, which it acquired *T*-1 in 1987 along with Chesebrough - Pond's Inc., has lost share, according to industry analysts.
The ritzy world of department - store cosmetics retailing, where Unilever is concentrating its efforts *T*-1, may prove *-2 even more treacherous.
In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked *-1 to ready - 0 *PRO* to - wear *T*-2 fashions.
Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important.
And *PRO* cultivating a luxury image strong enough *PRO* to persuade consumers *PRO*-1 to pay more than $15 *U* for lipstick or eye makeup requires a subtle touch that packaged - goods companies have yet *-2 to demonstrate *T*-3 on their own.
Personal spending, which *T*-1 fueled the economy's growth in the third quarter, was clearly slowing by the end of the period, *PRO* raising questions about the economy's strength as the year ends.
Personal spending grew 0.2% in September to a $3.526 trillion *U* annual rate, the Commerce Department said 0 *T*-1.
It was the smallest monthly increase in a year.
At the same time, personal income was held *-1 down by the effects of Hurricane Hugo, which *T*-2 tore through parts of North and South Carolina in late September.
The department said 0 personal income rose 0.3% in September to a $4.469 trillion *U* rate but would have climbed 0.6% had it not been for the storm.
Among the economic effects of the hurricane was *T*-1 a sharp drop in rental income.
The figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled U.S. economic expansion in the third quarter while--on an inflation - adjusted basis--business investment slowed, government spending declined, and exports were flat.
But the new statistics show that by September, the burst in spending seemed *-1 to be tapering off.
Many economists expect the weakness to continue.
"I think 0 the consumer has pretty well played himself out," said *T*-1 David Littman, senior economist at Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit.
"I don't think 0 there's a lot in the wings" in other sectors of the economy 0 *T*-1 to keep growth *PRO*-4 above 1%, he said *T*-3.
In the third quarter, the economy grew at a moderate 2.5% annual rate.
In August, personal income rose 0.3% and spending grew 0.9%.
Analysts have attributed much of the summer's spurt in spending to bargain car prices at the end of the model year.
Car sales slackened in September after the 1990 models were introduced *-1.
According to the Commerce Department report, spending on durable goods--items expected *PRO* to last at least three years, including cars--declined by $6.2 billion *U*.
The nation's savings rate was unchanged in September at 4.9% of after - tax income, far below the 5.6% 0 it reached *T*-1 in July.
All the figures are adjusted *-1 for seasonal variations.
Here is *T*-1 the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income.
The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.
American Airlines will expand its trans-Atlantic service 30% beginning next year with six new daily flights between the U.S. and Europe, officials announced 0 *T*-2 yesterday.
American, a unit of AMR Corp., is the nation's largest airline.
The new nonstop flights, starting next May, will include Chicago - Warsaw, Chicago - Helsinki, Miami - Madrid, Dallas - Barcelona, a second daily Chicago - Paris flight and a second daily Chicago - Manchester flight, the officials said 0 *T*-2.
Chicago has the largest population of citizens of Polish heritage in any city outside Poland.
With the new service, American will fly 161 flights a week to 17 European cities.
The additions solidify American's position as the third - largest U.S. transatlantic carrier, behind PanAm Corp.'s Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines.
If this battle were a movie, the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common.
In the opener, Sony Corp. would agree *PRO*-1 to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued * at close to $5 billion *U*.
Shortly after that, Sony would offer *PRO*-1 to buy Guber - Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million *U* and offer its co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the chance *PRO* to run Columbia.
Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of *PRO* telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber - Peters planned *PRO*-1 to end its five - year contract *PRO* to produce movies exclusively for Warner.
That's where the two scripts would diverge *T*-1.
In affidavits filed * in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $1 billion *U* breach - of - contract suit 0 Warner brought *T*-1 against Sony for *PRO*-2 hiring the two producers, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story.
Warner tells another.
In the affidavits, Mr. Peters says 0 he was "shocked" when Mr. Ross refused a meeting and made it *EXP*-2 clear 0 he would stop them *T*-1.
Mr. Peters claims 0 he reminded Mr. Ross that Robert Daly and Terry Semel, the top executives of the Warner Brothers studio, had "repeatedly agreed that we had every right *PRO* to accept" an offer such as Sony's.
In response, Mr. Peters says 0 *?*, Mr. Ross referred to his colleagues at Warner with an "obscenity" and said: "*PRO* Tell them that they don't have a job.
You can take them with you."
Warner denies 0 Mr. Ross ever said any such thing, and, in fact, denies virtually everything 0 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say *T*-1 in their affidavits.
Tomorrow, Warner will file another batch of documents contending that "the essence of everything 0 these guys are saying *T*-1 is basically lies," says 0 *T*-2 Warner's chief outside counsel, Stuart Rabinowitz.
Thursday, a judge is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-3 to rule on Warner's motion seeking *PRO* to block the Guber - Peters duo from *PRO*-2 going to Columbia.
The battery of legal documents filed * in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight.
But they also make it *EXP*-1 clear that the first thing 0 a judge will have *-2 to decide *T*-3 is which, if any, version of events in this morass *T*-4 is fiction, and which *T*-5 fact.
The matter may never even be tried *-1 in court.
Warner says that what it really wants *T*-2 is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it *EXP*-3 unlikely that the decade - long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired *-1.
Warner, which *T*-1 is in the process of *PRO* merging with Time Warner Inc., says 0 it is willing *PRO*-2 to settle the matter out of court.
So far, however, Sony hasn't been willing *PRO*-1 to meet its considerable financial demands.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters don't have much 0 *PRO* to gain *T*-1 from a protracted battle.
Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, *PRO*-1 choosing instead *PRO*-2 to find someone else 0 *T*-3 to run Columbia, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed * to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.
In that case, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially, but they would be left *-1 without their dream job of *PRO* running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner.
At the center of any court fight will be *T*-1 the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role.
Sony and the Guber - Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner's willingness *ICH*-2 last year *PRO* to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement 0 they say 0 *T*-1 allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity *PRO* to run a major studio came up.
Warner denies 0 such an agreement was made *-1, and disputes the Guber - Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting 0 the two sides had *T*-2 on the matter.
Just how rancorous the relationship has become *T*-1 is clear from the differing versions of the two sides' current business dealings.
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps *PRO*-1 to freeze them out of their projects at Warner, notably the Sylvester Stallone film "Tango and Cash."
Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told *-1 last week that Warner was "taking over" the picture, and 0 another producer would be giving all of the orders.
Over his objections, Mr. Peters says 0 *?*, the film's release date was moved *-1 up "by many months" to December, and plans for a soundtrack "worth millions of dollars" were dropped *-2.
Hubert de la Bouillaire, an editor on the film, backs Mr. Peters in a separate sworn declaration.
Mr. de la Bouillaire says 0 Warner Brothers production president Mark Canton called him Oct. 19 and said 0 Mr. Peters is "off the picture.
If he calls you up, *PRO* just tell him 0 everything is fine."
The editor also says 0 the new producer on the film, Bruce Baird, told editors *PRO*-1 to screen the picture without *PRO*-2 telling stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell or Mr. Peters.
"The less they know *?*, the easier it is *?* for us.
If someone asks, *PRO* just lie and tell them 0 it will be done *-1," Mr. de la Bouillaire says 0 Mr. Baird told them *T*-2.
That, says 0 *?* Warner's Mr. Rabinowitz, is "a total 100% lie."
The movie, he says 0 *?*, is in its post-production stages of "*PRO* cleaning up the film."
He says 0 Mr. Peters and Mr. Guber, as the contractual producers with consultation rights, have been invited *-1 to screenings and *PRO*-2 to give their input on the film.
Dozens of Guber - Peters staffers are still working on the Warner lot and consulting on various projects on a "daily basis," the attorney says 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Guber, in his affidavit, says that when he advised Warner President Terry Semel of the Sony offer at lunch on Sept. 25 *T*-3, Mr. Semel "hugged and congratulated me, and expressed joy that we had finally realized our long - term ambition of *PRO* running *RNR*-1 and having an equity position in *RNR*-1 a major entertainment company."
Mr. Guber says 0 he brought to lunch a release document 0 Warner had agreed to *T*-1 in 1988, when he and Mr. Peters made an aborted bid *PRO* to buy part of MGM / UA Entertainment Co. *PRO*-2 to run the MGM studio *T*-3.
Mr. Guber says 0 he had crossed out "MGM" with a red pen and written in "Columbia," *PRO*-1 giving the document to Mr. Semel.
"Mr. Semel said absolutely nothing 0 *T*-2 to indicate 0 Warner would have any objection to our assuming management positions at Columbia," Mr. Guber says *T*-1.
Mr. Semel, in his affidavit, doesn't mention any hugging or congratulating.
He says 0 he told Mr. Guber 0 he couldn't sign any documents and that "the deal, although *PRO*-1 apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters, would have a very negative impact on Warner."
He said 0 he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly and that, in a conference call, the three agreed 0 they couldn't let the producers out of their contract.
Mr. Ross, in his own affidavit, says 0 he and Mr. Daly instructed Mr. Semel *PRO*-1 to tell the producers 0 Warner wouldn't terminate their agreement.
Mr. Guber says that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said 0 Mr. Ross was "crazy because of the Time deal," *PRO*-3 meaning, Mr. Guber says *T*-2, that Mr. Ross "did not want *PRO*-1 to communicate to his new merger partner, Time Inc., that Warner's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances."
Mr. Guber also says in his affidavit that Mr. Daly "told us that even if Sony did not want us, Warner's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged *-1, that there was no way ` 0 *PRO* to put the egg together *T*-2,' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money."
Moreover, Mr. Guber claims 0 *?*, Mr. Semel told him that Mr. Ross probably wouldn't object "if it were anybody other than Sony.
But Sony is a problem."
The Guber - Peters side has said 0 Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business.
Some in Hollywood suggest 0 Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally.
According to this theory, Warner executives, *PRO*-2 hoping *PRO*-1 to strengthen their relationships with the producers, encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions *PRO* to build a major entertainment company.
But the Warner executives in their affidavits deny *PRO*-1 ever telling the producers 0 they could get out of their written contract.
Mr. Rabinowitz, the Warner attorney, says 0 the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract.
"They are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects *ICH*-1 in development for Warner," he says *T*-2.
But Mr. Guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used *-1.
For example, he says that since 1985, he and Mr. Peters have developed over 85 movie projects, and Warner has "passed *RNR*-1" or chosen *PRO* not to produce *RNR*-1 at least 76.
As for the projects remaining at Warner, Mr. Guber says 0 *?*, "Mr. Semel informed me that Warner's producers have already started a ` feeding frenzy' for our projects.
Despite politicians' hand - wringing about the federal budget, the government ended fiscal 1989 with a $152.08 billion *U* deficit, about the same as the two previous years.
Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble *PRO* finding a silver lining in the report.
"I suppose 0 you could say 0 the good news is that the deficits are not heading up," he said *?*, "but you can't be satisfied *-1 with deficits at this level and we're not *?*."
The federal deficit was $155.15 billion *U* in 1988 and $149.69 billion *U* in 1987.
The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $10 billion *U* larger had the government been able *PRO*-1 to spend as much as Congress intended *?* on *PRO*-2 cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30.
Because the Resolution Trust Corp . couldn't spend the money fast enough, the savings - and - loan outlays were pushed *-1 into fiscal 1990.
Nevertheless, the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $136 billion *U* target set * by the Gramm - Rudman deficit - reduction law by $16 billion *U*, a reminder of that law's shortcomings.
The law sets a deficit target of $100 billion *U* for fiscal 1990.
A partisan fight over *PRO* cutting capital - gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit - reduction legislation almost to a halt, *PRO*-1 triggering across - the - board spending cuts under the Gramm - Rudman law.
The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for *PRO*-1 turning capital - gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year.
Neither side showed any sign of *PRO* retreating.
*PRO*-2 Meeting with reporters Friday, Mr. Darman again said 0 he would rather *ICH*-3 live with across - the - board spending cuts than *PRO* accept a deficit - reduction bill like the one passed * by the House, which *T*-1 would increase spending in future years.
*PRO*-1 Underscoring the size of the deficits of the past few years, the Treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid * on the public debt--$240.86 billion *U*--exceeded spending on Social Security, the single largest government program.
In all, federal outlays amounted to $1.143 trillion *U* in 1989, up 7.5% from the previous year, the Treasury said 0 *T*-1.
Federal revenues rose 9% to $990.79 billion *U*.
The Treasury said 0 a surge in tax receipts noted * earlier in the year didn't turn out *-1 to be quite as strong as it first appeared *-2 *?*.
The Treasury marked up its forecast by $17 million *U* in July, but that proved *-1 to be about $5 billion *U* too optimistic.
The government ran a deficit of $6.16 billion *U* in September, compared with a surplus of $10.17 billion *U* in September 1988.
Outlays for the month totaled $105.39 billion *U*, up from $87.57 billion *U* a year earlier.
The increase reflects spending on the S&L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued * in October that *T*-2 were issued *-1 in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday.
Revenues were $99.23 billion *U*, up from $97.74 billion *U* a year earlier.
Doskocil Cos. said 0 its bank - debt payments have been extended *-1 until May 31, 1990, *PRO* to give it more time 0 *PRO* to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations *T*-2.
The company was *-1 to repay $58 million *U* in debt on Dec. 31 and $15 million *U* on March 31.
The company acquired the debt when it paid $155 million *U* *PRO*-2 to purchase Wilson last year *T*-1.
An agreement *PRO* to sell the Wilson assets for $150 million *U* in cash and notes collapsed in late September, when the buyer, a company controlled * by George Gillett, couldn't secure financing *T*-1.
After days of intense but fruitless negotiations, a federal judge last week threatened *PRO*-1 to convert William Herbert Hunt's Chapter 11 personal bankruptcy case into a Chapter 7 liquidation.
Judge Harold C. Abramson raised the possibility after talks 0 *T*-1 to end a feud between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into roadblocks.
If the case is converted *-1 to Chapter 7, what *T*-3 remains of the oil tycoon's once - vast estate--now believed * to have a value of less than $125 million *U*--would be sold *-5 off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service, whose claim for $300 million *U* in back taxes *T*-2 has priority in the case.
Hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing, according to attorneys involved *.
While *PRO*-2 admitting 0 such a move would be "devastating" to most creditors, Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled * with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned *-1 about the toll 0 mounting legal bills will take *T*-3 on Mr. Hunt's shrinking estate and about the fact that, following voting by creditors, none of the reorganization plans appeared *-4 to be viable in their present form.
"It *EXP*-1 would be a shame *PRO* to have a Chapter 7 after all the progress in this case," said *T*-2 Judge Abramson.
Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, a company continues *-1 to operate under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan 0 *PRO* to pay its debts *T*-2.
Under Chapter 7, the assets of a company are sold off *-1 *PRO* to pay creditors.
Despite his reluctance *PRO* to take the latter step, the judge indicated 0 he would move quickly after *PRO*-1 hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and Minpeco S.A., a minerals concern owned * by the Peruvian governmemt.
The Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit, which *T*-1 is seeking repayment of a $36 million *U* loan, has asked the court *PRO*-3 to give its claim priority over that of Minpeco, which *T*-2 won a $132 million *U* judgment against Mr. Hunt, his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts *PRO* to corner the silver market in
While *PRO*-1 claiming that penalties, legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $250 million *U*, Minpeco has agreed *PRO*-1 to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $65.7 million *U*.
But even that is disputed *-1 by Manufacturers Hanover which, in alliance with the IRS, *T*-2 contends that Minpeco has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the silver - conspiracy case.
Under prodding from Judge Abramson, a Minpeco executive flew in from Peru last week *PRO*-1 to talk directly with executives from Manufacturers Hanover on a settlement.
Despite long private sessions in both New York and Dallas, the two sides ended the week "6,000 miles and many dollars apart," according to attorney Hugh Ray, who *T*-1 represents Manufacturers Hanover.
Meanwhile, inside the courtroom, the judge said 0 he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $50 *U* every time 0 they referred to each other with terms such as "liar" or "slime *T*-1."
All three major creditors--the IRS, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover--voted against *RNR*-1 and effectively doomed *RNR*-1 a reorganization plan proposed * by Mr. Hunt.
A reorganization plan proposed * jointly by the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover was stalled *-1 by a negative vote from Minpeco.
The mineral concern's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the IRS and Manufacturers Hanover.
Neither plan is dead, however, and the judge could force creditors *PRO*-2 to accept some version of them after *PRO*-1 ruling on the Minpeco - Manufacturers Hanover dispute.
Meanwhile, settlement negotiations continue between Mr. Hunt and the IRS, which *T*-1 has already reached a tentative agreement with Nelson Bunker Hunt.
The two sides have been far apart on how much Herbert Hunt will continue *-2 to owe the government *T*-3 after his assets are sold *-1.
APARTHEID FOES STAGED a massive anti-government rally in South Africa.
More than 70,000 people filled a soccer stadium on the outskirts of the black township of Soweto and welcomed freed leaders of the outlawed African National Congress.
It was considered *-1 South Africa's largest opposition rally.
Walter Sisulu, the ANC's former secretary general who *T*-2 served 26 years in prison before *T*-3 being released *-1 two weeks ago, urged peace, negotiation and discipline.
President de Klerk's government permitted the rally, and security forces didn't interfere.
Pretoria's approval of the demonstration and the ANC's conciliatory tone appeared *-1 aimed *-3 at *PRO* setting up negotiations 0 *T*-2 to give blacks political rights.
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS BACKED Bush's criticism of Nicaragua's Ortega.
While lawmakers haven't raised the possibility of *PRO* renewing military aid to the Contras following Ortega's weekend threat *PRO* to end a truce, Senate Majority Leader Mitchell said on NBC - TV that Ortega had made "a very unwise move.
" Minority Leader Dole plans *PRO*-2 to offer a resolution tomorrow *PRO*-3 denouncing the Nicaraguan president, whose remarks *T*-1 came during a celebration in Costa Rica marking regional moves to democracy.

John Lehman's editorial - page article on the Pentagon as a haunted house *ICH*-1 omits the real roots of its ghost population ("In the Pentagon, the Undead Walk," Oct. 18).
The media's treatment of the Defense Department during the Vietnam War, the Carter administration's denigration of the military, and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. Oliver North have all served *PRO*-2 to emasculate the poor souls who *T*-1 live there.
The resulting haunted house tends *-1 to reward followership, not leadership, it creates guilt about *PRO* wearing the uniform, and raises doubt about *PRO* having the will *PRO* to fulfill the ghosts' role, i.e., *PRO* to be able *PRO*-2 to win if *PRO* called on *-3.
Perhaps the Halloween season is a good time for Congress to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment.

Where does Mr. Lehman get off *PRO*-1 castigating Gen. George Marshall for *PRO*-3 muscling in on naval prerogatives *T*-2?
Ever since the days of Alfred Thayer Mahan (U.S. naval officer and naval historian) and Teddy Roosevelt the Navy has been the service most favored * by Washington officialdom.
Mr. Lehman overlooks the fact that the Navy possesses its own air force (the carrier fleet) and its own army (the Marines), which in turn *T*-1 has its own air force.
Of course these turf battles are unseemly, wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved *-2 in the interest of national security, but Mr. Lehman seems *-1 to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer.
L.H. Blum Beaumont, Texas
I agree with Mr. Lehman 100%!
Isn't this the same guy who *T*-1 resigned as Navy secretary because he couldn't get his 1,000 - ship Navy?

A two - day meeting of representatives of Cocom, the 17 - nation group that *T*-1 oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries, didn't take any substantive decisions on *PRO* trimming the list of items under controls.
Nor did it ease restrictions on exports to Poland and Hungary, according to U.S. officials who *T*-1 attended the talks.
The U.S. had been under pressure *ICH*-2 from several Cocom members, especially France, West Germany and Italy, *PRO* to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued 0 *T*-1 were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members.
For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more *ICH*-1 *PRO* to hamper their trade than *PRO* to add to Western security.
Some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for Hungary and Poland as they move toward more democratic rule, just as special treatment *ICH*-2 had been agreed on *-1 for China.
But U.S. officials said 0 representatives at the meeting decided that this was "a matter for further discussion at future meetings."
They added that "all of us (Cocom members) look at the changes in Hungary and Poland in a positive way, but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study."
The officials also said 0 the meeting agreed *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 treating China as a special case, despite the recent repression of dissent there, but to offer no further concessions.
The U.S. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, all the Cocom members agreed on "the continuing need for this organization," which *T*-2 was founded *-1 40 years ago at the start of the Cold War.
The officials said 0 the meeting agreed *PRO*-3 to continue *-2 working toward *PRO*-4 "streamlining" Cocom's restricted products list, and to improve procedures for *PRO* punishing companies that *T*-1 don't comply with the export restrictions.
The officials said 0 this meeting "put in motion" procedural steps that *T*-2 would speed up both of these functions, but that no specific decisions *ICH*-3 were taken *-1 on either matter.
Japanese companies have long been accused *-1 of *PRO* sacrificing profit *PRO*-2 to boost sales.
But Fujitsu Ltd. has taken that practice to a new extreme.
Japan's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors *PRO*-1 to win a contract *PRO* to design a mapping system for the city of Hiroshima's waterworks.
Its bid: one yen, or less than a U.S. penny.
The bid created such a furor that Fujitsu said 0 it is now offering *PRO*-1 to withdraw from the project.
"From a common - sense viewpoint, it was not socially acceptable," a Fujitsu spokeswoman said *T*-1 yesterday.
Hiroshima city officials couldn't be reached *-1 *PRO* to find out whether they would drop Fujitsu's bid.
Fujitsu said 0 it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market.
"We desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said 0 *T*-1.
"We expect a big market in the future, so in the long term it will be profitable.
It's a kind of an investment."
Hiroshima's waterworks bureau said 0 the municipal government had budgeted about 11 million yen ($77,500 *U*) for the project.
"I was flabbergasted *-3," Tatsuhara Yamane, head of the bureau, was quoted *-1 by Kyodo news service as *PRO*-4 saying *T*-2.
"I understand the firm's enthusiasm in *PRO* getting the deal, but such a large company would have been better off *PRO*-1 showing a little more discretion."
Indeed, Fujitsu officials admitted 0 they may have been a little overzealous.
The Fujitsu spokeswoman said 0 headquarter officials didn't approve the bid in advance and will take measures so this kind of thing doesn't happen in the future.
"It's contrary to common sense," she added *T*-1.
Specifically, Fujitsu won the right *PRO* to design the specifications for a computerized system that *T*-1 will show water lines throughout the city.
The system could be used *-1 in a fire or earthquake *PRO*-2 to locate problems, among other things.
A waterworks official said 0 Fujitsu will have *-1 to design the system so it would be compatible with other makers' equipment.
But industry officials expressed concern that the initial project might give Fujitsu an edge in *PRO* winning more lucrative contracts later.
Fujitsu said 0 it hopes 0 the Hiroshima contract will help it secure pacts with other municipalities.
Japanese local governments are expected *-1 to invest heavily in computer systems over the next few years, and many companies expect that field to provide substantial revenue.
"In the near future, it will be a big market, not just for waterworks, but for all mapping systems," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said *T*-1.
"We can expect a hundreds - of - billions - of - yen market."
No foreign companies bid on the Hiroshima project, according to the bureau.
But the Japanese practice of deep discounting often is cited *-1 by Americans as a classic barrier to entry in Japan's market.
Earlier this year, the U.S. complained that Japan's supercomputer makers were effectively closing out foreign competitors by *PRO*-1 slashing prices as much as 90% for universities.
Fujitsu wasn't the only company willing *PRO* to sacrifice profit on the project.
Three competitors bid between 300,000 yen and 500,000 yen, according to the Hiroshima government office.
Other bids ranged from about 10 million yen to 29 million yen.
Home taping of pre-recorded music cuts into record industry revenues, but *PRO* banning home taping would hurt consumers even more.
That's the conclusion of an independent report prepared * by the Office of Technology Assessment at the request of the House and Senate judiciary committees.
The report is *-2 to be released *-1 today.
The report says 0 the availability of such advanced analog recording equipment as cassette recorders doesn't seem *-1 to increase the quantity of home copying.
That finding, the report says 0 *?*, casts doubt on the record industry's contention that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of copyrighted material by home tapers.
The longstanding position of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group based * in Washington, D.C., is that record companies, performers, songwriters and music publishers need *-2 to be remunerated *-1 by government - imposed fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment *PRO* to make up for royalties lost * to home taping.
"I think 0 it is a nail in the coffin in any royalty tax proposal," says *T*-1 Gary Shapiro, vice president for government and legal affairs of the Electronic Industries Association in Washington.
"What {the report} shows *T*-1 is everything 0 we've been saying *T*-2 for the past eight or nine years--that audio taping is the best thing 0 *T*-3 to happen for the recording industry.
The people who *T*-1 tape the most buy the most."
Trish Heimers, a spokesperson for RIAA says 0 her organization hasn't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment.
A recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape, or DAT, recorder sold * in the U.S. have a built - in device that *T*-1 restricts its ability *PRO* to make second copies from DAT tape copies of digital compact disks.
But the disappointing sales of DAT machines here and abroad so far have not seemed *-2 to warrant the three years of legal wrangling that *T*-1 went into the agreement.
Under current copyright laws, it *EXP*-3 is considered *-1 "fair use" *PRO* to reproduce copyrighted material for one's personal use or for use by one's family or friends, while *PRO* copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited *-2.
A survey contained * in the 291 - page report, "Copyright and Home Copying: Technology Challenges the Law," found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a "right"--a right, moreover, that *T*-2 was exercised *-1 by 40% of Americans over the age of 10 in the past year.
The study says that the "ambiguous legal status" of home copying makes it *EXP*-1 "appropriate *PRO* to examine the effects on consumers, as well as on industry."
Reports by the Office of Technology Assessment don't prescribe any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that Congress may pursue *T*-1.
The study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes "an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order *PRO* to reduce legal and market uncertainties and *PRO* to prevent de facto changes to copyright law through technology," and says that *PRO* finding an "appropriate balance of harms and benefits is a political decision, not a technical one.

TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to shift its headquarters to Calgary, Alberta, from Toronto next year *PRO*-2 to cut costs and be closer to the upstream natural - gas industry.
Gerald Maier, president *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of the natural - gas pipeline and marketing concern, said 0 the company's future growth is "increasingly linked" to decisions made * by Calgary - based gas producers.
"Since deregulation of the market in 1985, producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing," Mr. Maier said *T*-1 . "
It's a matter of *PRO* being close to those suppliers; many of those companies don't know us as well as they should *?*."
TransCanada transports all gas that *T*-1 moves eastward from Alberta.
That includes all the gas consumed * in Ontario and Quebec, along with the bulk of Canadian gas exports to the
Walter Litvinchuk, vice president of Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd., a Calgary - based gas marketing concern, said 0 the industry will welcome the move.
"*PRO* Having more than a token presence here should enhance communications and business relationships," Mr. Litvinchuk said *T*-1 . "
Since the cost of *PRO* transporting gas is so important to producers' ability *PRO* to sell it, it *EXP*-1 helps *PRO* to have input and access to transportation companies."
The move, which *T*-1 could cost TransCanada as much as 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million *U*) in relocation and severance payments, should be complete by next summer, Mr. Maier said *T*-2.
All 700 Toronto - based employees will be offered *-1 positions in Calgary, the company said 0 *T*-2.
The company will save between C$4 million and C$6 million *U* annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by *PRO*-2 moving to Calgary, Mr. Maier added 0 *T*-1.
Part of both the costs and the savings could be passed *-1 on to shippers on the TransCanada pipeline through tolls, which *T*-3 are based *-2 on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of *PRO* operating it.

Most recently he had been executive vice president for planning and finance at Texas Air.
Top executives at Continental *ICH*-1 haven't lasted long, especially those recruited * from outside.
But Mr. Corr's tenure was shorter than most.
The 48 - year - old Mr. Corr was hired *-1 largely because he was credited *-2 with *PRO*-3 returning Trans World Airlines Inc. to profitability while he was its president from 1986 to 1988.
Before that, he was an executive with a manufacturing concern.
At Continental he cut money - losing operations, which *T*-1 helped *PRO*-2 produce a modest profit in this year's second quarter.
But Mr. Corr, a stunt pilot in his spare time, was understood *PRO*-1 to be frustrated *-2 by what he regarded *T*-3 as limited freedom under Mr. Lorenzo.
While *PRO*-1 not officially an executive at Continental during Mr. Corr's tenure, Mr. Lorenzo is known *-1 for *PRO*-2 keeping close tabs on Texas Air's operating units.
Continental is Texas Air's flagship and was built *-1 painfully to its present size under Mr. Lorenzo after *PRO*-1 emerging from bankruptcy proceedings in 1986.
It *EXP*-2's unclear what role, if any, Mr. Lorenzo's recent exploration of a possible sale of a stake in Continental had *T*-1 in Mr. Corr's departure.
One source familiar with the airline said, however, that Mr. Corr wasn't informed *-1 in advance during the summer when Mr. Lorenzo began discussions with potential buyers *T*-2.
During his tenure, Mr. Corr attempted through a series of meetings *PRO*-1 to inform managers of some of the company's future plans, traveled widely *PRO*-1 to talk to employees and backed training sessions designed * *PRO*-2 to improve the carrier's image.
Mr. Foret is one of a handful of executives 0 Mr. Lorenzo has relied on *T*-1 over the years.
Previously, he had served in financial planning positions at the company's Eastern Airlines unit.
Another longtime ally, Phil Bakes, currently heads Eastern, now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
Mr. Bakes previously had a turn at *PRO*-1 running Continental.
Among the other alumni are *T*-1 Stephen Wolf, now chairman of UAL Inc., and Thomas Plaskett, president of Pan Am Corp.
The envelope arrives in the mail.
*PRO* Open it and two soulful eyes on a boy's brown face peer out from the page, pleadingly.
Does the tyke have a good mind about *PRO* to be wasted *-1?
Is he a victim of Gramm - Rudman cuts?
No, but he's endangered all the same: His new sitcom on ABC needs a following *PRO*-1 to stay on the air.
ABC hasn't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years, and the producers of one new arrival are a bit desperate.
"Homeroom," a show about a black ad executive who *T*-1 gives up the boardroom for a fourth - grade classroom, is flunking the ratings test.
So producers Alyce and Topper Carew spun their Rolodexes and gathered names of black opinion makers *PRO*-1 to mount a direct - mail campaign.
By *PRO*-1 wooing a core black audience they figure 0 they might keep the show alive *PRO*-2 at least until the spring semester.
*PRO* Using direct mail for a TV show is like *PRO* fishing for whale with a breaded hook.
It just isn't done *-1.
But *PRO* employing this kind of gut - wrenching plea to black consciousness makes it even more unusual.
Still, Mr. Carew thinks 0 he can reach a good chunk of the three million - plus black homes 0 he needs *T*-3 by *PRO*-4 mailing to the almost 10,000 blacks who *T*-1 form what he calls *T*-2 "*PRO*-5 the grapevine."
"The grapevine isn't organized, but you and I know 0 it exists," says *T*-1 Mr. Carew, *PRO*-2 referring to the often uncannily small world of black professionals and community leaders.
"This is a very personal, ethnic style," Mr. Carew says *T*-1 . "
I want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the rib joints to be talking about the show.
I want white America to talk about it, too, but I'm convinced that the grapevine is what *T*-1's happening."
ABC says 0 it is aware of the producers' action, but the mailing was sent *-1 without the network's blessing.
The letter, in fact, takes a jab at ABC for *PRO* being a laggard in black programming.
Meanwhile, as the Sunday evening show struggles *PRO*-2 to stay afloat against the tough competition of "Murder, She Wrote *-3," the grapevine idea is threatening *PRO*-1 to turn into a weed: The tactic apparently has inspired sample viewings, but accolades are slow in *PRO* coming.
Doug Alligood, a black advertising executive who *T*-1 tracks black viewing patterns, gives the Carews an "A" for marketing moxie, but isn't alone in his lukewarm reaction.
Some shows just don't impress, he says 0 *?*, and this is one of them.
McDonnell Douglas Corp. received contracts totaling $244.8 million *U* for 72 F - A - 18 aircraft for the Navy and helicopter spare parts for the Army.
Aerojet General Corp., a unit of GenCorp Inc., was awarded *-1 a $40.1 million *U* Air Force contract for Minuteman missile rocket motors.
Rockwell International Corp. received a $26.7 million *U* Navy contract for submarine ballistic missiles.
Honeywell Inc. got a $22.3 million *U* Navy contract for aircraft missile warning sets.
Beech Aircraft Corp., a unit of Raytheon Co., received an $11.5 million *U* Air Force contract for C - 12 aircraft support.
CMS Energy Corp. said 0 it would begin *-1 paying a 10 - cent - a - share quarterly dividend, the company's first since 1984.
Consumers Power Co., now the main unit of CMS Energy, ran into financial problems over its $4.2 billion *U* Midland nuclear plant, which *T*-2 was abandoned *-1 as a nuclear facility in 1984 because of construction delays and high costs.
CMS is nearly done *PRO*-1 converting the Midland plant to a gas - fired cogeneration facility at a cost of $600 million *U*.
CMS management said Thursday that they planned *PRO*-1 to recommend *PRO*-3 paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met Friday *T*-2.
The dividend will be paid *-1 Nov. 22 to shares of record Nov. 7.
The company suffered a loss of $270 million *U* in 1985, but its financial situation has been improving since then.
General Motors Corp.'s GMC Truck division put a $750 *U* cash incentive on its 1990 full - sized Jimmy and Suburban trucks.
The program, which *T*-1 runs through Jan. 4, also offers low - rate financing in lieu of the cash rebate.
Humana Inc. said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to receive about $27 million *U* in federal income - tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute.
The health - care company said 0 it expects the refund to be included *-1 in the first quarter ending Nov. 30.
The refund is about $9 million *U*.
Accrued interest on the refund was about $18 million *U* as of Oct. 25.
The refund stems from a court ruling that *T*-1 found 0 certain payments by Humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal 1977 through 1979 were deductible as premiums for liability insurance.
In the second step of a reorganization that *T*-1 began earlier this year, Boeing Co. said 0 it will create a Defense and Space Group 0 *T*-2 to consolidate several divisions.
Meanwhile, Boeing officials and representatives of the Machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt *PRO* to break the month - old strike that *T*-1 has shut the aerospace giant's assembly lines at a time when it has an $80 billion *U* backlog of jetliner orders *T*-2.
The two sides were scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to meet with the mediator this morning.
Machinists already have rejected a package that *T*-1 would provide a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three - year life of the contract.
Boeing has said repeatedly 0 it won't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer isn't good enough.
However, the resolve of some of the striking 57,000 machinists might be weakening.
About 1,000 strikers signed petitions last week *PRO*-1 calling for Boeing and Machinists representatives to schedule new meetings.
The two sides hadn't met since Oct. 18.
While Boeing's commercial business is booming, its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the Reagan presidency.
In May, the company consolidated its Aerospace and Electronics groups; the new Defense and Space Group will contain the Aerospace and Electronics division and Advanced Systems, both based * in the Seattle area; Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia; Boeing Military Airplanes in Wichita, Kan., and ArgoSystems in Sunnyvale, Calif.
B. Dan Pinick, president of Boeing Aerospace and Electronics, will become president of the new group, which *T*-1 will become operational Jan. 2.
In addition, Boeing said 0 it also will reorganize all its work in Wichita into military and commercial divisions.
All of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations, Boeing said 0 *T*-1.
Analysts agreed.
"It's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business," said *T*-1 Steven Binder, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. in New York.
"They had *-1 to do it."
Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, said 0 the shift reflects Boeing confidence in Mr. Pinick, described * by Mr. Rubel as an expert on *PRO* doing business with the military.
"His side of the business has been successful in a tough environment," Mr. Rubel said *T*-1.
Ferro Corp. said 0 it will buy back as many as one million common shares.
The maker of chemical and industrial materials didn't say how much it would pay *T*-3 or when it would make the transactions *T*-2.
Ferro also said 0 it would cancel the unused portion of a 1987 buy - back plan for administrative reasons.
The plan calls for the company to buy back 2,250,000 shares, which *T*-3 reflects a 3 - for - 2 stock split this year.
So far the company had bought back 1.6 million shares.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ferro closed at $25.25 *U*, down 50 cents.
Australia's inflation is expected *-1 to rise as high as 8.3% in the quarter ending March 30, but could fall to around 7% by June, according to economists.
The government said 0 the consumer price index rose 2.3% in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from the previous quarter and 8% from a year ago.
There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad *T*-1.
After years of mistrust born * of Watergate, past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Iran - Contra scandal, President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear *-1 ready *ICH*-3--for now, at least--*PRO*-4 to trust each other when it comes to *PRO* setting policy on covert activities *T*-2.
If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that *T*-2 hasn't been seen *-1 in years.
Over the past week, the president has agreed *PRO*-1 to keep the committee informed *-2, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.
That wasn't always the way 0 the Reagan administration handled such matters *T*-1.
Mr. Bush has pledged as well *PRO*-1 to respect the 14 - year - old executive order barring U.S. agents from *PRO*-2 assassinating foreign leaders or helping others *PRO*-3 to do so.
Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter *PRO*-1 to honor the ban.
Despite objections by the CIA, Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA who *T*-1 would be independent of the CIA director.
In return, the Senate panel has dropped efforts *PRO* to enact legislation requiring the administration *PRO*-1 to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity.
It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed *PRO*-1 to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put * in place *PRO*-2 to ensure that the CIA didn't get back in the assassination game.
"We've finally been able *PRO*-2 to convince them that Casey and {Oliver} North don't work here anymore," says *T*-1 one administration official.
The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light.
It emerged after a rancorous display of old - style intelligence politics that *T*-1 followed this month's failed coup attempt in Panama.
The White House used television appearances and leaks *PRO*-1 to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult.
Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan - era deal with Congress required him *PRO*-2 to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that *T*-1 might endanger his life.
The president also hinted 0 he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive.
Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla .) and Vice Chairman William Cohen (R., Maine), for their part, angrily accused the White House of *PRO*-3 selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly *PRO*-2 to shift the blame *ICH*-1 to Congress for the bungled attempt *PRO* to topple Gen. Noriega.
The White House got the better of the exchange but took care *PRO*-2 not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought * by conservative Republicans who *T*-1 don't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities.
Instead, Mr. Bush and his aides made it clear 0 they respected Congress's role and felt 0 they could work with the conservative Mr. Boren and the moderate Mr. Cohen *PRO*-1 to iron out their differences.
The senators responded in kind.
Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed * during the Reagan years.
Sen. Cohen said 0 the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character.
There still are some details 0 *T*-1 to be nailed *-2 down.
Mr. Bush is reserving the right *ICH*-3 in "rare" instances *PRO* to keep Congress in the dark, *PRO*-2 asserting a constitutional prerogative 0 the committee doesn't recognize *T*-1.
And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that *T*-2 would have *-3 to be settled *-1.
Moreover, both sides may face political critics.
Some conservatives will accuse the president of *PRO*-1 promising Congress too much.
And they continue *-1 anonymously attacking CIA Director William Webster for *PRO*-2 being too accommodating to the committee.
At the same time, some congressional liberals will accuse Sens. Boren and Cohen of *PRO*-1 wimping out, and they will warn that the lawmakers' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the Iran arms sales.
But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities, the country could be entering an era when such hare - brained schemes are scrapped *-1 before they get off the drawing boards, while risky but well - planned secret operations can be undertaken *-2 without fear that a panicky Congress will balk *T*-3.
CRA Ltd. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to sell a 40% stake in its Howick coal mine in the state of New South Wales to Mitsubishi Development Pty. of Japan.
The price wasn't disclosed *-1.
The agreement is subject to government approval.
RA acquired the Howick coal mine Oct. 20 when it bought British Petroleum Co.'s Australian coal interests for $275 million *U* *T*-1.
CRA said then that it was looking for a partner for the mine, which *T*-1 produces more than three million metric tons of coal a year.
CRA is 49% - owned by RTZ Corp. of Britain.
Weisfield's Inc. said 0 it is in preliminary discussions regarding the possible sale of the company.
A spokesman for the retail jeweler said 0 the company would provide more details today and that it expects *PRO*-1 to reach a definitive agreement by the end of the week.
In over - the - counter trading Friday, Weisfield's gained $9.50 *U* to $39 *U*.
At that price, the company has an indicated value of $42.9 million *U*.
Weisfield's had about 1.1 million shares outstanding as of July 31.
The stock gained $2.75 *U* Thursday *PRO*-1 to close at a then - 52 week high.
Chamberlain Manufacturing Corp. won a $25.8 million *U* Army contract for 155mm artillery shell casings.
Avondale Industries Inc. received a $13.5 million *U* Navy contract for ship spare parts.
Analog Devices Inc. said 0 it may purchase as many as one million of its common shares over the next several months.
Analog also said that a one million share buy - back program announced * in March is substantially complete.
The company, which *T*-1 makes integrated circuits and other electronic parts, now has about 47 million common shares outstanding.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Analog Devices closed at $8.875 *U*, up 25 cents.
Small businesses say 0 a recent trend is like a dream come true: more - affordable rates for employee - health insurance, initially at least.
But then they wake up to a nightmare.
The reasonable first - year rates can be followed *-1 by increases of 60% or more if a covered employee files a major claim, they complain *T*-2.
Insurance premiums for one small Maryland concern went up 130% in less than two years, the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk.
"There's a distinct possibility that I may lose my job over this," the employee, Karen Allen, of Floor Covering Resources, Kensington, Md., recently told a congressional hearing *T*-1.
She said 0 her employer can't afford the rate increases, and she fears 0 she won't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment.
For employee and employer alike, the worry is widespread.
Surveys repeatedly show that small - business owners rank the availability *RNR*-1 and rising cost *RNR*-1 of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee, headed * by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California, is looking into complaints that small businesses not only can't keep reasonably priced employee - health insurance if claims are filed *-1, but often can't get coverage at all if a worker is termed *-2 *PRO*-3 medically uninsurable.
"I have an old - fashioned name for people in that position: sick people who *T*-1 need health insurance," Rep. Waxman says *T*-2 . "
What we're seeing *T*-1 now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: *PRO* collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills."
Some lawmakers may seek legislation 0 *PRO* to limit overly restrictive insurance policies *T*-1.
The concern grows out of increased efforts *ICH*-1 by the insurers *PRO* to woo the small - business market.
As larger companies increasingly self - insure, or use reserves *PRO*-2 to pay their own workers' medical bills, the insurance industry has turned to the small - employer market that *T*-1 was once a backwater for them.
"Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice," says Rosemary Heinhold of the Small Business Service Bureau, a group representing 35,000 small businesses nationwide.
"One case of cancer or a high - risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60% *U*.
Small - business people end up *PRO*-1 paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness."
In addition, the group says 0 some of its member companies have been denied *-1 insurance because individual workers had medical problems that *T*-2 ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce, hemorrhoids and overweight.
The Health Insurance Association of America, an insurers' trade group, acknowledges that stiff competition *ICH*-1 among its members *PRO* to insure businesses likely *PRO* to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small - business market.
But it says that rapid rate increases are directly tied *-1 to the soaring cost of health care.
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market.
They say 0 insurance companies use policies aimed * at *PRO* excluding bad risks because their competitors do *?*.
But the general practice makes it *EXP*-1 more difficult *PRO* to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus *PRO*-2 spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums.
"I'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty," Robert Patricelli of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told Mr. Waxman's panel *T*-1.
"You can't ask one carrier *PRO*-2 to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace *T*-1."
Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation 0 *T*-1 to deal with the problem.
The proposal is just part of legislation that *T*-1 would require businesses *PRO*-5 to provide health benefits, an idea that *T*-2 is strongly opposed *-4 by small business who *T*-3 say 0 it would just compound the insurance - cost problems.
But small - business lobbyists say 0 they support the idea, included * in the Kennedy - Waxman bill, of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating, which *T*-2 pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group, and *T*-2 is designed *-3 *PRO*-1 to prevent insurance companies from *PRO*-4 taking only low - risk small companies as clients.
But first on the list of priorities, says 0 *?* the National Federation of Independent Business, is *T*-1 *PRO* to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans.
Such requirements, they argue 0 *?*, make it *EXP*-2 difficult *PRO* to provide a basic, low - cost health - benefits package.
"Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental - health care be covered *-1, there were only 70 mental - health clinics in the state; now there are 400," says *T*-2 Carolyn Miller, an NFIB lobbyist.
She contends that similar mandates have driven up insurance costs 20% in Maryland and 30% in California.
The insurance - industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating, which "*T*-1 doesn't save one dollar," argues *T*-2 James Dorsch, HIAA's Washington counsel.
"It just makes healthy businesses subsidize unhealthy ones and gives each employer less incentive *PRO* to keep his workers *PRO*-1 healthy."
Mr. Dorsch says 0 the HIAA is working on a proposal *PRO* to establish a privately funded reinsurance mechanism 0 *T*-2 to help *PRO*-3 cover small groups that *T*-1 can't get insurance without *PRO*-4 excluding certain employees.
The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult *PRO* to predict.
But to Ms. Allen, the employee whose back problem *T*-1 triggered a huge insurance - rate increase, the issue was simple.
"What good is *T*-1 *PRO* having health insurance," she asked *?*, "when it's so expensive that it becomes impossible 0 *PRO* to keep *T*-4 after only one major claim *T*-3?
It is a peaceful time in this part of western India.
The summer crop is harvested *-1, winter sowing has yet *-2 to begin.
Farmers in loose turbans and fancy earrings spend their afternoons *PRO*-1 laughing and gossiping at the markets.
One could imagine such a lull in the lives of the Arabs before the quadrupling of oil prices.
For just as the Arabs were *?* in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame.
The Arabs had merely oil.
These farmers may have a grip on the world's very heart.
Or, at least, its heart disease.
That is because Sidhpur has a near - monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known * as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, *T*-1 may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.
Ever since the link to cholesterol was disclosed *-1, Americans have begun *-2 scarfing up psyllium in their breakfast cereals.
If further research proves the seed's benefits, this dusty farm district could become the epicenter of a health - food fad 0 *T*-1 to rival all fads since cod - liver oil.
"This seed's not grown *-2 anywhere else in India, or anywhere else in the world," says *T*-1 T.V. Krishnamurthy, a vice president of Procter & Gamble India Ltd., a major psyllium buyer and promoter.
"The proper climatic conditions don't exist in many places in the world."
Arvind Patel, a processor and exporter of the seed, raves: "If psyllium takes the place of oat bran, it will be huge."
Whether psyllium makes Sidhpur's fortune depends on cholesterol - fearing Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, of course, the outcome of further research.
Only one thing *ICH*-1 is certain here: Pysllium is likely *-2 to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time.
Local farmers say 0 it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek, a legume.
But they have no desire *PRO* to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning, and, perhaps, little need: *PRO*-1 lean, frugal vegetarians, the farmers are innocents in the clogged, treacherous world of cholesterol.
Psyllium is an annual herb, Plantago ovata, that *T*-2 has been used *-1 for centuries by folk doctors here, mainly as a laxative and anti-diarrheal.
As such, the soluble fiber has an almost fanatic following in northern India.
"I can assure you," attests *?* a 25 - year - old lawyer in New Delhi, with a meaningfully raised eyebrow, "from personal experience, 0 it works."
A prominent businessman in Bombay gives a similar testimonial: "I have been taking it daily since 1961.
" Folk doctors also prescribe it for kidney, bladder and urethra problems, duodenal ulcers and hemorrhoids.
Some apply it to gouty joints.
The plant has a hairy stem that *T*-1 produces flowers and diminutive seeds.
It is the seed's colorlessness and size--1,000 of them weigh only 1.5 grams, or about as much as two paper clips--that *T*-1 explain the historical allusions to fleas.
The transluscent husk of the seed is removed, sifted and crushed *-1; the seed itself is fed *-2 to animals.
Some 90% of the crop, which *T*-2 was worth $26 million *U* last year, is exported *-1.
For decades, psyllium husk has been the main ingredient in such laxatives as Procter & Gamble Co.'s Metamucil, the top - selling brand in the U.S., and Ciba - Geigy Corp.'s Fiberall.
But some time ago, researchers discovered that soluble fibers also lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
Cincinnati - based P&G took an interest; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol.
One of the studies, done * at the University of Minnesota, tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels.
After 16 weeks, the group that *T*-1 took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels, and an even larger reduction in levels of low - density lipoproteins, the so - called bad cholesterol.
In late 1987, P&G asked the FDA for approval *PRO* to market Metamucil as the first non-prescription, cholesterol - lowering product in the
In April, the psyllium bandwagon got more crowded.
General Mills Inc., the food giant, launched a breakfast cereal called * *PRO*-2 Benefit, containing psyllium, oat, wheat and beet bran; the words, "*PRO* reduce cholesterol" were prominently displayed *-1 on its package.
In September, Kellogg Co. launched a competing psyllium - fortified cereal called * *PRO*-1 Heartwise.
Suddenly, on television, in advertisements and on their cereal boxes, Americans were inundated *-1 with news about the obscure seed.
The flood of claims and counter-claims worried consumers and actually hurt sales of the new cereals.
This month, the Food and Drug Administration expressed concern that Americans might someday, in various forms, ingest too much psyllium.
Currently, there is a lull in the psyllium war.
The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills *PRO*-1 to show research that their cereals are safe.
It also ordered P&G *PRO*-2 to produce more studies 0 *T*-1 to buttress its claims that Metamucil can lower cholesterol.
But the agency hasn't yanked psyllium off store shelves.
If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium, other companies are expected *-1 to rush to market with psyllium products.
"It's going *-1 to be a sensational thing," says *T*-2 Mr. Krishnamurthy of P&G in Bombay.
Says *ICH*-1 psyllium exporter Mr. Patel: "I just got back yesterday from the U.S. .
In the newspapers, on the radio and TV, psyllium is everywhere."
But the news of the boom has yet *-1 to trickle down to the farmers.
They only know of one use for the crop, as a laxative, and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop, they think of the seed as a marginal crop, something 0 *PRO* to grow *T*-1 between summer wheat crops.
"Psyllium's not a good crop," complains Sooraji Jath, a 26 - year - old farmer from the village of Lakshmipura . "
You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined *-1."
Even at the Basic Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council, the government agency that *T*-1 promotes the seed, the psyllium boom is distant thunder.
The staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to American regularity, without *PRO*-1 quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol.
The council's annual report has psyllium on its last page, *PRO*-2 lumped *-3 with such unglamorous export items as sarsaparilla and "Nux vomica," a plant that *T*-1 induces vomiting.
In one way, the psyllium middlemen--the buyers and exporters--are glad *PRO*-1 to keep news of the boom to themselves.
They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year.
But there's a catch.
Sidhpur and adjacent districts are the only places in the world where psyllium is grown *-1 in large quantities *T*-2.
This is partly due to the particular demands of the crop.
Psyllium needs sandy soil, dew during the first few weeks, and then total dryness when its seeds are maturing *T*-1.
Small crops are grown *-1 in Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Brazil, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium.
Big buyers like Procter & Gamble say 0 there are other spots on the globe, and in India, where the seed could be grown *-1 *T*-2.
"It's not a crop that *T*-1 can't be doubled or tripled *-2," says *T*-3 Mr. Krishnamurthy.
But no one has made a serious effort *PRO* to transplant the crop.
In Sidhpur, it is almost time 0 *PRO* to sow this year's crop *T*-1.
Many farmers, too removed *PRO* to glean psyllium's new sparkle in the West, have decided *PRO*-1 to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenugreek or castor - oil seeds.
Mr. Jath is thinking of *PRO*-1 passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel.
"Maybe I'll plant castor - oil seeds."
His brother, Parkhaji, whose head *T*-2 is swathed *-1 in a gorgeous crimson turban, nods vigorous assent.
So when next year's psyllium crop is harvested *-1 in March *T*-2, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years--right at the crest of the psyllium boom.
And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage.
Well, the arrogant East Coast media have spoken again ("*PRO* Going for the Green," editorial, Oct. 17).
*PRO*-1 Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years, I find it *EXP*-3 hard *PRO* to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing *RNR*-2 and head aching *RNR*-2 from the polluted air *T*-4; when I try *PRO*-6 to enjoy the beaches and come home *PRO*-6 covered *-8 with tar and oil *T*-5; when I hear of numerous deaths related * to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing *T*-7.
Perhaps it *EXP*-1's entertaining for those like you *PRO* to discount the concerns of environmentalists, *PRO*-2 suggesting that their *PRO* save - the - earth initiatives are "whacky" and referring to so many citizens as "la - la activists."
Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who *T*-1 seek *PRO*-2 to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste.
While there are no easy low - cost solutions, *PRO* simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state, the nation and the world.
If nothing else, such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action.
Before your next California - bashing editorial, please *PRO* spend more time out here *PRO*-2 witnessing the situation--it just may change your view.
John Barry Ventura, Calif.
I realize 0 you were just looking for something snotty 0 *PRO* to say *T*-1 about California and its environmental movement, but *PRO* picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call.
Wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among "la - la activists."
Indeed, Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons 0 he learned *T*-2 were derived *-1 from the study of nature.
Obviously, it *EXP*-1's lost on you that about 75% of the American people *ICH*-2 these days (and in fact the president of the United States) consider themselves environmentalists.
As for California being a state run * by liberal environmental loonies, *PRO* let's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from *T*-1.
Perhaps Mr. Reagan, who *T*-2 claimed that air pollution is caused *-1 by trees, is the man 0 you should be quoting *T*-3 *PRO*-4 to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth.
But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who *T*-1 said, "Is this not Anti-Christ?
The Moloch that *T*-1 knows no God but more?"
Robert Borden Santa Monica, Calif.
Your editorial *ICH*-2 was commendable and neatly matched *-1 by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, "Alar: *PRO* Scaring on the Side of Caution."
The illogic and inaccuracy of John H. Adams's comments for the National Resources Defense Council fully justifies your characterization of California's Greens in particular as "la - la activists."
We may all hope that California's voters will heed the scientific realities that their own university's renowned Prof. Tom Jukes provides them *T*-1 and ignore the charlatanry profferred * by their "wealthy Hollywood weepers."
I have a different approach 0 *PRO* to offer *T*-1, not only to Californians, but to all Americans.
In a free country, the law should restrict citizens as little as *PRO* is consistent with good manners and public safety.
*PRO* Would - be naysayers should have the burden of *PRO* proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law *T*-1.
W. Brown Morton Jr . Warsaw, Va.
The 170 airlines in the International Air Transport Association last year posted group net profit of $2.5 billion *U* on revenue of $125.1 billion *U*.
According to the association's annual report, scheduled *PRO* to be released *-1 today in Warsaw, IATA members haven't posted such a strong performance since the late 1970s.
Revenue last year increased by more than 11% over 1988, and net income nearly tripled from restated year - earlier net of $900 million *U*.
The group attributed the strong results to the favorable economic climate, rising demand for air travel and improved average yield (revenue received * per ton of traffic transported * a kilometer).
Systemwide, IATA airlines carried 632 million passengers *ICH*-1 last year, 2% more than in 1987.
But passenger - kilometers, the distance flown * while *PRO* carrying people, increased 5.3% in 1988.
The association said that lack of airport and air space capacity is the biggest problem facing the airline industry.
The KGB has abolished a unit known * for *PRO*-2 persecuting dissidents, the government newspaper Izvestia said 0 *T*-1.
The newspaper quoted KGB chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov as *PRO*-1 saying 0 the definition of anti-Soviet crimes had narrowed, the laws had changed and people no longer have *-2 to fear a simple slip of the tongue.
Mr. Kryuchkov was quoted *-1 as *PRO*-2 saying that in place of the infamous 5th Directorate a new unit would work "*PRO*-3 to foil the conspiracies *ICH*-4 of foreign intelligence services *PRO* to create and use organized anti-government groups in our country."
Czechoslovakia has restricted consumer - goods exports to neighbor countries because of "massive buying out of food" by tourists from Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union, the Rude Pravo daily said 0 *T*-1.
Rising inflation in Poland and Hungary makes Czechoslovak food, clothing and shoes relatively cheap for visitors from these countries.
The paper gave no details of what the restrictions would entail *T*-1 but said 0 the measures were necessary *PRO* to protect the domestic market.
West Germany's biggest union, IG Metall, said 0 it is ready *PRO*-1 to back demands for more pay and shorter hours with strikes against the nation's automotive, steel and engineering industries.
Its chairman told the union *PRO*-1 to prepare for the worst in next year's confrontation with employers over a new three - year wage deal.
A major goal is *PRO* to cut the working week to 35 hours from the present 37.
Last week came news of alarm in Venice over a plan *PRO* to tap gas fields off the city's coast.
Now comes word *ICH*-2 from a scientist that over the next century Venice will sink nearly three times faster than the present rate because of the "greenhouse effect."
"Global warming means higher tides which *T*-1 will lower Venice by another 23 inches in the next 100 years," Giovanni Cecconi of the the New Venice Consortium said *T*-2.
The consortium of scientists and companies was set *-1 up by Italy *PRO*-1 to help *PRO*-2 preserve the fabled city of canals.
Venice has sunk 10 inches in this century.
West Germany's Quelle said 0 it will establish a mail - order operation with two local partners in the Soviet Union next year.
*PRO*-1 Saying 0 this is a first for a Western company, West Germany's largest mail - order group said 0 the newly established Moscow - based Intermoda company is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to begin operations in February 1990.
Intermoda will initially only send the textile and clothing section of the Quelle catalog, translated * into Russian, to Soviet customers who *T*-1 have access to convertible currency.
The European Community Commission has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of South Korean small - screen color - television sets.
*PRO*-1 Saying that a surge in low - priced imports had damaged EC producers' profits and led to job losses, the commission imposed a duty of 10.2% on TVs made * by Daewoo, a duty of 12.3% on Goldstar Co., 13% on Samsung and 19.6% on TVs made * by other South Korean producers.
The commission said that EC television producers lost "important market shares" and suffered an "unsustainable" pressure on prices because of the Korean companies' marketing and pricing policies, which it said 0 *T*-1 were "in clear violation" of international trade rules.
In other news concerning South Korea's television industry, Samsung signed an agreement *ICH*-1 with Soyuz, the external - trade organization of the Soviet Union, *PRO* to swap Korean television sets and videocassette recorders for pig iron from the Soviet Union.
South Korea and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations but exchanged trade offices earlier this year.
Sri Lanka, where more than 15,000 people have died in six years of ethnic turmoil *T*-1, said 0 it will ban sex and violence from state - owned television next year.
"Many programs 0 we have *T*-1 now come from the West and are not suitable to our culture," a government minister said *T*-2.
A star attraction on the national network is the U.S.'s "Dynasty ."...
A poll of South Koreans showed overwhelming opposition to efforts *PRO* to curb dog - meat consumption just because it offends foreigners.
Ultimate Corp. signed a letter of intent *PRO* to market Hewlett - Packard Co. minicomputers, the companies said 0 *T*-1.
Ultimate expects the 3 1/2 - year agreement to generate $100 million *U* in sales, but it wouldn't estimate profit.
Under terms of the pact, Ultimate, a computer - systems concern, will market the full line of HP 9000 series 800 multipleuser minicomputers.
Hewlett - Packard is based *-1 in Palo Alto, Calif.
Switzerland's most famous raider says 0 he isn't one.
Werner K. Rey believes 0 fortunes are made *-1 by *PRO* being friendly.
And in little more than a decade of *PRO* being friendly--and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S. - style wheeling and dealing--the 46 - year - old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire.
He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for *PRO*-1 getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies.
His latest coup: September's masterminding of the five billion Swiss - franc ($3.07 billion *U*) merger between Adia S.A., the world's second - largest temporary employment agency, and Inspectorate International S.A., a Rey - controlled product - inspection company.
Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November.
But approval is almost certain since Mr. Rey and a friendly Adia management are in control.
After the transaction, Mr. Rey estimates 0 the value of his 20% stake in the new company, 0 *T*-2 to be held *-1 by his Omni Holding AG, will be about 1 billion Swiss francs.
This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs.
Mr. Rey bought a controlling stake in Inspectorate for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982, *PRO*-1 building up the little - known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions.
"I like *PRO*-1 to succeed," says *T*-3 Mr. Rey during a recent morning of *PRO* working at home, which he also likes *T*-2.
Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake Geneva and a low - slung house whose rooms *T*-1 overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps.
In the corner of his reception room is *T*-1 a delicate antique desk piled * high with dossiers.
There is a small Renoir on the wall.
Zurich - based magazine Bilanz lists Mr. Rey as *PRO*-1 having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs.
Writes *ICH*-1 Bilanz: "No one in Switzerland ever came so far so fast ...
He was simply the first in this country 0 *T*-2 to realize that treasures were just lying around *PRO*-3 waiting *PRO*-4 to be picked *-1 up.
In short: Rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets."
However, the Swiss financial press in general, as well as many analysts, have had a hard time *PRO* making up their minds about Mr. Rey and his un-Swiss ways.
For Switzerland's most prestigious newspaper, Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Mr. Rey seems destined *PRO*-2 to remain the "former Bally raider," an image that *T*-1 has proved hard 0 *PRO* to overcome *T*-3.
In 1976, as an upstart in the eyes of Switzerland's establishment, Mr. Rey laid the foundations of his present - day prominence with an unheard - of raid on Bally, the country's traditional shoemaker.
*PRO*-1 Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in London, where he was working as a financial consultant *T*-2, he learned that a large packet of Bally's shares was up for sale.
*PRO*-2 Looking into Bally, he could hardly believe what he saw *T*-1: a company with enormous real - estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs; it had 7,000 employees.
*PRO*-1 Investing four million Swiss francs earned * from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife, Mr. Rey acquired 20% of Bally's shares.
But such tactics were alien to Switzerland in 1976, and still aren't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed *PRO*-2 to maintain *T*-1.
Eventually, Mr. Rey was forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker Oerlikon - Buehrle Holding AG as establishment pressure *ICH*-2 grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys' network.
Mr. Rey made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale.
"Bally was not an unfriendly takeover," he insists *T*-1.
*PRO* Buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible, Mr. Rey contends 0 *T*-1.
"I bought from willing shareholders."
Nevertheless, Mr. Rey has been very careful since then *PRO* to make sure 0 his moves are welcome.
And he has worked *PRO*-1 to shed his raider image.
In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve, based * in Thun.
With the nonferrous metals business undermined *-1 in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs, this looked like a dull undertaking.
But Mr. Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country's major producers; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry.
Three years later, machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was *-1 to become part of the Rey empire.
Once again the company's future looked less than rosy.
But after restructuring under new management, the profits began rolling in.
A major boost to Mr. Rey's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks *T*-1.
They renamed it *PRO*-2 Swiss Cantobank and are using it *PRO*-1 to expand abroad.
In 1987, Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses *PRO*-1 to take over Switzerland's Jean Frey AG, a major producer of magazines and newspapers.
And with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur - based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight.
Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti, whose secretive raid on the company's stock *T*-1 had led to a bitter battle.
Meanwhile, as such strategic investments have mounted, the merchant - banking arm of Mr. Rey's Omni Holding has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies, often after a financial or corporate restructuring.
Today, this branch of Mr. Rey's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate.
In its portfolio are *T*-2 such diverse companies as United Kingdom - based Air Europe; Checkrobot Inc., a U.S. company that *T*-1 makes supermarket checkout machines; Norment Industries, a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems; Com Systems Inc., a U.S. regional telephone company; and major real - estate projects in the U.S. and Europe.
For financial analysts, *PRO*-1 reading Omni's accounts is a tough challenge.
"Companies move in and out," says *T*-1 Helga Kern of KK Swiss Investment.
Financial analysts note that Mr. Rey is attracted *-1 to companies that *T*-3 are undervalued *-2 on the basis of their real - estate interests.
In August, Omni unexpectedly bought Inspectorate's 80% stake in Harpener AG of West Germany, a land - rich company.
The internal transaction within the Rey empire puzzled Harpener's small shareholders, but analysts say 0 it *EXP*-1 makes sense for Inspectorate - Adia to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help.
Mr. Rey says 0 the move is yet another example of his conservatism.
He explains that companies with real estate give "security."
The real estate can be used *-1, he points out 0 *?*, as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development.
He says 0 he wants *PRO*-1 to "influence" but not "manage" companies.
"I don't want *PRO*-1 to be like {financier Alan} Bond and the other Australians.
I don't want companies to be built *-1 around me as a person.
I want them to stand alone.
The Belgian consumer price index rose a provisional 0.1% in October from the previous month and was up 3.64% from October 1988, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said 0 *T*-1.
The index, which *T*-2 uses a base of 1981 as 100, was calculated *-1 at 140.91 points in October, from 140.74 in September.
Annual inflation rose to 3.64% in October from 3.55% in September.
Belgium's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year, but the ministry said 0 the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August.
Joseph L. Dionne, chairman *RNR*-2 and chief executive officer *RNR*-2 of McGraw - Hill Inc., was elected *-1 to the board of directors of this electronics manufacturer.
He succeeds the retiring James W. Wilcock.
When Westinghouse Electric Corp. shuttered its massive steam turbine plant in Lester, Pa., three years ago *T*-1, it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its century - old power generation business.
But now Westinghouse is enjoying a resurgence in demand for both steam and combustion turbines and may even join the growing legion of independent electric producers.
And with its new venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., announced * last week, it is poised *PRO*-1 to penetrate growing markets overseas.
For the first time since the mid-1970s, Westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants.
Most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities, and Westinghouse believes 0 it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years.
Analysts agree, *PRO*-1 predicting that the revived market could significantly boost Westinghouse's bottom line in coming years.
"Westinghouse's earnings could be materially enhanced *-2 in the mid-1990s or sooner," says *T*-1 Russell L. Leavitt, of Salomon Brothers Inc.
The company expects a need for 140,000 megawatts of new generation in the U.S. over the next decade.
Already this year, it has received orders for four 150 - megawatt advanced combustion turbines from Florida Power & Light Co. and for two 300 - megawatt plants from Intercontinental Energy Corp., among others.
Westinghouse's own role as a supplier also is changing.
In the past, the company usually took token equity positions in power plants 0 it supplied *T*-1 as a "kicker" *PRO*-2 to close deals.
But last June's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million *U* 0 *PRO* to build a new 55 - megawatt plant *T*-1 could herald a new age.
Westinghouse's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co.
"We haven't decided on a strategy yet, but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we're the developer or just the supplier," says *T*-1 Theodore Stern, executive vice president of the company's energy and utility systems group.
At the same time, Westinghouse hopes 0 its venture with Mitsubishi will help *PRO*-1 fend off growing competition, particularly in the U.S., from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG, Siemens AG, and British General Electric Co.
Under the agreement, Westinghouse will be able *PRO*-1 to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner, and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment.
Westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with Misubishi, *PRO* giving it an edge in developing Asian markets.
In addition, the two companies will develop new steam turbine technology, such as the plants ordered * by Florida Power, and even utilize each other's plants at times *PRO*-1 to take advantage of currency fluctuations.
"Even though we'll still compete against Mitsubishi, we can also work jointly on some projects, and we'll gain a lot of sourcing flexibility," Mr. Stern contends *T*-1.
The Westinghouse - Mitsubishi venture was designed *-1 as a non-equity transaction, circumventing any possible antitrust concerns.
Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement because the Justice Department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam turbine joint venture with Asea Brown Boveri.
It is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled *-2 primarily by independent producers which, unlike utilities, *T*-3 aren't regulated *-1 and therefore don't need government approval *PRO*-1 to construct new plants.
Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years.
Despite shutdowns of the company's Lester and East Pittsburgh plants, the company believes 0 it has sufficient capacity 0 *PRO* to meet near - term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in North Carolina *T*-1.
Still, Westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could evaporate if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities, which *T*-2 have been pressured by regulators *-1 *PRO*-4 to keep down rates, are suddenly freed *PRO*-3 to add significant generating capacity.
Even if that scenario occurs, Westinghouse figures 0 it is prepared *-1.
The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it hasn't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade.
John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer, says 0 he expects a commercial order *ICH*-2 by 1995 for the company's AP600 nuclear power plant, which *T*-1 is under development.
"Once we see an order, we expect 0 it'll be on line by 2000.
R.H. Macy & Co., the closely held department store chain, said in a financial filing Friday that its sales for the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 29 were up 10% to $1.59 billion *U* against $1.44 billion *U* a year earlier.
Comparable store sales for the quarter were up 7.3%.
The net loss for the quarter was $43.1 million *U* against a year - earlier loss of $106 million *U*.
The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations.
For the year, sales were up 5.6% to $6.97 billion *U* compared with $6.61 billion *U* in fiscal 1988.
Sales for both years reflect 12 - month performances for each year of I. Magnin, Bullock's, and Bullocks Wilshire.
Macy acquired those three businesses in May 1988.
On a comparable store basis, including the new acquisitions for both years, sales for fiscal 1989 were up 1.9%.
Macy reported a net loss for fiscal 1989 of $53.7 million *U* compared with a net loss of $188.2 million *U* for fiscal 1988.
The company's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, which bondholders use *T*-1 a measurement of the chain's ability *PRO* to pay its existing debt, increased 11% in fiscal 1989 to $926.1 million *U* from $833.6 million *U*.
The $833.6 million *U* figures includes the new acquisitions.
Excluding those businesses, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for 1988 would have been $728.5 million *U*.
As of Feb. 1, 1990, the Bullocks Wilshire stores will operate as I. Magnin stores.
Altogether, Macy and its subsidiaries own or lease 149 department stores and 61 specialty stores nationwide.
Although management led a leveraged buy - out of R.H. Macy in July 1986, the company still makes financial filings because of its publicly traded debt.
The company estimates its total debt at about $5.2 billion *U*.
This includes $4.6 billion *U* of long - term debt, $457.5 million *U* in short - term debt, and $95.7 million *U* of the current portion of long - term debt.
In a letter to investors, Chairman Edward S. Finkelstein wrote that he expects the company to "benefit from some of the disruption faced * by our competitors.
While our competitors are concerned *-1 with their financial viability and possible ownership changes, we will be concentrating on *PRO*-3 buying and selling merchandise 0 our customers need and want *T*-2."
Mr. Finkelstein is apparently referring to B. Altman and Bonwit Teller, two New York retailers that *T*-1 have recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as well as the retail chains owned * by financially troubled Campeau Corp.
Those chains include Bloomingdale's, which Campeau recently said 0 it will sell *T*-1.
Other retail properties for sale include Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field, retailers now owned * by B.A.T PLC, the British tobacco conglomerate.
In his letter, Mr. Finkelstein also referred to the recent San Francisco earthquake.
Mr. Finkelstein flew to San Francisco the day after the earthquake, and found that 10 to 12 of his company's stores had sustained some damage, including the breakage of most windows at the I. Magnin store on Union Square.
"The volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive, but *PRO*-1 looking at the whole fiscal year, we don't see the effect as material," wrote *T*-2 Mr. Finkelstein.
Air & Water Technologies Corp. completed the acquisition of Falcon Associates Inc., a Bristol, Pa., asbestos - abatement concern, for $25 million *U* of stock.
Air & Water, which *T*-1 provides environmental services and systems, paid about 1.4 million of its shares for Falcon.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Air & Water closed unchanged at $17.50 *U*.
At July 31, Air & Water had nearly 10 million shares outstanding.
*PRO*-1 Upset over the use of what it says 0 *T*-2 are its exclusive trademarks, Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp. is fighting back--in court.
Concord New Horizons Corp., creators of a 1988 movie called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Nam Angels, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization, the not - for - profit corporation says 0 *T*-1 in a complaint filed * in federal court.
Nam Angels depicts a group of the cycle gang's members on a mercenary mission to Viet Nam during the war years.
In addition to *PRO*-2 being broadcast *-1 on cable television, the movie also is being distributed *-2 on videocassettes, the suit alleges 0 *T*-3 in *PRO*-4 seeking unspecified damages.
Also named *-2 in the suit is *T*-1 Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City, Calif., its parent, Heron Communications Inc., and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles, holders of the copyright on the movie.
A Concord spokeswoman called the suit "*PRO*-2 unfounded" but declined *PRO*-1 to comment further.
Besides *T*-1 being upset with the film's use of the Hells Angels name and logos, the Angels are angry with their depiction in the movie.
"There is absolutely no way 0 our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie *T*-2," said *T*-1 George Christie, president of the club's Ventura chapter.
"Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization--loyalty and trust."
Nam Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as *PRO*-3 showing no remorse when a member is killed *-1 *T*-2.
Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels, Mr. Christie said 0 *T*-1.
Hells Angels was formed *-1 in 1948 and incorporated *-1 in 1966.
In addition to 26 chapters in the U.S., there are 40 chapters in foreign countries.
The closely held supermarket chain named Frank Nicastro *PRO*-1 vice president and treasurer.
The 47 - year - old Mr. Nicastro joins Grand Union from Singer Co., where he was treasurer *T*-1.
Several of the New York Stock Exchange's own listed companies, led * by giant Contel Corp., are joining for the first time *PRO*-1 to complain about program trading and the exchange's role in it.
*PRO*-1 Claiming 0 program trading has turned the Big Board into a "gambling casino," Contel Chairman Charles Wohlstetter said that he and at least 20 other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance.
The group, Mr. Wohlstetter said 0 *?* in an interview, wants *PRO*-3 to end the market's wild price swings that critics blame *T*-1 on computer - aided program - trading strategies.
The group will complain to Washington, to the heads of program - trading firms and to the heads of the Big Board itself, he said 0 *T*-1.
"They should call {the exchange} *PRO*-3 Trump East," charged *T*-2 Mr. Wohlstetter, the 79 - year - old founder of Contel who *T*-1's also a former investment banker and stock trader.
"What is the mission of the financial community *T*-1 --
*PRO* to help some scavengers or schemers, or help corporate America?"
Contel is a $6 billion *U* telephone and electronics company.
Pressure *ICH*-2 has been building on the Big Board in the past two weeks *PRO* to do something about market volatility, which many investors say 0 *PRO*-3 is caused *-1 by program trading.
The market's Friday - the - 13th plunge of 190 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Big Board's understated response to it, galvanized some longstanding dissatisfaction among companies listed * on the exchange.
Last month, program trading accounted for a record 13.8% of average daily Big Board volume.
Mr. Wohlstetter, for example, said 0 he wrote to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. about program trading after the 190 - point Dow plunge, and as in previous queries, "what I get *T*-1 back is gobbledygook."
He said 0 he's upset that Mr. Phelan, *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to calm investors after the plunge, said that investors would simply have *-3 to get used to the market's big price swings.
The Big Board "is partly *-2 to blame *-3 {for the price swings}, because they're cowards," said *T*-1 Mr. Wohlstetter.
"Their powerful members manage them."
The focus of the outcry has been stock - index arbitrage, which *T*-1 accounts for about half the program trading that *T*-2 goes on.
Index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets, but critics say 0 such trading accelerates market movements and increases the chance for a crash.
The Big Board has refused *PRO*-2 to be drawn *-1 into a public debate about program trading.
Richard Grasso, Big Board president, last week said only that the exchange is concerned *-1 about all its constituents.
Privately, exchange officials worry that without a hospitable system for program trading at the Big Board, billions of dollars in trading will simply migrate to overseas exchanges such as London's.
It is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began *-3 trading in its own stock "basket" product that *T*-2 allows big investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index in a single trade.
One intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers, according to the exchange.
Investors have complained for some time about program trading, particularly index arbitrage, to little avail.
But according to some Big Board traders, an organized campaign from exchange - listed companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes.
"They won't fight the listed companies.
Now the assault is on," said *T*-1 one top trader.
The Big Board can't ban stock - index futures, of course, but it could ban use of its high - speed electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms *PRO*-1 to back off.
The exchange put a bit of a damper on program trading when, last year, it simply started *-1 to publish monthly statistics of each firm's program - trading volume *T*-2.
Contel's Mr. Wohlstetter said 0 the group of Big Board companies isn't ready *PRO*-1 to go public yet with its effort, and that he doesn't plan *PRO*-2 to be the leader once it is public.
However, he said 0 he planned *PRO*-1 to spend the weekend *PRO*-2 making calls *PRO*-2 to gather additional support.
Among those 0 Mr. Wohlstetter said 0 he has been talking to *T*-2 are *T*-3 Sanford Weill of Primerica Corp., which *T*-1 is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.; GTE Corp.'s James Johnson, and ITT Corp.'s Rand Araskog.
None of these chief executives were available for comment.
Among the targets of the Big Board companies' campaign will be *T*-2 some corporate pension funds that *T*-1 use program - trading strategies *PRO*-3 to maximize returns on their investments.
For Contel's part, the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program - trading firms.
It was just those kinds of ultimatums that *T*-1 last week succeeded in *PRO*-2 turning up the heat in the debate.
Kemper Corp.'s Kemper Financial Services unit said 0 it cut off Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, Oppenheimer and General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit.
All of the firms except Kidder, which *T*-1 is the second - biggest program trader on Wall Street, quickly announced pull - backs from index arbitrage.
Kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of Kidder's own brokers, he believes 0 index arbitrage doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole.
" However, pressure on Kidder's parent, GE, could change Kidder's policy.
GE Chairman John Welch has been "besieged with phone calls" complaining about his unit's program trading, according to a person close to him.
Joseph P. Jordan, 52 years old, becomes president *RNR*-1, chief executive officer *RNR*-1 and a director *RNR*-1 of the bank company.
Mr. Jordan, formerly president *RNR*-2 and chief executive *RNR*-2 of Fishkill National Bank in Beacon, N.Y., succeeds Donald Broderick, who *T*-1 died at 52 in an automobile accident.
If a TV weatherman gets butterflies *PRO*-1 facing the camera again after a questionable forecast, Donald H. Straszheim surely understands.
The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since *PRO* backpedaling on a major prediction.
Mr. Straszheim expects 0 he will take some heat, and he's right.
Since the last time 0 he traveled this way *T*-1 several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession.
In February 1988, for example, Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely *-1 to fall into recession in early 1989."
The forecasts were widely disseminated *-2, and, in a splashy ad campaign launched * in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors *PRO*-1 to buy bonds.
It said 0 long - term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which *T*-1 benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy.
The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%.
But this September--just when many market economists, including some at Merrill Lynch, believed that Mr. Straszheim was about *-2 to be proved *-1 right *T*-3--he took a detour if not a U-turn.
He softened the talk about a recession.
Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed * by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter.
And, just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%.
While such changes might sound minor, they aren't *?*: Merrill Lynch manages or oversees some $300 billion *U* in retail accounts that *T*-2 include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities.
Two well - known colleagues who *T*-1 believe 0 Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling, both of whom *T*-2 run their own New York research firms.
Mr. Bostian said in August that his macroeconomic index signaled recession.
Mr. Shilling, who *T*-1 was Merrill Lynch's chief economist from 1967 to 1971, has heralded a recession for months.
"My own personal opinion is that Don threw in the towel just about the time 0 he should have doubled his bet *T*-2," he says *T*-1.
Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy.
And Mr. Straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that "it *EXP*-3 may prove *-2 to be the case that we got whipsawed *-1--that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time."
He adds, "That's the forecasting business."
However risky the business *T*-1, it's brisk these days.
*PRO*-2 Pestered *-1 by bosses, brokers, clients and media people and pushed *-1 by their own egos, Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator.
But the surprisingly durable seven - year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast.
This isn't the quiet economic science practiced * in the universities.
This is the commercial version.
*PRO*-2 Carrying the new message on the road, Mr. Straszheim meets confrontation that *T*-1 often occurs in inverse proportion to the size of the client.
No sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time.
Some smaller clients don't seem *-1 to notice his switch.
But with some clients, the talk can heat up a bit.
Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, *PRO*-1 waiting for an opportunity *PRO* to ask about the forecast.
A good half - hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate after Mr. Straszheim says something about people who *T*-1 believe 0 interest rates are about *-2 to nosedive.
"I'm one of them who *T*-1 hope 0 they will *?*, with $6 billion *U* in debt on the books.
Is that the forecast?" Mr. O'Brien asks *T*-1, *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-3 to pin down the economist.
He doesn't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest - rate scenarios.
In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem *-1 ready *PRO*-2 to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.
Alfred Harrison, the manager, shoves Mr. Straszheim's handout back at him: "Do we want *PRO*-1 to go through this?
Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about *-1 to be right *T*-3 *T*-2?"
*PRO*-1 Swiveling in his chair, Mr. Straszheim replies that the new outlook, though *PRO*-2 still weak, doesn't justify *PRO* calling a recession right now . "
It's all in this handout 0 you don't want *PRO*-1 to look at *T*-2.
We could still have a recession" at some point.
One of Mr. Straszheim's recurring themes is that the state of the economy isn't a simple black or white.
Sometimes, like now, it's gray.
This somewhat - ambiguous assessment moves one Alliance portfolio manager *PRO*-2 to ask: "So, what *T*-1 is this--a Stealth recession?"
Another challenges Merrill Lynch's bond recommendation last year.
"We're not running that ad campaign any more," Mr. Straszheim snaps *T*-1 in a rare show of irritation.
He adds, "I think 0 it was a fairly decent call."
*PRO*-2 Explaining his change of mind, Mr. Straszheim says later, "It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to pin this on one factor."
He says 0 the economy, and especially the employment numbers, look much better than he expected *?*; interest rates have generally declined; inflation hasn't run amok.
"Our business is constantly looking at all these things," he says *T*-1.
His new forecast calls for "a soft landing."
And it may be right, *PRO* judging from last week's report that inflation - adjusted gross national product rose at a 2.5% annual rate in the third quarter.
Mr. Shilling understands Mr. Straszheim's problems.
"There's unbelievable pressure *ICH*-2 on economists *PRO* to forecast these numbers," he says *T*-1 . "
You make a forecast, and then you become its prisoner."
It *EXP*-2 is indeed hard *PRO* to back away from a widely publicized forecast, and Mr. Straszheim is fidgeting with the handcuffs on this trip.
His approach to the recantation is direct but low - key.
"For some time, we had forecast negative third - and fourth - quarter growth.
We pulled that forecast," he begins matter - of - factly *T*-1 in a meeting with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. officials in Minneapolis, the first stop.
In the aftermath of the Beijing massacre on June 4, economists advanced wildly divergent views on how Hong Kong would be affected *-1 *T*-2.
Among the most upbeat was *T*-1 BT Brokerage (Asia) Ltd.
In a June 5 reaction, the Bankers Trust Co. unit proclaimed the economy "shockproof."
Others were more cautious.
In a July analysis titled *PRO* "*PRO*-1 From Euphoria to Despair," W.I. Carr (Far East) Ltd., another securities firm, said that eroding confidence might undermine future economic development.
Today, with business activity in Hong Kong staggering along at an uneven pace, the economy itself seems *-1 locked *-2 in a struggle between hope and fear.
Manufacturers have survived the turmoil in China *PRO*-1 largely unscathed.
Signs of revival seem *-1 evident in Hong Kong's hard - hit hotel sector.
But in the stock and real - estate markets, activity remains spotty even though prices have regained much of their lost ground.
Waning demand reported * by importers, retailers and even fancy restaurants all reinforce a profile of a community that *T*-1 is sharply tightening its belt.
As many economists and businessmen see it, those incongruities underscore a paradox that *T*-1 seems *-2 likely *PRO*-3 to bedevil the economy throughout the 1990s.
That paradox is Hong Kong's economically rewarding yet politically perilous relationship with China.
As a model of capitalist efficiency on southern China's doorstep, Hong Kong's prospects look good.
China's land and labor offer inexpensive alternatives to local industry.
China - bound freight streams through the territory's port.
In the decade since the communist nation emerged from isolation, its burgeoning trade with the West has lifted Hong Kong's status as a regional business center.
These benefits seem *-1 secure despite China's current economic and political troubles.
But to Hong Kong, China isn't purely business.
It is also the sovereign power that, come 1997, *T*-1 will take over this British colony.
China's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong.
That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force *PRO*-1 to crush their nation's democracy movement.
Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s.
A widely held assumption all along has been that, given its robust economy, Hong Kong will be able *PRO*-1 to attract sufficient foreign money and talent *PRO*-2 to comfortably offset the outflows.
With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4, that assumption no longer seems *-1 so safe.
Investment and emigration plans take time *PRO*-1 to come to fruition.
Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre, and few are prepared *PRO*-1 to predict its ultimate impact.
The only consensus is that more money and people *ICH*-2 may leave Hong Kong than *PRO* had been thought *-1 likely.
This expected blow has cast a pall over the economy's prospects.
The question, as many people see it, is how long such uncertainty will last *T*-1.
Maureen Fraser, an economist with W.I. Carr, a subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, believes that the territory may not be able *PRO*-1 to regain its momentum until some time after 1997.
It may experience an upswing or two in between.
But with local investors shaken *-1 by China's political and economic turmoil, she says 0 *?*, a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty.
"Investors have *-1 to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997," she says *T*-2.
"Over the next few years, I would advise caution."
In a *PRO* soon - to - be published *-1 book on the territory, a political economist, Miron Mushkat, has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 Hong Kong government officials and businessmen.
Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong's uneasy relationship with China will constrain *RNR*-1--though not inhibit *RNR*-1--long - term economic growth.
The rest are split *-1 roughly between optimists who *T*-2 expect Hong Kong to hum along as *PRO*-4 *?* before and pessimists who *T*-3 foresee irreparable chaos.
The interviews took place two years ago.
Since the China crisis erupted, Mr. Mushkat says 0 *?*, the scenario as 0 *PRO*-4 depicted *-3 by the middle - of - the - road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties 0 Hong Kong currently faces *T*-1.
The consensus of this group, which he dubs *T*-1 "*PRO*-2 realists," is that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3% and 5% *U*.
Such a pace of growth, though *PRO*-1 respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for Hong Kong.
Only twice since the 1960s has annual gross domestic product growth here fallen below 5% for two or more consecutive years.
The first instance occurred in 1967 - 68, when China's Cultural Revolution triggered bloody street rioting in the colony *T*-1.
The other came in 1974 - 75 from the combined shock of world recession and a severe local stock market crash.
During the past 10 years, Hong Kong's economic growth has averaged 8.3% annually.
Given Hong Kong's record, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago *T*-2.
Under the current circumstances, he says 0 *?*, their scenario no longer seems *-1 unrealistic.
"The city could lose some of its entrepreneurial flavor.
It could lose some of its dynamism," says *T*-1 Mr. Mushkat, a director of Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of Britain's Barings PLC . "
It doesn't have *-1 to be a disaster.
It just means that Hong Kong would become a less exciting place."
*PRO*-2 Going by official forecasts of GDP, which *T*-1 measures the colony's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" seem *-2 relatively close to the mark.
After *PRO*-1 taking into account the fallout from the China crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%.
The updated forecast, published * Aug. 25, compares with an earlier forecast of 6% published * March 1 and a 7.4% rate achieved * in
Sir Piers Jacobs, Hong Kong's financial secretary, says 0 a further downward revision may be justified *-1 unless the economy stages a more convincing rally.
"We aren't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario," he says *T*-1.
"But clearly we're entering a difficult period."
Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong's economy.
One concerns Japanese investors.
*PRO*-1 Barely visible on Hong Kong's property scene in 1985, by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor, *PRO*-1 spending $602 million *U*.
The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis.
But if the Japanese return in force, their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors' waning commitment.
Another--and critical--factor is the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest export market.
Even before the China crisis, weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth.
Conversely, strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped *PRO*-1 propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate.
Indeed, a few economists maintain that global forces will continue *-1 to govern Hong Kong's economic rhythm.
Once external conditions, such as U.S. demand, swing in the territory's favor, they argue 0 *?*, local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue *-2 doing business as usual.
But economic arguments, however solid, won't necessarily impress Hong Kong's 5.7 million people.
Many are refugees, *PRO*-1 having fled China's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
As a result, many of those now planning *PRO* to leave Hong Kong can't easily be swayed *-1 by momentary improvements in the colony's political and economic climate.
Emigration applications soared in 1985, when Britain and China ratified their accord on Hong Kong's future *T*-1.
In 1987, Hong Kong's most prosperous year for a decade, 30,000 *ICH*-1 left, up 58% from the previous year.
Last year, 45,000 went.
The government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as 60,000--a projection that *T*-1 is widely regarded *-2 as unrealistically low.
A large number of those leaving are managers and professionals.
While no one professes *PRO*-1 to know the exact cost of such a "brain drain" to the economy, hardly anyone doubts that it poses a threat.
"When the economy loses a big portion of its work force that *T*-2 also happens *-6 to include its most productive members *T*-5, economic growth is bound *-3 to be affected *-1," says *T*-4 Anthong Wong, an economist with Hang Seng Bank.
Ogilvy & Mather, whose declining profitability *T*-1 prompted its takeover by WPP Group earlier this year, will see its profit margins bounce back to the "11.5% range" in 1990, said 0 *T*-2 Graham Phillips, the agency's new chairman - elect.
The ad agency's pretax profit margins were slightly under 10% at the time of the takeover, according to analysts; London - based WPP's goal is *PRO* to increase margins to 12%.
Mr. Phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency.
*PRO*-1 British - born, the 24 - year Ogilvy veteran was named last week *-1 *PRO*-4 to succeed Kenneth Roman, who *T*-2 is leaving by year's end *PRO*-3 to take a top post at American Express, an Ogilvy client.
*PRO*-2 Surrounded *-1 by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. Phillips laid out several changes 0 he hopes *PRO*-3 to make *T*-4 at the agency.
First and foremost, Mr. Phillips said 0 he hopes *PRO*-1 to improve client service.
Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as *PRO*-3 occasionally being high - handed in its treatment of clients, of *PRO*-3 preaching what strategy a client should *RNR*-2--indeed, must *RNR*-2--follow *T*-1.
And some of its top client - service executives, including Mr. Phillips, were promoted *-1 to the point 0 they were saddled *-2 with administrative duties *T*-4, with little time 0 *PRO* to see clients *T*-3.
But Mr. Phillips recently freed himself up *PRO*-1 to spend more time with clients by *PRO*-1 delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy.
He also plans *PRO*-1 to get *PRO*-2 to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to *T*-3, such as Lever Brothers, American Express and Seagram.
The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients *PRO*-1 to attempt *PRO*-2 to smoothly hand over the reins.
"Clients want *PRO*-2 to see more of our senior people involved * in the business--not once a month, but two or three times a week," he said *T*-1.
Mr. Phillips also hopes *PRO*-1 to finally implement a reorganization announced * earlier this year but put * on hold by the WPP takeover.
The reorganization is supposed *-1 to make one - stop shopping--*PRO* buying advertising, public relations and design all in one place, or "Ogilvy Orchestration" in Ogilvyspeak--a reality.
Under the reorganization, Ogilvy plans *PRO*-1 to name one executive on each account as a "client service director" 0 *T*-2 to work as the client's single contact for all those services.
"There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus," Mr. Phillips complained *T*-2 to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced *-1 *T*-3.
Now Mr. Phillips says 0 he hopes *PRO*-1 to have the new system in place for several clients--including American Express, American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder--by year's end.
Industry executives and analysts are divided *-1 on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task.
He isn't as well - known to clients as is *?* Mr. Roman.
Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new - business record for more than a year.
And while last week the agency hired a top Chiat / Day / Mojo executive, Bill Hamilton, 0 *T*-4 to try *PRO*-1 to bolster its work, "Graham has *-2 to get the revenue of that New York office moving," says *T*-3 James Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities.
The one thing 0 Mr. Phillips clearly does have *T*-1 going for him is continuity, although it *EXP*-2 isn't certain if that will be enough.
As Mr. Dougherty says *?*, "The last thing 0 they need *T*-1 is enormous disruption at the top...and Graham is obviously a long - term member of the Ogilvy Mafia, 0 as we call it *PRO*-3 *T*-2."
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style.
While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman, Mr. Phillips would rather delegate, *PRO* leaving him time for his interests outside the office.
Mr. Roman, by contrast, seems *-1 rarely to cut loose at all, although he did appear at Ogilvy's Halloween party Friday *PRO*-2 decked out in duck feet and a duck hat, *PRO*-3 costumed as a "lame duck."
Mr. Phillips said 0 the company's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable, given that the company's profitability was dragged *-1 down this year by an expensive move to luxurious, oversized new New York headquarters.
The move, budgeted * at about $7 million *U*, actually came in at about $10 million *U*, he said 0 *T*-1.
But margins will be helped *-1, too, by some other cost - saving steps.
Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff, closed the executive dining room and, after the takeover, let go half a dozen financial executives.
WPP, which *T*-1 assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands - on way, instituted a new financial system and plans *PRO*-2 to sublet some floors in Ogilvy's new headquarters building to outsiders.
The fact that the agency will now be part of a U.K. company, under British accounting rules, will also make the profit picture look better.
Y&R's Klein Steps Down
Arthur Klein, president of Young & Rubicam's New York office, stepped down "temporarily" in the wake of charges *ICH*-2 by a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn., that he, the agency and another top executive bribed Jamaican tourist officials *PRO*-1 to win its account in 1981.
In an internal memo, Alex Kroll, the agency's chairman, said 0 Mr. Klein decided *PRO*-1 to remove himself *PRO*-1 to minimize "negative reaction" from prospective clients and others and *PRO*-1 to prepare for his defense.
"The fact that he is in the process of *PRO*-2 defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R," Mr. Kroll wrote *T*-1.
He said 0 Mr. Klein will return to his post at the end of the trial "at which he will be vindicated *-1 *T*-2."
Mr. Klein will work with Mr. Kroll on some of the agency's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending.
Peter Georgescu, president of Y&R's ad operations, will assume Mr. Klein's day - to - day role.
Wells Rich's New Partner
Wells, Rich, Greene named Cheryl Heller as an executive vice president *RNR*-2 and creative partner *RNR*-2 in its image group, which *T*-1 concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising.
Ms. Heller, 38, had headed up Boston agency Heller / Breene, a unit of WCRS.
The agency, with about $35 million *U* in billings, will be dissolved *-1, with some of its staffers absorbed * by WCRS's Della Femina McNamee unit in Boston, Ms. Heller said 0 *T*-2.
She said 0 it was too early *PRO* to say what *T*-1 would happen to its clients, including Reebok and Apple.
At Wells Rich, Ms. Heller will concentrate on accounts that *T*-1 include Philip Morris's Benson & Hedges cigarette brand, which *T*-2 relies on print ads, Ms. Heller's specialty.
As *PRO* previously reported *-1, the account is troubled, with Philip Morris asking Backer Spielvogel Bates, Ogilvy & Mather, and possibly others to try their hand at *PRO*-2 developing new creative work.
Wells Rich declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the status of the account, as did *?* the other agencies.
Like so many trends in the entertainment industry, the current spate of rape dramas on television seems *-1 to represent a confluence of high - mindedness and self - interest.
The former comes from the latest wave of political activism in Hollywood, especially around feminist issues such as abortion.
The latter comes from the perception *ICH*-1, on the part of many people in network TV, that their only hope of *PRO* keeping viewers from *PRO*-2 defecting to cable is *PRO* to fill the airwaves with an increasingly raw sensationalism.
*PRO* Put these together, and you get programs about rape.
The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town.
In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne - Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss.
Because the show has acquired a sense of place by *PRO* being filmed *-1 on location in Georgia, this episode--in which Althea gets raped *-2 by an arrogant white schoolteacher *T*-3--does a decent job of *PRO*-4 tracing the social repercussions of the crime.
Obviously, it *EXP*-1's harder *PRO* to establish a sense of place in a one - shot TV movie.
But tonight's offering, "*PRO* Settle the Score" (9 - 11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try *?*.
This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home *PRO* to find the man who *T*-2 raped her 20 years earlier is supposed *-3 to be set *-1 in the Ozarks.
But it's more like an illustration of what *ICH*-2 Ben Stein describes *T*-1 in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: "Fear of violence and animosity...because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small - town people...produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers."
The writer *RNR*-3 and executive producer *RNR*-3 of "*PRO* Settle the Score," Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who *T*-1 participated in a PBS documentary, aired * this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation *T*-2.
At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who *T*-1 is Jewish, says 0 he felt rejected *-3 by many of the Protestants and Southerners 0 he met *T*-2 at Yale.
He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy 0 we Southerners can't stand *T*-1.
" Mr. Sohmer confesses that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America *T*-1."
But is exile in Hollywood enough?
*PRO* Not to judge by "*PRO* Settle the Score," in which Mr. Sohmer seems *-1 to be settling a score of his own *T*-2.
Of all the unflattering portraits of small - town America 0 I've seen *T*-1 on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty.
The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of *PRO*-2 having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence *T*-1 consists mostly of *PRO* growing peaches and repressing sex.
I mean, 0 these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen - ager *T*-1, someone tied her hands behind her back, thrust her head into a gunny sack, brutally raped and beat her, and then left her *PRO*-2 to die in a cold - storage room.
Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while *PRO*-3 saying grace at the supper table, *T*-4 pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter 0 he hasn't seen *T*-2 for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what *T*-1 happened in the cold - storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago.
People like Pa do exist, of course.
But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg.
Every man 0 Kate encounters *T*-1 is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three.
*PRO* Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that *T*-1 doesn't resemble small - town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small - town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," 0 *T*-2 itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie.
There are two exceptions: Josh (Jeffrey DeMunn), the local doctor who *T*-1 has always loved Kate; and Lincoln (Richard Masur), Kate's simple - minded but affectionate brother.
Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear *T*-1, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.
How could he be *?* *T*-1?
He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter.
As for Lincoln, if you can't guess why he's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her *T*-1 *T*-3, then I'm not going *-2 to tell you.
As for the women, they're pathetic.
Kate's Ma (Louise Latham) is a moral coward.
Her sister - in - law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named *PRO* *PRO*-7 Tucker, whose idea of fun *T*-2 is *-3 to leave his wife at home *PRO*-5 tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies Kate into a dance that *T*-1 consists of *PRO* drooling on her while *PRO*-4 trying *PRO*-6 to break her ribs.
At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm.
Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of "*PRO* Settle the Score."
In the aforementioned episode of "In the Heat of the Night," we saw Althea being attacked *-1, but we weren't invited *-2 *-3 *PRO*-4 to enjoy the spectacle.
In Mr. Sohmer's film, by contrast, we are urged *-1 *-2 *PRO*-3 to share the perverse excitement of the rapist creeping up on his victim, as the camera ogles Kate in various stages of undress and lingers on the sight of her trussed - up body during frequent flashbacks to the rape.
At this point, the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy.
*PRO* Take the scene in which Kate stands *PRO*-1 naked by a lighted window, *PRO*-1 whispering to her hidden assailant, "*PRO* Look all 0 you want *T*-2 *T*-3.
Starting tomorrow, I'm stalking you.
" Or the one in which she and Josh are stranded *-1 in the city *T*-3, and, after *PRO*-2 insisting on separate motel rooms, she knocks on his door *PRO*-2 to pour out her feelings about the rape--*PRO*-2 wearing nothing but a mini-slip and a push - up bra *T*-3.
Surely the question is obvious.
With friends like Mr. Sohmer, do the feminists of Hollywood need enemies?
Broad Inc. said 0 it doubled its regular quarterly dividend to five cents a share from 2.5 cents on common, and to 4.5 cents a share 2.25 cents on Class B stock, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record Nov. 6.
The financial services company emerged from the restructuring of Kaufman & Broad, Inc., which *T*-1 spun off its home - building subsidiary into Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. earlier this year and changed its name to Broad Inc.
For the 10 - month fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Chairman Eli Broad said 0 he expected earnings results to approximate analysts' estimates, which the company said 0 *T*-1 have been revised *-2 upward to 80 cents a share.
This would compare with an estimated loss of 3 cents a share for the comparable 10 months last year, which *T*-1 included restructuring costs.
Centerior Energy Corp. said 0 the Ohio Water Development Authority approved terms for two series of tax - exempt bonds 0 *T*-1 to finance a water - pollution control and solid - waste disposal facilities.
The authority will issue a total of $446.5 million *U* of pollution - control revenue bonds.
Proceeds of the sale will go to Centerior's operating subsidiaries *PRO*-1 to finance the projects, located * at a nuclear unit located * near Cleveland.
The bonds will be issued *-1 for a term of 34 years at an interest rate of 8%.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the underwriter.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Stuart E. Eizenstat, a partner in the Washington law firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this utility holding company, *PRO* increasing board membership to 14.
E.W. Scripps Co. said 0 it has acquired a Georgia cable television company and a Massachusetts publishing firm.
Terms on both deals weren't disclosed *-1.
The media company said 0 it purchased Cable USA Inc., a privately held cable television system in Carroll County, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta.
The system is still under construction and will serve a market of 7,600 homes.
The company also has acquired Sundance Publishers and Distributors Inc., a family owned producer and distributor of educational materials in Littleton, Mass.
Douglas H. Miller, self - employed in the oil and gas securities business, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chairman of this oil and gas exploration company, *PRO* filling a vacancy.
Mr. Miller, who *T*-2 has been a Coda director, also was named *-1 *PRO*-4 chief executive officer, *PRO*-1 succeeding Ted Eubank, who *T*-3 remains president and chief operating officer.
Federal Reserve critics used *-1 to complain of "*PRO* stop and go" monetary policies.
They claimed that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by *PRO*-1 making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt.
But under Alan Greenspan that has changed.
*PRO*-1 A supremely cautious man, the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow.
Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government.
He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, *PRO*-1 dissecting them in dozens of ways, *PRO*-1 probing for hours in search of potential problems.
After *PRO*-4 thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed *-1, and when he finally decides *PRO*-3 to act *T*-2, his movements sometimes seem *-5 excrutiatingly small.
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday - the - 13th stock market plunge.
Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan *PRO*-1 to make an immediate public announcement of his plans *PRO* to provide ample credit to the markets.
But he refused, *PRO*-2 claiming that he wanted *PRO*-3 to see what *T*-1 happened Monday morning before *PRO*-3 making any public statement.
Mr. Greenspan's decision *PRO* to keep quiet also prompted a near - mutiny within the Fed's ranks.
A "senior Fed official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, *PRO*-1 saying 0 the Fed was prepared *PRO*-2 to provide as much credit as the markets needed *?*.
The statement angered Chairman Greenspan, but it was greeted *-1 with applause by the Bush administration and the financial markets.
And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known *-1 to have disagreed with the chairman's decision *PRO* to remain silent.
Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan, who *T*-1 is mistakenly seen as the source.
At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement."
Mr. Brady hesitantly replied that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report."
The Fed chairman's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market's plunge, when the central bank took only modest steps 0 *T*-2 to aid the markets *T*-1.
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added *-1 to the banking system.
And, by the end of that week, the key federal funds interest rate, which *T*-1 is largely controlled *-3 by the Fed, had settled at 8.75%, barely changed * from the level of just under 9% that *T*-2 prevailed the previous week.
Bush administration officials appear *-1 increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault.
Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired * with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in *PRO*-2 reducing rates *T*-1.
Those concerns aren't expressed *-1 in public.
In fact, the administration and the Fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks *PRO*-1 to dispel any impression that they are at odds, *PRO*-1 fearing 0 stories about an administration - Fed split added to the stock market's jitters.
Still, the split is there.
The administration's concerns are understandable.
The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers.
Exports, which *T*-1 played a key role in *PRO* fueling growth over the last two years, seem *-2 to have stalled.
Factory payrolls and production fell in September, and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch.
But Mr. Greenspan remains reluctant *PRO*-2 to loosen policy, partly because he faces a phalanx of presidents of regional Fed banks who *T*-1 oppose credit easing.
In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed * a year or two down the road.
Inflation may be stable at the moment, *PRO*-1 running at about 4.5%.
But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears 0 *?*, prices may begin *-2 to accelerate again next year.
Moreover, if the Fed holds tight, it may be able *PRO*-2 gradually to reduce inflation, *PRO*-3 moving toward the zero - inflation goal that the Fed chairman embraced *T*-1 in testimony to Congress last week.
So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well.
His hand on the monetary tiller seems *-3 one reason why the economy next month seems *-1 highly likely *PRO*-4 to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession *T*-2.
"We've gotten through two stock market crashes, and we've gone through an election without any major problems," says *T*-1 David Hale, an economist of Kemper Financial Services.
"I think 0 you have *-1 to give Greenspan a good rating."
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes.
The Fed's reluctance *PRO* to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession, perhaps starting early next year.
If that happens, Chairman Greenspan could well become an open target.
Already, Congress is toying with legislation 0 *T*-1 to curb the Fed's independence.
If the economy turns down, such proposals could gain strong momentum.
A state trial judge in Illinois gave preliminary approval to a proposed settlement of a suit against a Bank of New York Co. unit, Irving Trust Co., over the interest rates on Irving's former One Wall Street Account money - market deposit accounts.
Judge Albert Green, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, also recognized the suit, filed * last May by Robert and Cynthia Langendorf, as a class action covering thousands of Irving customers.
The plaintiffs accused Irving of *PRO*-2 paying less interest than *PRO* promised *?* in a marketing brochure.
Irving maintained *RNR*-1--and still does *?* *RNR*-1--that its actions were proper under its account agreements with customers.
Under the proposed settlement, customers with valid claims--0 *T*-2 to be submitted *-1 by Dec. 15--will receive "valuable bank services," such as credit cards with reduced finance charges, for two years.
Larry Drury, attorney for the plaintiffs, valued the settlement at between $6 million and $8 million *U*.
A Bank of New York spokesman in Manhattan, Owen Brady, said, "That's the maximum, outside figure.
When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s *T*-1, Akzo NV fell out of bed.
Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which *T*-1 accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left Akzo's survival in doubt.
It wasn't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health *T*-1.
Now, as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms, Akzo says 0 it is in far better shape 0 *PRO* to cope *T*-1.
Investment analysts generally agree.
Aside from *PRO*-1 slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants, Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders ($1.88 billion *U*) on acquisitions since 1983 *PRO*-1 to give it better balance.
During the same period, the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets.
The fibers business, whose products *T*-1 go into textiles, carpeting and myriad industrial uses, now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales.
"We have definitely become less cyclical," Syb Bergsma, executive vice president - finance, said *T*-1 in an interview.
Still, Akzo hasn't yet found a way 0 *PRO* to achieve another goal: a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs *T*-1.
Mr. Bergsma said 0 prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high, *PRO* making it *EXP*-1 unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area.
But he said 0 Akzo is considering "alliances" with American drug companies, although he wouldn't elaborate.
An indication of Akzo's success in *PRO* reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third - quarter results *T*-1.
Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders, up 9% from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier.
A bigger test will come next year if, as many analysts expect, bulk chemical prices slump in Europe.
"Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit," said *T*-1 Jaap Visker, an analyst at Amsterdam - Rotterdam Bank NV.
He figures 0 Akzo is likely *-1 to be one of the few major chemical companies 0 *T*-2 to show profit growth next year.
The bank projects 0 Akzo will show per - share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported * for 1988.
At James Capel & Co. in London, analyst Jackie Ashurst notes that Akzo is less exposed *ICH*-1 than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products.
For example, Akzo has only minor petrochemical operations, is small in plastics and doesn't make fertilizers.
Thus, while Akzo profited less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics, it has less 0 *PRO* to fear *T*-1 from the current slump.
The company is exposed *-1 to bulk chemicals, however.
Although bulk - chemical prices have begun *-2 falling in the U.S., they are generally stable in Europe, Mr. Bergsma said 0 *T*-1.
A decline may come in the first half of 1990, he said 0 *?*, but the market doesn't appear *-1 on the verge of a severe downturn.
*PRO*-1 To reduce the danger of such pricing cycles, Akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals, which *T*-2 have highly specific industrial uses and tend *-3 to produce much higher profit margins than do *?* bulk chemicals.
Akzo's biggest move in this area was the 1987 acquisition of Stauffer Chemical Co.'s specialty chemical business for $625 million *U*.
In a less glamorous field, Akzo is the world's biggest producer of industrial salt, used * as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as *PRO* melting ice.
Akzo also makes products derived * from salt, such as chlorine and caustic soda.
In the fibers division, profit remains weak, largely because of persistent overcapacity.
But Akzo is still slimming down: It recently announced plans *PRO* to eliminate about 1,700 fiber - related jobs in the Netherlands and West Germany.
Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak, Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses, such carbon fibers and aramid, extremely strong fibers used * *PRO* to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet - proof vests.
Akzo's Twaron aramid fiber is a distant second to Du Pont Co.'s Kevlar, which *T*-1 dominates the market.
Mr. Bergsma said 0 world - wide industry sales of aramid fibers are expected *-1 to total about $500 million *U* this year.
Sales growth of 10% a year seems *-1 possible, he said 0 *?*, and Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990.
Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints, auto finishes and industrial coatings.
In August, for example, it completed the $110 million *U* acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc., a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from Tyler Corp.
Mr. Bergsma said 0 Akzo is likely *-1 to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale.
For Akzo's drug business, where profits have shown litle change for the past five years *T*-1, Mr. Bergsma predicted moderate profit growth.
Akzo is the leading seller of birth - control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals *PRO* to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan.
Mr. Bergsma said 0 Akzo hopes *PRO*-1 to have approval *PRO* to sell its Marvelon pill in the U.S. in 1992.
Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests, generic drugs and veterinary products.
Veterinary products are showing especially strong growth, Mr. Bergsma said 0 *T*-1.
Among the leading products is *T*-1 a flu shot for horses.
The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings, one of them bringing tall aliens who *T*-1 glowed in the dark to Voronezh *T*-2.
It *EXP*-1 is the opinion of Timothy Good, author of "Above Top Secret: The World UFO Cover - Up" (Quill / William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95 *U*), that the world laughs too fast.
Here is *T*-2 a bible for UFO watchers, complete with pictures of people who *T*-1 say 0 they've had personal relationships with aliens.
One photo shows a woman sporting a scar 0 she says 0 *T*-2 was made *-1 by a laser beam (a low - caliber weapon, from the looks of the wound).
So far anyway, our alien visitors seem *-1 more intent on *PRO*-2 brightening our skies than *PRO*-2 pulverizing us.
Mr. Good devotes much serious space to the events of Feb. 25, 1942, when American gunners spotted strange lights in the sky above Los Angeles *T*-1.
Air - raid sirens sounded the alarm at 2:25 a.m., *PRO*-1 summoning 12,000 air wardens to duty.
Soon all hell broke loose.
Ground batteries, targeting an odd assortment of aircraft traveling at highly unusual speeds, opened up a furious fusillade.
The sky filled with 12.8 - pound shells, several of which *T*-1 fell back to Earth, *PRO*-2 destroying homes and buildings.
When the smoke cleared *T*-1, six people were dead (three from heart attacks), and everyone wondered what in the world they were shooting at *T*-2.
Mr. Good, who *T*-1 documents these things as best he can *?*, provides an official explanation in the form of a memorandum from Chief of Staff George C. Marshall to President Roosevelt: "1,430 pounds of ammunition," he wrote his commander in chief 0 *?*, were expended *-3 on "unidentified aircraft," flying at speeds as slow as 200 mph and elevations between 9,000 and 18,000 feet.
Well, thousands of Californians on the scene insisted 0 the ammo had been uselessly aimed *-2 at a large, hardy UFO, but you will just have *-1 to make your own decision about such sightings.
One thing *ICH*-1's for sure: There have been a ton of them, and greater beings than the editors of the National Enquirer have shown interest.
Gerald Ford, a fairly down - to - earth fellow, once sent a letter to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee *PRO*-1 recommending that "there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomenon.
I think 0 we owe it *EXP*-1 to the American people *PRO*-2 to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on the subject."
Jimmy Carter went further in a 1976 campaign promise: "If I become president, I'll make every piece of information *ICH*-2 0 this country has *T*-1 about UFO sightings available to the public, and the scientists.
I am convinced *-1 that UFOs exist because I have seen one...."
But you know about campaign promises.
It still doesn't look like governments are coughing up everything 0 they know *T*-1.
Still, despite their efforts *PRO* to convince the world that we are indeed alone, the visitors do seem *-3 to keep *-4 coming and, like the recent sightings, there's often a detail or two that *T*-1 suggests 0 they may actually be a little on the dumb side.
For instance, witnesses in Voronezh say 0 the pinheaded behemoths and their robot friend, after *PRO*-1 strolling around the city park, left behind some rocks.
Now why, you have *-1 to ask yourself *?*, would intelligent beings haul a bunch of rocks around the universe *T*-3?
Or *PRO* land in Russia so often.
In a 1961 incident, a Soviet mail plane disappeared off the radar screen just after *PRO*-1 radioing its position to ground control in Sverdlovsk.
A search party soon found the unscathed aircraft in a forest clearing much too small *PRO* to have allowed a conventional landing.
What *PRO*-1's more, the seven mail personnel aboard were missing.
Again, you have *-1 to ask the obvious question: Why would intelligent beings kidnap seven Soviet mailmen *T*-2?
Speculation as to the nature of aliens will no doubt continue until we wake up one morning *PRO*-1 to find 0 they've taken over "The Today Show," the way 0 they overwhelm an entire town in Jack Finney's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (Fireside / Simon & Schuster, 216 pages, $8.95 *U*) *T*-2.
Maybe some of our talk - show hosts and anchors have already been taken over *-1?
The point of this 1955 novel, which *T*-1 spawned two movies, is that the soulless pod people replicated * by alien plants are virtually indistinguishable from human folks.
Another guy who *T*-1 thinks 0 they're out there and closing fast is Whitley Strieber, whose new novel, "Majestic" (Putnam, 317 pages, $18.95 *U*), *T*-2 takes a look at a reported 1947 UFO crash near the Roswell Army Air Field in a New Mexico desert.
Mr. Strieber knows a lot about aliens.
He even had sex with one--sort of, and not intentionally--as readers learned in his "Communion" (a book recently described * in the New York Times as a "nonfiction best seller").
The way 0 Mr. Strieber tells it *T*-3 in his earnest prose, the intelligence officer who *T*-2 found the craft's strange debris was forced by the government *-1 *PRO*-4 to call the flower - inscribed scraps *PRO*-5 parts of a weather balloon.
The apparent crash became top secret, and the alien creatures went away *PRO*-1 upset with the rude ways of human beings.
We lost our chance *PRO* to communicate with sweet - natured visitors "about four feet tall {who} *T*-2 looked as though they were made *-1 of puffed - up marshmallow."
Mr. Shiflett is an editorial writer for the Rocky Mountain News.
General Electric Co.'s rail - car leasing unit completed the $178.5 million *U* purchase of similar businesses from Leucadia National Corp. and Brae Corp., 74% - owned by Leucadia, the sellers said 0 *T*-1.
The buyer was GE Capital Railcar Services, Chicago, a major owner of railway equipment and part of the GE Capital operations.
Leucadia, New York, estimated 0 it had a pre-tax gain on the transaction of $57 million *U*, including its part of Brae's gain.
Because of tax - loss carry - forward, Leucadia said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to escape taxes on "a substantial portion of the gain."
The estimated gain for Brae is $15 million *U*, including a tax credit of $7 million *U*, the sellers said 0 *T*-1.
"The credit for income taxes is a result of *PRO* having provided deferred income taxes applicable to the sold assets at the higher income tax rates in effect in prior years," the sellers said 0 *T*-1.
Out of the mouths of revolutionaries are coming *T*-1 words of moderation.
Here, at a soccer stadium near the black township of Soweto yesterday, were *T*-2 eight leaders of the African National Congress, seven of whom *T*-1 had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy *PRO* to overthrow the government.
Here were *T*-2 more than 70,000 ANC supporters, gathering for the first ANC rally inside South Africa since the black liberation movement was banned *-1 in 1960.
Here was *T*-1 the state security appartus poised *PRO* to pounce on any words or acts of provocation, let alone revolution.
But the words that *T*-1 boomed over the loudspeakers bore messages of peace, unity, negotiation and discipline.
"We stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow," said *T*-2 Walter Sisulu, the ANC's former secretary general who, along with five of his colleagues, *T*-3 served 26 years in prison before *PRO*-4 being released *-1 two weeks ago.
Some members of the huge crowd shouted "Viva peace, viva."
These are curious times in South African politics.
The government and the ANC, the bitterest of enemies, are engaged *-1 in an elaborate mating dance designed * *PRO*-2 to entice each other to the negotiating table.
Pretoria releases the ANC leaders, most of whom *T*-1 were serving life sentences, and allows them to speak freely, *PRO*-2 hoping that the ANC will abandon its use of violence.
The ANC leaders speak in tones of moderation, *PRO*-1 emphasizing discipline, *PRO*-1 hoping 0 the government will be encouraged *-2 *PRO*-4 to take further steps, such as *PRO* freeing Nelson Mandela, the most prominent ANC figure, and unbanning the organization.
The government of President F.W. de Klerk is using this situation *PRO*-1 to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions.
Meanwhile, the many organizations inside the country that *T*-1 back the ANC are taking the opportunity *PRO* to regain their strength and mobilize their supporters even though the state of emergency, which *T*-2 has severely curtailed black opposition, remains in force.
The result is that the unthinkable and illogical are happening.
Six months ago, government approval for an ANC rally was inconceivable.
Equally inconceivable is *T*-1 that the ANC, given the chance *PRO* to hold a rally, would extend a hand, albeit warily, to the government.
In a message read * out at the rally, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, who *T*-1 can't legally be quoted *-3 in South Africa, said 0 the country was at a crossroads and that Mr. de Klerk "may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our country" if he chooses a "path of genuine political settlement."
Still, this doesn't mean that either the government or the ANC is changing stripes--or that either has moved significantly closer to the other.
The government may ease repression in some areas, but it still keeps a tight grip in others.
For instance, it releases Mr. Sisulu without conditions, yet his son, Zwelakhe, a newspaper editor, is restricted *-1 to his home much of the day and isn't allowed *PRO*-1 to work as a journalist.
The ANC vows *PRO*-1 to keep up pressure on the government.
Speakers yesterday called on foreign governments *PRO*-3 to increase sanctions against Pretoria and urged supporters inside the country *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 defying emergency restrictions and racial segregation, known * as apartheid.
"We cannot wait on the government *PRO*-1 to make changes at its own pace," Mr. Sisulu said *T*-2.
Because the ANC remains banned *-3, both the government, which *T*-1 approved the rally, and the organizers, who *T*-2 orchestrated it, denied 0 it was an ANC rally.
They both called it *PRO*-1 a "*PRO* welcome home" gathering.
Nevertheless, an ANC rally by any other name is still an ANC rally.
The recently released leaders sat high atop a podium in one section of the stadium stands.
Behind them was *T*-2 a huge ANC flag and an even bigger sign that *T*-1 said "ANC Lives, ANC Leads."
Next to them was *T*-2 the red flag of the outlawed South African Communist Party, which *T*-1 has long been an ANC ally.
In the stands, people waved ANC flags, wore ANC T - shirts, sang ANC songs and chanted ANC slogans.
"Today," said *?* Mr. Sisulu, "the ANC has captured the center stage of political life in South Africa."
As a police helicopter circled overhead, Mr. Sisulu repeated the ANC's demands *ICH*-1 on the government *PRO* to create a climate for negotiations: *PRO* Release all political prisoners unconditionally; *PRO* lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations; *PRO* remove all troops from the black townships; *PRO* end the state of emergency, and *PRO* cease all political trials and political executions.
If these conditions are met *-1, he said 0 *?*, the ANC would be prepared *PRO*-3 to discuss *PRO*-4 suspending its guerrilla activities.
"There can be no question of us unilaterally abandoning the armed struggle," he said *T*-1 . "
To date, we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations.
All their utterances are vague."
*PRO*-2 Echoing a phrase from Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Sisulu said, "*PRO* Let all of us who *T*-1 love this country engage in the task of *PRO*-3 building a new South Africa.
Since its founding in 1818, Brooks Brothers, the standard - bearer of the Ivy League look, has eschewed flashy sales promotions and fashion trends--the rules that most retailers live by *T*-1.
But with sales growth sluggish and other men's stores putting on the heat, the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a smug attitude.
So two weeks ago, thousands of Brooks Brothers charge customers--customers conditioned * *PRO*-1 to wait for twice - yearly clearance sales--got a surprise: an invitation *PRO* to come in and buy any one item for 25% off.
During the four - day promotion, shoppers at the Short Hills, N.J., store lined up *PRO*-1 to pay for big - ticket items like coats and suits.
That's not all.
*PRO*-2 Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat, Brooks Brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that *T*-1 carries the slogan, "The Surprise of Brooks Brothers."
One color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied * in a knot; another picture shows neckties with bold designs.
The message is loud and clear: This is not your father's Brooks Brothers.
As part of its national ad pitch, Brooks Brothers will show less preppy women's clothes, *PRO*-1 moving away from its floppy - tie business stereotype.
One ad shows a bright red jacket paired * with a black leather skirt.
And the ad copy is cheeky: "How can you be a Wall Street hot shot *T*-1 without at least one Brooks Brothers suit in your portfolio?"
Brooks Brothers hopes that *PRO* shaking its time - honored traditions will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise.
"We have men who *T*-1 only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who *T*-2 only buy their {job} interview suit here," says *T*-3 William Roberti, chairman *RNR*-4 and chief executive officer *RNR*-4 of Brooks Brothers . "
We want them to buy more of their wardrobe here."
Industry watchers agree that Brooks Brothers is long overdue in *PRO*-2 updating its buttoned - down image, which *T*-1 has stunted its growth.
When *PRO* acquired *-1 in May 1988 by British retailer Marks & Spencer PLC *T*-2, Brooks Brothers' annual operating profit was about $41.8 million *U* on sales of $290.1 million *U*.
Mr. Roberti concedes that since the $750 million *U* takeover, "sales growth hasn't been dramatic."
For the 11 months ended March 31, operating profit at the 52 - store chain totaled $40.5 million *U* on sales of $286.8 million *U*.
As Brooks Brothers jumps into the fashion fray, it will be playing catch up.
Many clothiers, especially Ralph Lauren, have cashed in on the recent popularity of updated Ivy League and English styles.
In keeping with men's broader fashion scope today, businessmen are dabbling in English and Italian suits that *T*-1 are conservative but not stodgy.
The rigid Ivy League customer, Brooks Brothers' bread and butter, meanwhile is becoming extinct.
Thus, Brooks Brothers has lost customers to stores that *T*-1 offer more variety such as Paul Stuart, Barneys New York and Louis, Boston.
"Brooks Brothers no longer has a lock on the {Ivy League} customer who *T*-1 is status - conscious about his clothes," says *T*-2 Charlie Davidson, president of the Andover Shop, a traditional men's store in Cambridge, Mass.
By *PRO*-1 making a break from tradition, Brooks Brothers is seeking a delicate balance.
If it promotes fashion too much, the shop risks *PRO*-1 alienating its old - line customers; by *PRO*-2 emphasizing "value," it risks *PRO*-2 watering down its high - minded mystique.
Fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women's business, given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline.
Brooks Brothers' aim is for 20% of total sales to come from the women's department, up from the current 12%.
"Everybody forgets that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise," observes *T*-1 Carol Farmer, a retail consultant.
"For women, *PRO*-1 dressing for success in a real structured way is over."
Despite these challenges, Marks & Spencer sees big potential in Brooks Brothers, *PRO*-1 noting the widely recognized name and global presence.
Marks & Spencer plans *PRO*-1 to open roughly 18 more U.S. stores in the next five years.
Brooks Brothers says 0 business is robust at its 30 outlets in Japan and two shops in Hong Kong.
Marks & Spencer is also considering *PRO*-1 opening stores across Europe sometime in the future.
Alan Smith, president of Marks & Spencer North America and Far East, says that Brooks Brothers' focus is *PRO* to boost sales by *PRO* broadening its merchandise assortment while *PRO*-1 keeping its "traditional emphasis."
The British parent is also streamlining: Brooks Brothers, which *T*-1 continues *-2 to make almost all of its merchandise, recently shut one of its two shirt plants in Paterson, N.J., and has closed boys' departments in all but 20 stores.
Brooks Brothers is also remodeling its stores.
Wednesday, it will unveil a $7 million *U* refurbishing at its flagship store on Madison Avenue.
With newly installed escalators, the store retains its signature wood - and - brass look but is less intimidating.
More shirts and sweaters will be laid *-1 out on tables, instead of *PRO* sitting behind glass cases, so that customers can "walk up and touch them," Mr. Roberti says 0 *T*-2.
Because the biggest growth in menswear is in casual sportswear, Brooks Brothers is chasing more of that business.
The entire second floor of its Madison Avenue store is now casual sportswear featuring items such as ski sweaters, leather backpacks and a $42 *U* wool baseball hat with the store's crest.
The centerpiece of the overhaul, according to Mr. Roberti, is the men's tailored clothing department, where Brooks Brothers has added new suit styles and fabrics *T*-1.
"The perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit," Mr. Roberti says *T*-2, *PRO*-1 referring to Brooks Brothers' signature three - button "sack suit," with a center - vented jacket and boxy fit.
But it now offers more two - button versions and suits with a tapered fit.
It also plans *PRO*-1 to add suits cut * for athletic men with broader upper bodies.
Next spring, nearly 30% of its suits will have pleated pants, compared with virtually none a couple of years ago.
Says *ICH*-2 Mr. Roberti: "We want *PRO*-1 to turn the customer on.
Karstadt AG said 0 sales for its domestic group rose 4.6% in the first nine months of 1989 from a year earlier.
The West German retailing group also said that the results of the first three quarters suggest 0 it will meet its profit goal for the year.
Earnings at the department - store division, which *T*-1 generates the bulk of profit, should remain at least stable, while income at the mail - order and tourism units is likely *-3 to fall slightly from 1988, the company said 0 *T*-2.
Karstadt didn't give any group sales or profit figures for the first nine months.
A seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was sold *-1 for $416,000 *U*, down $36,000 *U* from the previous sale Oct.
Seats currently are quoted *-1 at $410,000 *U* bid *, $425,000 *U* asked *.
The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $550,000 *U*, *PRO*-1 set March 9, 1989.
Ajinomoto Co., a Tokyo - based food - processing concern, said 0 net income in its first half rose 8.9% to 8.2 billion yen ($57.7 million *U*) from 7.54 billion yen a year earlier.
Sales in the six months ended Sept. 30 were up 4.5% to 229.03 billion yen from 219.27 billion yen.
Sales were higher in all of the company's business categories, with the biggest growth coming in sales of foodstuffs such as margarine, coffee and frozen food, which *T*-1 rose 6.3%.
Oils and fats also did well, *PRO*-1 posting a 5.3% sales increase.
Sales in the category that *T*-1 includes pharmaceuticals, amino acids and chemicals rose 4.7%.
Ajinomoto predicted sales in the current fiscal year ending next March 31 of 480 billion yen, compared with 460.05 billion yen in fiscal 1989.
It said 0 it expects full - year net of 16 billion yen, compared with 15 billion yen in the latest year.
Nissan Motor Co. expects net income to reach 120 billion yen (U.S. $857 million *U*) in its current fiscal year, up from 114.6 billion yen in the previous year, Yutaka Kume, president, said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Kume made the earnings projection for fiscal 1990, ending next March 31, in an interview with U.S. automotive writers attending the Tokyo Motor Show.
The executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because Nissan is spending heavily *PRO*-1 to bolster its dealership network in Japan and because of currency - exchange fluctuations.
During the next decade, Mr. Kume said 0 *?*, Nissan plans *PRO*-2 to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently *PRO* to account for a majority of sales outside Japan.
Last year, Mr. Kume said 0 *?*, Nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles, and produced 570,000 cars and trucks at its factories in North America, Europe and Australia.
But by 1992, he added 0 *?*, Nissan will build one million vehicles a year *ICH*-2 outside Japan, or sufficient *PRO* to equal exports.
"By the end of the 1990s," he said *?*, "we want *PRO*-2 to be producing roughly two vehicles *ICH*-3 overseas for every vehicle that we export *T*-1 from Japan."
That will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity, he acknowledged 0 *T*-1, but didn't provide specific details.
Telxon Corp. said 0 its vice president for manufacturing resigned and its Houston work force has been trimmed *-1 by 40 people, or about 15%.
The maker of hand - held computers and computer systems said 0 the personnel changes were needed *-1 *PRO* to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing operation.
The company said 0 it hasn't named a successor to Ronald Bufton, the vice president who *T*-1 resigned.
Its Houston work force now totals 230.
Federal drug regulators, concerned over British reports that diabetics have died after *PRO*-1 shifting from animal to human - based insulin, say 0 they are considering a study 0 *T*-2 to see if similar deaths have occurred here.
The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London.
In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said 0 the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics 0 he had seen *T*-1 this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985.
At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who *T*-1 had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year, he said 0 *T*-2.
Dr. Solomon Sobel, director of metabolism and endrocrine drug products for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said 0 FDA officials have discussed Dr. Toseland's findings "fairly intensively."
While there have been no reports of similar sudden unexplained deaths among diabetics in the U.S., Dr. Sobel said 0 the FDA plans *PRO*-1 to examine Dr. Toseland's evidence and is considering its own study here.
Dr. Toseland, a toxicologist, said 0 he was preparing an article for a British forensic medical journal *PRO*-2 raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin blunted critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which *T*-1 can kill diabetics.
The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps.
With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by *PRO*-1 eating sugar or sugary food.
"The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia," Dr. Toseland said *T*-1.
At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, Dr. Robert E. Silverman, chief of the diabetes program branch, said 0 no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of 1,500 diabetics that *T*-1 has been under way at NIH for five years.
However, he said 0 officials conducting the study hadn't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness.
"We are now monitoring for it much more closely," he said *T*-1.
"We do know 0 there are slight differences in the way 0 human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar *T*-2," Dr. Sobel said *T*-1.
The human - based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster, he said 0 *T*-1.
"But we don't believe 0 there is enough of a difference *PRO* to be clinically significant," Dr. Sobel said *T*-1.
Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there.
Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines--Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA--recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence 0 *T*-1 to support Dr. Toseland's findings.
On Friday, the American Diabetes Association issued a similar statement urging the six million U.S. diabetics *PRO*-1 not to overreact to the British report.
"A loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that *T*-1 is very unlikely *-3 to be due simply to the type of insulin used *," the American association said *T*-2.
The FDA already requires drug manufacturers *PRO*-2 to include warnings *ICH*-1 with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less pronounced with human insulin than with animal - based products.
Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis - based drug manufacturer, dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known * as Humulin.
Lilly is building plants 0 *PRO* to make the insulin *T*-1 in Indianapolis and Fagershein, France.
In its latest annual report, Lilly said 0 Humulin sales have shown "excellent growth."
Lilly officials said 0 they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin, but didn't know if the problem had caused any deaths.
Dr. Leigh Thompson, a Lilly group vice president, said 0 the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human - based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product.
Dr. Toseland said 0 most of the British diabetics who *T*-1 died had been taking a human - based insulin made * by Novo / Nordisk, a Danish manufacturer.
None of the diabetics were using Lilly's insulin.
THE YALE POLITICAL UNION doesn't pay an honorarium to speakers.
In Thursday's edition, it was incorrectly indicated that the union had paid a fee to former House Speaker Jim Wright.
We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" was "crafted *-1 primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin" with a premise "based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled...."
Perhaps even more offensive is *T*-1 the statement, "It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy."
This legislation was not drafted *-1 by a handful of Democratic "do - gooders."
Quite the contrary--it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped, all appointed * by President Reagan.
You depict the bill as something 0 Democratic leaders "hoodwinked" the administration into *PRO* endorsing *T*-1.
The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, Senate staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials.
Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" as a model for bipartisan deliberations.
Most National Council members are themselves disabled *-1 or are parents of children with disabilities.
We know firsthand the discrimination addressed * by the act: *PRO* to be told *-1 0 there's no place for your child in school; *PRO* to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair; *PRO* to be denied *-2 employment because you are disabled *-3.
Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation *PRO*-1 the "Lawyers' Employment Act."
For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families, this legislation is the "Emancipation Proclamation."

Defense intellectuals have complained for years that the Pentagon cannot determine priorities because it has no strategy.
Last April, the new defense secretary, Richard Cheney, acknowledged that, "given an ideal world, we'd have a nice, neat, orderly process.
We'd do the strategy and then we'd come around and do the budget.
This city doesn't work that way."
With a five - year defense plan costing more than $1.6 trillion *U*, it's about time 0 we put together a defense strategy that *T*-1 works in Washington *T*-2.
This won't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn *PRO*-1 to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures.
As it is *?*, we identify national goals and the threats to these goals, we shape a strategy 0 *PRO* to counter these threats *T*-1, we determine the forces needed * *PRO*-3 to execute the strategy, before finally *PRO*-2 forging the budgets needed * *PRO* to build and maintain the forces.
These procedures consume millions of man - hours of labor and produce tons of paper, and each year, their end product--the Five Year Defense Plan--promptly melts away.
The graph on the left shows how this happens *T*-1 (*PRO* see accompanying illustration--WSJ Oct. 30, 1989).
*PRO* Compare the past eight five - year plans with actual appropriations.
The Pentagon's strategists produce budgets that *T*-2 simply cannot be executed *-1 because they assume 0 a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats.
Strategy, however, is about possibilities, not hopes and dreams.
By *PRO*-1 ignoring costs, U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions.
That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork - barrelers.
These people have different agendas.
And as a result--as the recent vote *ICH*-1 by the House *PRO* to undo Mr. Cheney's program terminations suggests 0 *?*--the preservation of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense "strategy."
How can we turn this situation around *T*-1?
Reform starts in the Pentagon.
Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process.
They ought *PRO*-2 to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program *T*-1.
They would then develop priorities by *PRO*-1 identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets.
They would also identify the best way 0 *PRO* to add programs *T*-1, should the budget come in at higher levels.
This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning.
There is no reason that it cannot be done *-1 for defense planning *T*-2.
Two steps are necessary *PRO* to translate this idea into action.
Step 1 cleans up our books.
Our five - year plan contains three accounting devices--negative money, an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates--which *T*-1 understate the spending 0 the Pentagon has committed itself to *T*-2 by almost $100 billion *U*.
Negative money was invented *-95 in 1988 *PRO* to make the 1990 - 94 Five Year Defense Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan's final budget submission to Congress.
That plan exceeded the numbers contained * in his budget message by $45 billion *U*.
*PRO*-3 To make the books balance, as *PRO* is required *-4 by law, somebody invented a new budget line item that *T*-2 simply subtracted $45 billion *U*.
It is known *-1 in the Pentagon as the "negative wedge."
The Pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $22 billion *U* in the as - yet unidentified procurement reductions that it intends *PRO*-4 to find *T*-3 in future years and $23 billion *U* in an "above guidance" management reserve that *T*-1 accounts for undefined programs that *T*-2 will materialize in the future.
The 1990 plan also assumes 0 inflation will decline to 1.7% by 1994.
Most forecasters, including those in the Congressional Budget Office, assume 0 inflation will be in excess of 4% in each of those five years.
At that rate, the defense plan is underfunded *-1 by $48 billion *U*.
By *PRO*-2 adding the negative wedge and recalculating the remaining program *PRO*-1 using a more probable inflation estimate, we arrive at a baseline program costing $1.7 trillion *U* between 1990 and 1994.
Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline *T*-1 and how these changes would affect our national security *T*-2.
The graph on the right (which *T*-1 assumes a 4% rate of inflation), places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations (*PRO* see accompanying illustration--WSJ Oct. 30, 1989).
*PRO* Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations *T*-1.
Step 2 will answer the question: What *T*-1 happens if these increases do not materialize?
Scenario 1, known * as the "Constant Dollar Freeze," reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only--it slopes upward at 4% per year.
This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985, and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion *U* between 1990 and 1994.
Scenario 3, the "Current Dollar Freeze," has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years.
It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon *PRO*-1 to eat the effects of inflation until 1994.
This reduces the baseline by $229 billion *U*.
Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3, by *PRO*-1 increasing the budget at 2% per year.
It reduces the baseline by $169 billion *U*.
Finally, Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2% per year *ICH*-1 for the next five years--a total reduction of $287 billion *U*.
This can be thought of *-1 as a pessimistic prediction, perhaps driven * by the sequestering effects of the Gramm - Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union.
The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario, *PRO*-1 maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.
They would conclude their efforts by *PRO*-1 producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan--including the assumptions made *, an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations, the impact on national security, and the best strategy for *PRO* working around these limitations.
This exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by *PRO*-1 forcing the strategists *PRO*-2 to make hard decisions.
If, for example, they choose *PRO*-1 to keep the B - 2 Stealth bomber, they would have *-2 to sacrifice more and more other programs--such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions--as they moved toward lower budget levels.
These trade - offs would evolve priorities by *PRO*-2 revealing when the cost of the B - 2 became prohibitive *T*-1.
Some may be tempted *PRO*-1 to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely resurrects the infamous Zero - Based Budgeting (ZBB) concept of the Carter administration.
But ZBB did not involve the strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and therefore degenerated into a bean - counting drill driven * by budget politics.
Anyway, ZBB's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved * was crushed *-1 under a burden of marginalia.
A strategic review is fundamentally different.
It would be run *-1 by the joint chiefs under simple directions: *PRO* Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used *-2 *PRO* to achieve U.S. goals *T*-3.
It might be feared *-1 that *PRO* even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened *-2 to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress.
This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it.
But in the end, it must be rejected *-1 for logical as well as moral reasons.
*PRO* To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because *PRO* acting responsibly will provoke Congress into *PRO*-1 acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest; in other words, that it is justified in *PRO*-2 committing a crime--*PRO*-2 lying to Congress--because it is morally superior.
Strategy is not a game between the Pentagon and Congress; it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us *PRO*-2 to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives *T*-1.
If we want meaningful priorities, we must understand the trade - offs 0 they imply *T*-1 before we make commitments.
Strategy is not a separate event in an idealized sequence of discrete events; it is a way of thinking that *T*-1 neutralizes threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial, cultural and physical limitations.
Mr. Spinney is a permanent Pentagon official.
This is a condensed version of an essay that *T*-1 will appear in the January issue of the Naval Institute Proceedings.

Dentsu Inc., the world's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the Japanese market, is setting its sights on overseas expansion.
Last year, Dentsu started HDM, a joint network with U.S. ad agency Young & Rubicam and Eurocom of France.
A few months ago, Dentsu acquired 69% of Australian agency Fortune Communication Holdings Ltd. for 5.9 million Australian dollars (US$4.6 million *U*).
Dentsu has U.S. subsidiaries, but they keep low profiles.
Now, the giant marketing company, which *T*-1 holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion *U*) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe.
What *T*-1 is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need *PRO* to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe.
"If we don't do something...we won't be able *PRO*-2 to catch up with demand," says *T*-1 a Dentsu spokesman.
"Our president said 0 acquisition is an effective method."
Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.
So far, it appears *-1 cautious about *PRO*-2 taking the big step.
For example, the spokesman says 0 Dentsu has been approached *-1 by banks and securities companies a number of times *PRO*-2 to invest in the troubled British marketing group Saatchi & Saatchi PLC.
But he said 0 Dentsu hasn't looked seriously at Saatchi.
Though Dentsu says 0 it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, it is laying the groundwork for international growth.
It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and *PRO* training workers to do business abroad.
For the year ended March 31, Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion *U* from $7.5 billion *U*, and net income jumped 59% to $102 million *U* from $64 million *U*.
Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second - largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age.
But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers.
On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when *PRO* seeking non-Japanese clients *T*-1.
Thus, an acquisition may prove *-1 the necessary course.
But Japanese agencies are cautious about *PRO*-1 expanding abroad because client relationships are different.
Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry, a practice "that *T*-1 would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules," says 0 *T*-2 Roy Warman, the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi's communications division.
Although *PRO* acquiring a foreign company would expand Japanese advertising agencies' business to foreign clients, many clients would also be Japanese companies expanding overseas, says 0 *T*-1 the Dentsu spokesman.
But the different business system would make it *ICH*-2 hard for Dentsu to provide these Japanese companies the same kind of services 0 they do *T*-1 in Japan.
The NBC network canceled its first new series of the fall TV season, *PRO*-1 killing Mel Brooks's wacky hotel comedy "The Nutt House."
The show, one of five new NBC series, is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall.
Last week CBS Inc. canceled "The People Next Door."
NBC's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2% of homes, *PRO*-1 lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy "Anything But Love" on ABC and CBS's one - hour drama "Jake and the Fatman."
NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., hasn't decided on a permanent replacement for the canceled series.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri B.V. said 0 it signed a contract for the largest - ever power plant order in the Netherlands.
ABB said 0 the contract, signed * with the Dutch utility N.V . Energieproduktiebedrijf UNA, is valued *-1 in excess of $200 million *U*.
The accord is for a turbogenerator plant at the coal - fired power station Hemweg in Amsterdam.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri is the Dutch unit of the Swedish - Swiss electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG.
ABB said 0 a significant portion of the order will be placed *-1 with Dutch subcontractors, *PRO*-2 adding that a group has been set up *-3 for this purpose.
The Dutch utility firm serves the Amsterdam and Utrecht areas.
The planned turbogenerator plant is expected *-1 to go into operation in 1994.
Whittle Communications L.P., which for months *T*-1 has fought a public relations battle with education leaders, said 0 it has signed 500 schools in 24 states to subscribe to the controversial Channel One news program and its sister programs.
Channel One, a satellite - delivered daily program supported * by advertising, is scheduled *-2 to be launched *-1 next March.
Whittle said 0 its field staff signed up the 500 schools in 238 school districts after only eight weeks and company executives now expect *PRO*-1 to reach their start - up goal of 1,000 schools before the end of this year.
Christopher Whittle, chairman of the Knoxville, Tenn., media company that *T*-1 is 50% owned by Time Warner Inc., said that by December 1990 he expects *PRO*-3 to have Channel One installed *-4 in about 8,000 schools with a potential audience of six million.
Installation of the TV system, which *T*-1 includes *PRO*-2 providing free 19 - inch TV sets in classrooms, begins in January.
"What we've done *T*-2 in eight weeks shows 0 we won't have enormous difficulties *PRO* getting to the place 0 we want *PRO*-4 to be *T*-3," said *T*-1 Mr. Whittle.
He said 0 his sales force is signing up schools at the rate of 25 a day.
In California and New York, state officials have opposed Channel One.
Mr. Whittle said 0 private and parochial schools in both states will be canvassed *-1 *PRO* to see if they are interested in *PRO*-2 getting the programs.
Subscribing schools get the 12 - minute daily Channel One news program, whose four 30 - second TV ads during each show *T*-1 have drawn protests from educators.
Subscribers also get the Classroom Channel, which *T*-1 will feature ad - free educational programming similar to some public - TV shows, and the Educator's Channel, which *T*-2 will offer instructional programming for teachers and school administrators and will be supported *-3 by advertising.
Whittle has met some resistance.
The Educational Network, as Mr. Whittle has named the three programs, has been offered *-1 to 1,290 school districts and Whittle continues *-2 to negotiate with 919 districts.
About 10% of the school districts approached * have rejected the network.
Mr. Whittle said that so far, three of the six schools that *T*-1 carried the program in a five - week test last spring have subscribed to the program.
One of the test schools, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, rejected the project.
John Bruner, associate director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools, said 0 Channel One was rejected *-1 because students watching the program didn't fare particularly better *ICH*-3 on a 28 - question current events quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired *-2 *T*-4.
"The number of correct responses was 45% on the test and school absences didn't change much," said *T*-1 Mr. Bruner.
"The pilot program was received *-1 well (by teachers and students), but there wasn't reason enough *PRO* to sign up.
We even invited the public *PRO*-1 to stop by and see the program, but there wasn't much interest."
Advertisers are showing interest.
Last month, Whittle announced 0 it had sold $150 million *U* in advertising time on the network to national advertisers.
Mr. Whittle Friday said 0 several more advertisers have been added *-1.
Whittle is spending $150 million *U* initially *PRO*-1 to launch the network.
Installation of satellite dishes, TVs and videocassette equipment will cost the company about $20,000 *U* per school, Mr. Whittle said 0 *T*-1.
The municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles *PRO*-1 to absorb an oversupply of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers.
Commercial banks and property / casualty insurers, which *T*-1 together own about 36% of all municipal bonds, have been dumping their securities for weeks.
Last week, traders said 0 *?*, there were three institutional sellers for every buyer.
"Every day we're getting new bid lists" from *PRO* would - be sellers, one trader said 0 *T*-1.
"Most dealers cannot continue *-1 to absorb this supply."
As a result, yields on long - term muni bonds now stand at about 95% of long - term Treasury yields, the highest such level in more than two years.
"There is incredible negative psychology building in the market," said *T*-1 Donna Avedisian, a vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co.
"People are very concerned about who *T*-1 is going *-2 to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers."
The yield on a group of 25 revenue bonds compiled * by the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, now exceeds 7.50%.
At this week's New York City bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20 - year New York bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds.
For an investor in the 28% federal tax bracket, 7.9% tax - free is the same as 10.38% on a taxable investment.
That's a taxable - equivalent yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds.
How quickly things change *T*-1.
This past summer, investors' appetite for municipal bonds seemed *-1 insatiable.
Individuals eager for tax - free income drove up bond prices, *PRO*-1 making state and local government debt one of the best - performing types of fixed - income investments during the period.
But while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value, you wouldn't know it by the way 0 institutional investors are rushing *PRO*-1 to dump their holdings *T*-2.
Bond market analysts say 0 the institutional selling was triggered *-1 by several factors.
Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan, which *T*-1 have been taking heavy charges *PRO*-2 to expand their Third World loan - loss reserves, aren't looking for tax - exempt income.
"We don't need the shelter of tax - free bonds," said *T*-1 a spokeswoman at Chemical.
In recent weeks, traders said 0 *?*, Chemical has sold more than $1 billion *U* of tax - free bonds.
The spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its muni holdings, but couldn't immediately confirm the amount.
Insurance companies are rushing *PRO*-1 to sell before the end of the year, when some of their tax benefits associated * with municipal bonds will be phased out *-2 *T*-3.
There is speculation that property / casualty firms will sell even more munis as they scramble *PRO*-1 to raise cash 0 *PRO* to pay claims related * to Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake *T*-2.
Fundamental factors are at work as well.
Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs *T*-1.
The recent natural disasters, and the need *ICH*-2 of many other cities *PRO* to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, suggests that supply of new issues will continue *-1 to rise sharply--even as demand tapers off.
"There is just so much *ICH*-4 going on that it *EXP*-2's difficult *PRO* to pick just one factor that *T*-1's driving the market," said *T*-3 Ronald Ian Heller, vice president at First Chicago Capital Markets Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago Corp.
Some of the recent selling could actually be considered *-1 a positive sign.
Mutual funds, for example, are said *-1 to be selling existing municipal bonds *PRO*-2 to raise cash 0 *PRO* to buy new issues *T*-3.
Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen *T*-1, some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought * now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds.
Ms. Avedisian believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that *T*-1 have a negative convexity--those that *T*-2 have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates.
Such bonds, she says 0 *?*, are those that *T*-1 are nearing their call date.
But traders said 0 the market's tone could pick up this week if New York City's $787 million *U* bond offering goes well.
The offering will include $729 million *U* of 20 - year tax - exempt bonds and $57.8 million *U* of taxable bonds.
A few weeks ago, New York sold $750 million *U* of tax - exempts.
New York City bonds have been beaten *-1 down for three straight weeks.
On Friday, some issues fell nearly one point, or close to $10 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The sell - off in New York City bonds was triggered *-1 by concerns about the city's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election.
The city's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling.
"The city has issued so much supply *ICH*-1 recently that some people are getting a little concerned.
They'd like *PRO*-1 to see some other names in their portfolios," said *T*-2 Michael S. Appelbaum, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
But he thinks 0 investors may be overreacting to the market's problems.
Overall, he says 0 *?*, municipal prices are "very cheap" and represent an "excellent buying opportunity."
Friday's Market Activity
Treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week's Treasury debt auction and rumors that a major Japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long - term bonds.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond ended at a price of 102 2/32, down nearly 5/8 point *ICH*-1 from Thursday, or about $6.25 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The issue's yield rose to 7.93% from 7.88%.
Late Thursday, the Treasury said 0 it needed *-1 to raise $17 billion *U* quickly and would do so by *PRO*-1 issuing new securities this week.
Credit market analysts expected the Treasury to cancel today's three - month and six - month sale and to sell $17 billion *U* of cash management bills.
Instead, the Treasury announced 0 it would sell $2 billion *U* of 51 - day cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $15.6 billion *U* of three - month and six - month bills will take place today, as usual, but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of Thursday.
By *PRO*-3 moving the settlement date ahead, the Treasury can raise money under the $2.87 trillion *U* debt ceiling that *T*-1 is in effect through tomorrow, after which it reverts to $2.8 trillion *U* *T*-2.
The market also was hurt *-1 by rumors that Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru, a Japanese brokerage firm, was unloading some of the 30 - year bonds 0 it recently purchased *T*-2.
One dealer said 0 the talk was that the firm sold about $500 million *U* of bellwether 30 - year bonds.
The firm is thought *-3 to have purchased up to $3 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds in a buying spree on Wednesday and the previous Thursday.
Dealers say 0 the firm apparently has wanted *PRO*-4 to publicize its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30 - year bonds by *PRO*-2 using Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Corp. as a broker.
Cantor provides price quotes to Telerate Systems Inc., a widely used electronic system.
Nippon Kangyo's moves puzzled traders and created confusion among potential investors, many of whom *T*-5 decided *PRO*-6 to stay out of the market.
As a result of its large - scale buying, some analysts now say that liquidity, or the ability *PRO* to easily buy and sell, has been constrained *-1 in the benchmark Treasury bond issue.
In other markets:
-- The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rallied Friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to Nestle Foods Corp. for $370 million *U*.
The sale price, which *T*-1 was above Wall Street expectations, sent many RJR securities up by one point.
"It shows that there are buyers of high - quality assets at high prices in today's market," said *T*-7 Robert Long, managing director and head of the high - yield research department at First Boston Corp.
Many of the RJR securities, which *T*-1 had been trading near their 52 - week lows earlier in the session, bounced back after the company's announcement that it agreed *PRO*-8 to sell its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle Foods, a unit of the Swiss - based food concern.
The sale, expected *PRO* to close before the end of the year, also includes a manufacturing plant in Franklin Park, Ill.
RJR's subordinated discount debentures of 2001, which *T*-1 traded as low as 45 Friday, finished the day at 46 7/8.
Other RJR securities also closed higher.
RJR Holdings Capital Corp.'s 14.7% convertible *PRO* pay - in - kind securities maturing in 2009 closed 1/2 higher at 86 1/2 after *PRO*-9 trading as low as 85 1/4.
Most other junk bond issues finished a quarter - point lower on rumors that Campeau Corp. was filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
A spokesman for Campeau called the rumors "*PRO*-1 ridiculous."
Most investment - grade bonds fell 3/8 to 1/2 point.
-- Mortgage securities fell 7/32 to 8/32 but held up better than intermediate Treasurys.
Dealers said 0 some defensive investors were buyers of mortgages, as were *?* dealers seeking collateral for REMICs priced * earlier last week.
Among major issues, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery ended at 98 12/32, down 8/32 point for a yield of about 9.35% to a 12 - year average life assumption.
Wilfred American Educational Corp. said 0 a federal grand jury in Boston indicted the operator of cosmetology and business schools for mail fraud.
The charges in the 12 - count indictment, which *T*-1 stem from events that *T*-2 allegedly occurred in late 1984 and early 1985, involve enrollment procedures of six students and the preparation of certain reports, Wilfred said 0 *T*-3.
No individuals were charged *-1 in the indictment.
Wilfred American said 0 it will "vigorously defend" itself against the charges and added that the charges relate to procedures that it has since changed *T*-1.
Eight admissions representatives at two of Wilfred's former Massachusetts schools previously pleaded guilty to charges of *PRO* aiding, abetting and counseling students to submit false financial - aid applications.
Wilfred closed its Massachusetts schools earlier this year.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Wilfred fell 6.25 cents to 93.75 cents a share.
A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously.
Researchers at Ohio State University and Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology in China have analyzed samples of glacial ice in Tibet and say 0 temperatures there have been significantly higher *ICH*-1 on average over the past half - century than in any similar period in the past 10,000 years.
The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.
A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, *PRO*-1 raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas.
"If you can use data *PRO* to reconstruct what *T*-2 happened in the past, you have much more confidence in predictions for the future," said *T*-5 Lonnie Thompson, a research scientist at Ohio State who *T*-3 dug for *RNR*-1 and analyzed *RNR*-1 the ice samples.
*PRO*-1 To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen.
These measurements can indicate temperature changes, researchers said 0 *?*, because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change.
Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher *ICH*-1 in 1937-87 than in any other 50 - year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said 0 *T*-2.
Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first 0 *T*-2 to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which *T*-1 moderate temperature changes.
But the ice - core samples aren't definitive proof that the so - called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating, Mr. Thompson acknowledged 0 *T*-1.
According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused * by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from *PRO*-1 escaping into space.
Skeptics say that if that's the case, temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over the past century, *PRO* reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide.
Instead, the Dunde ice - core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s, decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, then higher temperatures again through last year.
Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings.
"Climate varies drastically due to natural causes," said *T*-1 Mr. Thompson.
But he said 0 ice samples from Peru, Greenland and Antarctica all show substantial signs of warming.
Milton Petrie, chairman of Petrie Stores Corp., said 0 he has agreed *PRO*-1 to sell his 15.2% stake in Deb Shops Corp. to Petrie Stores.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Petrie said that on Oct. 26 Petrie Stores agreed *PRO*-1 to purchase Mr. Petrie's 2,331,100 Deb Shops shares.
The transaction will take place tomorrow.
The filing said 0 Petrie Stores of Secaucus, N.J., is purchasing Mr. Petrie's Deb Shops stake as an investment.
Although Petrie Stores has considered *PRO* seeking *PRO*-1 to acquire the remaining equity of Deb Stores, it has no current intention *PRO* to pursue such a possibility, the filing said 0 *T*-3.
Philadelphia - based Deb Shops said 0 it saw little significance in Mr. Petrie selling his stock to Petrie Stores.
"We didn't look at it and say, ` Oh my God, something is going *-1 to happen,"' said 0 *T*-2 Stanley Uhr, vice president and corporate counsel.
Mr. Uhr said that Mr. Petrie or his company have been accumulating Deb Shops stock for several years, *PRO*-1 each time issuing a similar regulatory statement.
He said 0 no discussions currently are taking place between the two companies.
THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD'S coming rule on disclosure involving financial instruments will be effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after June 15, 1990.
The date was misstated *-1 in Friday's edition.
Finnair, Finland's state - owned airline, joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a wide - ranging cooperation agreement with archrival Scandinavian Airlines System.
Under the accord, Finnair agreed *PRO*-1 to coordinate flights, marketing and other functions with SAS, the 50% - state - owned airline of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
The pact also calls for coordination between Finnair and Switzerland's national carrier, Swissair, with which SAS entered a similar alliance last month *T*-1.
Finnair and SAS said 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to swap stakes in each other.
Neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month.
Officials hinted, however, that SAS would take a stake of at least 6% in Finnair, valued * at about $40 million *U* at current market prices.
Finnair would receive SAS shares valued * at the same amount, officials said 0 *T*-1.
Employees of the Globe and Mail, a Thomson Corp. newspaper in Toronto, voted *PRO*-1 to accept a tentative contract agreement Saturday, *PRO*-1 averting a strike at Canada's leading daily.
Under the terms of the three - year contract, similar to one reached * at Torstar Corp.'s Toronto Star newspaper earlier this month, the 500 Globe and Mail workers will see a raise of 8% in the contract's first year and 7% in each of the following two years.
Lorne Slotnick, vice chairman of the Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild, the union representing the workers, said 0 Thomson made significant concessions in the final round of talks.
In addition to wage increases, the union negotiated improved vacation plans, benefit packages and pension plans, Mr. Slotnick said 0 *T*-1.
He said 0 more than 70% of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that *T*-1 stand as milestones of American business history.)
Thomas Jefferson sold Congress on the idea of the decimal system for currency, thus *PRO*-1 saving Americans the headaches of pounds, shillings and pence.
But he struck out with the decimal system of metric weights and measures 0 the French had invented *T*-1.
Instead, Congress opted for the inches, feet and yards 0 the colonists had brought *T*-1 with them.
Americans didn't dislike metrics; they simply ignored them.
Scientists felt differently.
In 1807, the Swiss mathematician who *T*-1 headed the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made an "iron meter" that he had brought *T*-2 from Europe the standard of measure.
By the end of the century scientists had embraced the system.
Businessmen took their cue from the engineers.
When Congress finally passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975 *T*-1, industry was far ahead.
Because the law made compliance voluntary, it inspired little more than jokes.
(The press had a field day with questions about what *T*-1 would happen to "six - footer," "yardstick" and "inchworm.")
Today, though the public is barely aware, much of U.S. industry, particularly companies manufacturing or selling overseas, have made metrics routine.
General Motors, for example, uses metric terms for its automobile bodies and power trains.
(In auto advertising, however, items such as wheelbases are still described *-1 in inches.)
Farm - machine makers such as Caterpillar and Deere work in the metric system.
The liquor industry went metric 10 years ago.
The Pentagon has led the charge, particularly as military alliances spread world - wide.
New weapons systems will be around until the next century, notes 0 *T*-1 John Tascher, the Defense Department's metric coordinator.
Still, like the auto makers, when *PRO*-1 dealing with Mr. Everyman *T*-2 the Pentagon sticks to the tried and true.
Soldiers and sailors are still measured *-1 in inches and pounds.
SharesBase Corp. said 0 it will reduce its 221 - person work force by about 25%, effective tomorrow, in an effort *PRO* to stem continuing losses.
The company, which *T*-1 makes data base systems and software, said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to report a loss for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.
Mobil Corp. is in the midst of *PRO* cutting back its exploration and production group, which *T*-1 finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the U.S., by as much as 15% as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business.
Management advised employees Friday that it was going *-1 to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8%, or 400 people.
The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees *T*-1, a company spokesman said 0 *T*-2 in response to questions.
Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc., the group involved *, currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000.
A few years ago, Mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide shakeout.
But since then U.S. oil production has declined and Mobil wants *PRO*-1 to focus its oil - finding efforts overseas.
Mobil alluded to the work - force cuts last week when it took a $40 million *U* charge as part of its third - quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring *T*-1.
Mobil officials said that it is unlikely 0 any additional charges related * to this move will be taken *-1 in future quarters.
On Wednesday, Mobil will begin *-1 offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation.
Mobil officials said 0 they have been studying ways of *PRO* streamlining these operations since early this year.
During the coming months, layers of management will be peeled *-1 away and regional offices will become more autonomous.
For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized *-1 into teams responsible for *PRO* managing the properties under their jurisdiction, Mobil said 0 *T*-2.
"The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations," said *T*-1 Charles E. Spruell, president of the Mobil unit.
Field offices at New Orleans; Houston; Denver; Midland, Tex.; Bakersfield, Calif.; Oklahoma City; and Liberal, Kan., will be maintained *-1.
But the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed *-1 while at others the work force will be increased *-2.
For instance, employment in Denver will be reduced *-1 to 105 from 430.
But on the West Coast, where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region *T*-1, the Bakersfield, Calif., office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305.
The reorganization will "focus on the value and potential of assets," Mr. Spruell said 0 *T*-1.
Presidio Oil Co. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement *PRO* to acquire Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.'s U.S. unit for $163 million *U*.
Presidio, a Denver oil and gas concern, said 0 it will acquire the properties and operations of Home Petroleum Corp., which *T*-1 includes two regional gas - gathering systems and proved reserves of about nine million barrels of oil and 72 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
Presidio said 0 the properties are generally situated *-1 in Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
Gulf Canada, Calgary, said 0 the transaction is part of its plan *PRO* to sell non-strategic assets and focus operations on Canada, Indonesia and other international areas.
A spokesman for Gulf Canada, which *T*-2 is controlled *-1 by Toronto's Reichmann family, said 0 the properties account for about 6% of the company's assets and produce about 5,000 barrels of oil and 35 million cubic feet of gas a day.
He said 0 Gulf Canada will likely report an extraordinary gain from the sale in the fourth quarter, but he wouldn't offer a specific estimate.
The transaction is expected *-1 to close by Nov. 30.
The premium 0 the elderly pay *T*-1 for coverage of doctor's bills under Part B of the Medicare health insurance plan will rise to $29 *U* a month in 1990 from $27.90 *U*, the Department of Health and Human Services said 0 *T*-2.
In addition, a second Part B premium 0 *T*-1 to cover the cost of the new program of insurance against catastrophic illness will rise to $4.90 *U* a month from $4 *U*, if Congress doesn't change the program.
The House has voted *PRO*-2 to repeal most of the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, however, which *T*-1 would end the monthly catastrophic - care premium, as well as an unpopular income surtax paid * by about 40% of the wealthier Medicare beneficiaries.
Under a less - sweeping Senate plan, the catastrophic - care monthly premium would continue, *PRO*-2 rising to $4.90 *U* next year, but the surtax would be abolished *-1.
Medicare Part B pays 80% of a beneficiary's allowable doctor's bills after an annual deductible of $75 *U*.
The Catastrophic Coverage Act would add a *PRO* stop - loss provision *ICH*-2 next year 0 *PRO*-1 to limit the maximum 0 beneficiaries must pay *T*-3 for doctors.
Both the House and Senate bills 0 *T*-1 to reduce the cost and coverage of the catastrophic - care plan would eliminate the cap on doctor's bills.
If the House prevails in its efforts *PRO* to kill the catastrophic - care plan, the monthly Part B premium will be $29 *U* next year.
If the Senate plan prevails, the premium will be $33.90 *U*, with the additional $4.90 *U* going *-1 to pay for expanded hospital coverage under Part A of Medicare.
Most of Part A's costs are paid *-1 by a payroll tax on workers and employers.
Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics producer, said 0 it had net income of 5.64 billion yen ($39.7 million *U*) in its first half, which *T*-1 ended Sept. 30.
Exact comparisons with the previous year were unavailable because of a change in the company's fiscal calendar.
The Tokyo - based company had net of 3.73 billion yen in the previous reporting period, which *T*-1 was the four months ended March 31.
Sales in the first half came to 159.92 billion yen, compared with 104.79 billion yen in the four - month period.
Shiseido predicted that sales for the year ending next March 31 will be 318 billion yen, compared with 340.83 billion yen in the year ended Nov. 30, 1988.
It said 0 it expects net to rise to 11 billion yen from 8.22 billion yen.
Factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall, machine tool makers say 0 *?*, but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth - quarter demand from the important automotive industry.
September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums, but remained 7.7% below year - earlier levels, according to figures from NMTBA--the Association for Manufacturing Technology.
Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million *U* of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million *U*, but still below the $328.2 million *U* of September 1988, NMTBA said 0 *T*-1.
Machine tools are complex machines ranging from lathes to metal - forming presses that *T*-1 are used *-2 *PRO* to shape most metal parts.
"Overall demand still is very respectable," says *T*-1 Christopher C. Cole, group vice president at Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine tool producer.
"The outlook *ICH*-1 is positive for the intermediate to long term."
September orders for all U.S. producers, in fact, were slightly above the monthly average for 1988, a good year for the industry.
"Aerospace orders are very good," Mr. Cole says *T*-1.
"And export business is still good.
While some automotive programs have been delayed *-1, they haven't been canceled *-2."
"September was one of the biggest order months in our history," says *T*-1 James R. Roberts, vice president, world - wide sales and marketing, for Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis.
At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives, "everybody 0 I talked with *T*-1 was very positive," he says 0 *T*-2.
Most say 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to spend more *ICH*-2 on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989.
But sales of North American - made 1990 - model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier.
And truck sales also are off more than 20%.
Auto makers, who *T*-1 began *-2 deferring some equipment purchases last spring, can be expected *-3 to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up, machine tool builders say 0 *T*-4.
Machine tool executives are hopeful, however, that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S. - made machine tools in that region.
There is demand for state - of - the - art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive *PRO*-1 to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods.
However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might.
"The Commerce Department says *PRO* go, and the Defense Department says *PRO* stop," complains *T*-1 one machine tool producer.
If that controversy continues, U.S. machine tool makers say 0 *?*, West German and other foreign producers are likely *-1 to grab most of the sales in Eastern Europe.
September orders for machining centers, lathes, milling machines, grinders, boring mills and other machines that *T*-1 shape metal by cutting totaled $192.9 million *U*, down 28% from $266.5 million *U* a year earlier, but a 23% increase from August's $156.3 million *U*, NMTBA said 0 *T*-2.
Orders *ICH*-1 last month for metal - forming presses and other machinery 0 *PRO* to form metal with pressure *T*-2 surged to $110.1 million *U*, a 78% rise from $61.7 million *U* a year earlier and a 55% gain from $70.9 million *U* in August.
Today's presses are large and costly machines, and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that *T*-1 doesn't necessarily indicate a trend.
Machine tool shipments last month were $281.2 million *U*, a 24% rise from a year earlier and a 25% increase from August.
Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year, as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs.
U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion *U* backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September.
That was up 2.8% from a year earlier, even though orders for the first nine months of 1989 were down 19% from the comparable 1988 period.
$2,057,750,000 *U*.
$675,400,000 *U*.
$1,048,500,000 *U*.
$588,350,000 *U*.
PARKER HANNIFIN Corp., which *T*-1 is selling three automotive replacement parts divisions, said 0 it will retain its Automotive Connectors and Cliff Impact divisions.
The divisions that Parker Hannifin is retaining *T*-1 weren't mentioned *-2 in Thursday's edition.
Retailers in the West and parts of the South are entering the critical Christmas shopping season with more momentum than those in other regions.
In a new report, the International Council of Shopping Centers said 0 sales of general merchandise in the West for the first seven months of 1989 rose 6.6% above year - earlier levels.
Sales increased a more modest 4.8% in the South and 4.4% in the Midwest.
But sales in the oil - patch state of Texas surged 12.9% and sales in South Carolina jumped 10.6% in the period, the New York trade group said 0 *T*-1.
In the Northeast, however, sales declined 0.4% in the period, with sales in New England falling 2.6%.
The numbers show that "we don't have a monolithic economy," said *T*-1 Isaac Lagnado, council research director.
"There are a lot of *PRO* have and have - not markets."
Sales nationally rose 3.9% through July, the latest month for which the figures are available *T*-2, the council said 0 *T*-1.
The Northern California earthquake and Hurricane Hugo are likely *-1 to temporarily damp sales growth in the West and South Carolina.
But Mr. Lagnado predicted 0 the regional trends would continue through Christmas.
"The big mo is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics," he said *T*-1.
The Christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits.
The council's report is based *-1 on data 0 the trade group buys *T*-2 from the U.S. Census Bureau.
The information on 125 metropolitan markets is supplied *-1 by retailers such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and K mart Corp. as well as closely held concerns such as R.H. Macy & Co.
The council plans *PRO*-1 to release its regional reports monthly.
Mr. Lagnado said strength in employment appears *-1 to have the biggest impact on sales growth.
El Paso, Austin and Fort Worth, the three strongest retail markets in the nation, are all located *-1 in Texas, where employment grew a relatively strong 2% *T*-2.
Massachusetts, which *T*-1 has lost jobs in the computer and defense - related industries, was the weakest link in bleak New England.
The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years.
In 1987, the West had the slowest sales growth, and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively, according to the council.
Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably won't ever recover sales lost * because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo, they could see some benefits later on.
Stores such as Sears that *T*-1 sell big - ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush *PRO*-3 to replace items lost * in the disasters, he said 0 *T*-2.
In what *T*-1 could prove *-2 a major addition to the Philippines' foreign - investment portfolio, a Taiwanese company signed a $180 million *U* construction contract *PRO* to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex.
Taiwan's USI Far East Corp., a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement *ICH*-3 with an unidentified Japanese contractor *PRO* to build a naphtha cracker, according to Alson Lee, who *T*-1 heads the Philippine company set up *-2 *PRO*-4 to build and operate the complex.
Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said 0 the contract was signed *-1 Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials.
Contract details, however, haven't been made *-1 public.
The complex is *-2 to be located *-1 in Batangas, about 70 miles south of Manila.
USI Far East will hold a 60% stake in Luzon Petrochemical, according to papers signed * with the Philippine government's Board of Investments.
The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha *PRO*-1 to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene.
These are the raw materials used * in *PRO* making plastics.
The contract signing represented a major step in the long - planned petrochemical project.
At an estimated $360 million *U*, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986.
It also is considered *-1 critical to the country's efforts *PRO* to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities.
The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade.
However, workers can't break ground until legal maneuvers *PRO* to block the complex *ICH*-1 are resolved *-2, moves which *T*-3 caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment.
As *PRO* previously reported *-1, a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued *PRO*-2 to stop the plant.
The legislator, Enrique Garcia, had actively backed the plant *NOT*, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of Manila.
The country's Supreme Court dismissed the suit, but Mr. Garcia late last month filed for a reconsideration.
In addition, President Aquino has yet *-2 to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material 0 *T*-3 to be used *-1 in the cracker.
However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Aquino backed the project and said 0 her government was attempting *PRO*-1 to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in Bataan province.
"We have tried our best *PRO*-3 to tell the people in Bataan that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best *PRO*-2 to encourage other investors *PRO*-4 to go to their province," Mrs. Aquino told Manila - based foreign correspondents *T*-1.
The project appeared *-1 to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project, China General Plastics Corp., backed out *T*-2.
China General Plastics, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was *-1 to have a 40% stake in Luzon Petrochemical.
However, Mr. Lee said that USI Far East is confident 0 other investors will take up the slack.
He said 0 USI Far East has applied to both the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank's International Finance Corp. for financing that *T*-1 could include equity stakes.
MEDICINE SHOPPE INTERNATIONAL Inc. declared a 3 - for - 2 stock split, and substantially boosted the dividend payout.
The franchiser of pharmacies said 0 the added shares will be distributed *-1 Dec. 4 to stock of record Nov. 13.
The company also changed its dividend policy, under which holders had received an annual 10 cents - a - share payment *T*-2, by *PRO*-4 declaring a four - cents - a - share dividend, 0 *T*-3 to be paid *-1 quarterly on post-split shares.
Following is *T*-1 a weekly listing of unadited net asset values of publicly traded investment fund shares, reported * by the companies as of Friday's close.
Also shown *-1 is *T*-2 the closing listed market price or a dealer - to - dealer asked price of each fund's shares, with the percentage of difference.

Merger and acquisition activity in the third quarter exceeded the year - earlier pace, said 0 *T*-1 Merrill Lynch & Co.'s W.T. Grimm & Co. unit in Schaumburg, Ill.
A total of 672 transactions were announced *-1 during the latest quarter, up 13% from the year - earlier period's 597, Grimm said 0 *T*-3.
Transactions in which prices were disclosed *-1 *T*-2 totaled $71.9 billion *U*, up 36% from $52.9 billion *U* a year earlier, the company added 0 *T*-3.
Grimm counted 16 transactions valued * at $1 billion *U* or more *ICH*-1 in the latest period, twice as many as a year earlier.
The largest was the $12 billion *U* merger creating Bristol - Myers Squibb Co.
In the first nine months, 1,977 transactions were announced *-1, up 15% from 1,716 in the year - earlier period.
Transactions in which prices were disclosed *-1 *T*-2 totaled $188.1 billion *U*, up 15% from $163.2 billion *U* a year earlier.
*PRO*-1 Citing current stock market conditions and the trend away from highly leveraged transactions, Grimm said 0 it wasn't certain that the total value of transactions for the year will exceed the record $247 billion *U* in 1988.
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed *-1 to do *T*-2: *PRO* revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of *PRO* renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, *PRO*-1 saying only that "if there's an all - out military offensive, that's going *-2 to change the equation 180 degrees."
But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend *PRO* to end a 19 - month cease - fire with the rebels seeking *PRO* to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said yesterday on NBC - TV's "*PRO* Meet the Press" that Mr. Ortega's threat *ICH*-3 was "a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."
The threat came during a two - day celebration in Costa Rica 0 *T*-1 to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region, attended * by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders.
Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.
Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease - fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army.
Saturday, he amended his remarks *PRO*-1 to say that he would continue *-2 to abide by the cease - fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.
He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted *-1 to *PRO* disarming and demobilizing the rebels.
Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what *T*-2 was intended *-1 as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua *PRO*-1 to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.
And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are *-1 to receive the rest of the $49 million *U* in so - called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached * with the Bush administration in March.
The humanitarian assistance, which *T*-1 pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed * along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut * off by Congress in February 1988.
While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut *-2 off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued *-1.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan .) said yesterday on "*PRO* Meet the Press": "I would hope 0 after his {Mr. Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid."
Sen. Dole also said 0 he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to offer *T*-2 tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader.
While *PRO* renewing military aid had been considered *T*-1 out of the question, *PRO*-1 rejected *-2 by Congress and de-emphasized *-2 by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity *PRO* to press the administration on the issue.
"The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided *-1 by the Sandinistas...they should call for military aid," said *T*-2 former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.
"In these circumstances, I think 0 they'd win."
Sen. Mitchell said that congressional Democrats intend *PRO*-1 to honor the March agreement *PRO* to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action.
Mr. Ortega's threat *PRO* to breach the cease - fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.
Secretary of State James Baker, who *T*-1 accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: "I have no reason 0 *PRO* to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers *T*-2."
Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson, while *PRO*-1 maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease - fire, acknowledged: "It *EXP*-2's never very clear who *T*-3 starts what."
He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined *-1 that those units broke the cease - fire *T*-2.
In addition to *PRO* undermining arguments in favor of *PRO* ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways 0 *PRO* to manipulate or void the February elections *T*-1.
Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways 0 *PRO* to strengthen his hand prior to the elections *T*-1.
Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking *PRO*-1 to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections *PRO*-2 to remove any pressure *PRO* to hold fair elections.
"My sense is 0 what they have *T*-2 in mind is an excuse for *PRO* clamping down on campaigning" by *PRO*-3 creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said 0 *T*-1.
Texas Instruments Inc., *PRO*-1 once a pioneer in portable computer technology, today will make a bid *PRO* to reassert itself in that business by *PRO*-2 unveiling three small personal computers.
The announcements are scheduled *-3 to be made *-1 in Temple, Texas, and include a so - called "notebook" PC that *T*-2 weighs less than seven pounds, has a built - in hard disk drive and is powered *-4 by Intel Corp.'s 286 microprocessor.
That introduction comes only two weeks after Compaq Computer Corp., *PRO*-1 believing 0 it had a lead of three to six months on competitors, introduced the first U.S. notebook computer with such features.
Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq, however, Texas Instruments' new notebook won't be a direct competitor.
While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value - added resellers and original - equipment manufacturers.
The introductions also mark Texas Instruments' plunge back into a technology 0 it has all but ignored *T*-1 for the past several years.
Although the Dallas - based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal *ICH*-1 in 1971--a 38 - pound monster--and the world's first microprocessor - based portable in 1976, the only portable machines 0 it has introduced *T*-4 since the first part of the decade have been "dumb" terminals with limited on - board processing ability.
It stopped *-1 selling a standard personal computer a while ago.
Now that is about *-1 to change, as Texas Instruments begins *-2 marketing two 14 - pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives.
The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened * by GRiD Systems Corp., now a unit of Tandy Corp., almost two years ago.
But the notebook, with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk, is more innovative.
*PRO*-2 Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery, the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches, has a 20 - megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that *T*-1 is 22% larger than Compaq's.
Its keyboard, according to industry consultants, is better than Compaq's, but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter.
It doesn't have an internal floppy disk drive, although a snap - on drive can be purchased *-1 separately.
Its greatest drawback may be its 3 - inch thickness, big enough for one consultant to describe it as "clunky."
List prices on the heavier Texas Instrument laptops will be $4,999 *U* for the TI Model 25, with a 20 megabyte disk drive, and $5,599 *U* for the 40 - megabyte Model 45.
The notebook, the TI Model 12, will be priced *-1 at $4,199 *U*.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said 0 it applied to Taiwanese securities officials for permission *PRO* to open brokerage offices in Taipei.
Shearson's application is the first since the Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission announced June 21 that it would allow foreign brokerage firms to do business in that country.
Taiwan officials are expected *-1 to review the Shearson application later this year.
Under current rules, investors in Taiwan can buy overseas stocks only through the purchase of mutual funds issued * by local and foreign investment trusts.
The new rules will allow investors to buy foreign stocks directly.
A spokesman for Shearson said 0 the brokerage service will be directed *-1 at individual investors who *T*-2 want *PRO*-3 to buy foreign and domestic stocks.
"It's an attractive market with good growth opportunities," he added *T*-1.
The Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation, following Malaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin's long - awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties.
On Friday, Datuk Daim added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on Malaysia's proposed budget for 1990 by *PRO*-3 ordering the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange "*PRO*-1 to take appropriate action immediately" *PRO*-2 to cut its links with the Stock Exchange of Singapore.
The delisting of Malaysian - based companies from the Singapore exchange may not be a smooth process, analysts say 0 *T*-1.
Though the split has long been expected *-1, the exchanges aren't fully prepared *-2 *PRO*-3 to go their separate ways.
The finance minister's order wasn't sparked *-1 by a single event and doesn't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries.
Rather, the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years, with a nearly five - year - old moratorium on new dual listings, separate and different listing requirements, differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national - policy aims.
Appalachian Power Co., a subsidiary of American Electric Power Co., said 0 it will redeem on Dec. 1 the entire $44.2 million *U* of its 12 7/8% first mortgage bonds due 2013.
The redemption price will be 109.66% of the principal amount of the bonds, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption.
President Bush insists 0 it would be a great tool for *PRO* curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs.
He wants it now.
Not so fast, says *T*-1 Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, a fellow Republican.
"I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century," he says *T*-1.
It's the line - item veto, a procedure that *T*-1 would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed * by Congress without *PRO*-2 vetoing the entire bill.
Whatever one thinks *T*-1 of the idea, it's far more than the budgetary gimmick 0 it may seem *-3 *T*-2 at first glance.
Rather, it's a device that *T*-1 could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way 0 the government does its business *T*-3.
President Bush badly wants a line - item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president.
Now the White House is declaring that he might not rely on Congress--which *T*-1 hasn't shown any willingness *PRO* to surrender such authority--*PRO*-3 to pass the line - item veto law 0 he seeks *T*-2.
White House spokesmen last week said 0 Mr. Bush is considering *PRO*-2 simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power, exercising a line - item veto and inviting a court challenge 0 *PRO* to decide whether he has the right *T*-1.
Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington, it would set off a political earthquake.
"The ramifications are enormous," says *T*-2 Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat who *T*-1 is a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee.
"It's a real face - to - face arm wrestling challenge to Congress."
White House aides know 0 it's a step that *T*-2 can't be taken *-1 lightly--and for that reason, the president may back down from *PRO*-3 launching a test case this year.
Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital - gains tax cut and a budget - reduction bill looming, Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress.
They prefer *PRO*-1 to put off the line - item veto until at least next year.
Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn *-1 to the idea of *PRO*-2 trying out a line - item veto.
The issue arose last week when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case *T*-1.
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea, but cautioned that there wasn't a firm decision *PRO* to try it.
Mr. Bush, former President Reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line - item veto would go a long way in *PRO* restoring discipline to the budget process.
They maintain that a president needs the ability *PRO* to surgically remove pork - barrel spending projects that *T*-2 are attached *-1 to big omnibus spending bills.
Those bills can't easily be vetoed *-1 in their entirety because they often are needed *-2 to keep the government operating.
Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line - item veto 0 *PRO* to use *T*-1 on state budgets.
More provocatively, some conservative legal theorists have begun *-1 arguing that Mr. Bush doesn't need *-2 to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution.
They base their argument on a clause buried * in Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution that *T*-1 states: "Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary *T*-2 (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented *-3 to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved *-3 by him or...disapproved *-3 by him...."
This clause, they argue 0 *?*, is designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to go beyond an earlier clause specifying that the president can veto a "bill," and is broad enough *PRO* to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills.
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.), for one, accepts this argument and earlier this year publicly urged Mr. Bush "*PRO*-1 to use the line - item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional."
There's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged *-1 in court--and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court *PRO*-2 to be ultimately resolved *-3.
"It's a major issue, and they wouldn't want *PRO*-2 to leave it at a lower level," says *T*-3 Stephen Glazier, a New York attorney whose writings *T*-1 have been instrumental in *PRO* pushing the idea that a president already has a line - item veto.
Rep. Edwards, the California Democrat, is one who *T*-1 pledges that he would immediately challenge Mr. Bush in the courts, *PRO*-2 arguing 0 a line - item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything 0 the framers of the Constitution had *T*-3 in mind.
"It puts this president in the legislative business," he declares *T*-1.
"That's not what our fathers had *T*-1 in mind."
In addition to *PRO*-3 giving a president powers *PRO* to rewrite spending bills meant *PRO* to be written *-1 in Congress, Rep. Edwards argues 0 *?*, a line - item veto would allow the chief executive to blackmail lawmakers.
He notes that, as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area, he fights each year *PRO*-1 to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.
If a president had a line - item veto and wanted *PRO*-1 to force him *PRO*-2 to support a controversial foreign - policy initiative, Rep. Edwards says 0 *?*, the president could call and declare that he would single - handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign - policy issue.
Proponents maintain that a president would choose *PRO*-1 to use a line - item veto more judiciously than that.
But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst 0 it would cause *T*-1, it mightn't be effective in *PRO* cutting the deficit.
Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected *-1.
Governors have found that they have *-1 to use the device sparingly *PRO*-1 to maintain political comity.
And it *EXP*-4 isn't even clear that some pork - barrel projects can be hit *-1 with a line - item veto because they tend *-3 to be listed *-2 in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves.
Still, proponents contend that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 an important "chilling effect" on all manner of appropriations bills.
Lawmakers, they say 0 *?*, would avoid *PRO*-3 putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of *PRO* having them singled *-2 out for a line - item veto later.
Whatever the outcome of a test case *T*-4, President Bush would have *-2 to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans," says *T*-3 Louis Fisher, a scholar at the Congressional Research Service who *T*-1 specializes in executive - legislative relations.
Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in "the way 0 the system works *T*-1," he notes 0 *T*-2.
Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line - item veto, some, *PRO*-1 ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed.
Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it *EXP*-1's a mistake *PRO* to put too much power in the hands of a single person.
Conservatives pushing for a line - item veto now, he notes 0 *?*, may regret it later: "Sometime, you're going *-3 to have a Democratic president *ICH*-1 again" who *T*-4'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives.
"Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary *T*-1 (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented *-2 to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved *-2 by him, or *PRO*-2 being disapproved *-3 by him, shall be repassed *-2 by two - thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed * in the case of a bill."
UNDER A PROPOSAL *ICH*-1 by Democrats *PRO* to expand Individual Retirement Accounts, a $2,000 *U* contribution by a taxpayer in the 33% bracket would save $330 *U* on his taxes.
The savings was given *-1 incorrectly in Friday's edition.
Lockheed Corp. said 0 it will trim its Aeronautical Systems work force in California and Georgia by several hundred workers, *PRO* reflecting the defense industry's decline.
The Lockheed unit has 24,000 workers; it expects *PRO*-1 to make the cuts through a combination of furloughs, attrition and retirements.
The reductions should be complete by the end of the year, a spokesman said 0 *T*-3, *PRO*-4 adding that the exact number 0 *T*-5 to be cut *-2 hasn't been determined *-1.
Lockheed reported a $32 million *U* third - quarter net loss, largely because of cost overruns on fixed - price military contracts.
*PRO*-1 Noting that other defense contractors are complaining of losses on such contracts, analysts say 0 taxpayers have been getting illusionary bargains on weapons systems in recent years.
Defense contractors "cannot continue *-1 to get contracts on that basis," said 0 *T*-2 Howard Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York.
"The pain is too great.
Bruce W. Wilkinson, president and chief executive officer, was named *-1 to the additional post of chairman of this architectural and design services concern.
Mr. Wilkinson, 45 years old, succeeds Thomas A. Bullock, 66, who *T*-1 is retiring as chairman but will continue as a director and chairman of the executive committee.
The head of the nation's largest car - dealers group is telling dealers *PRO*-1 to "just say no" when auto makers pressure them *PRO*-3 to stockpile cars on their lots *T*-2.
In an open letter that *T*-1 will run today in the trade journal Automotive News, Ron Tonkin, president of the National Car Dealers Association, says 0 dealers should cut their inventories to no more than half the level traditionally considered *PRO* desirable.
Mr. Tonkin, who *T*-1 has been feuding with the Big Three since he took office earlier this year, said that with half of the nation's dealers losing money or breaking even, it was time for "emergency action."
U.S. car dealers had an average of 59 days' supply of cars in their lots at the end of September, according to Ward's Automotive Reports.
But Mr. Tonkin said 0 dealers should slash stocks to between 15 and 30 days *PRO*-1 to reduce the costs of *PRO*-2 financing inventory.
His message is getting a chilly reception in Detroit, where the Big Three auto makers are already being forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to close plants because of soft sales and reduced dealer orders *T*-2.
Even before Mr. Tonkin's broadside, some large dealers said 0 they were cutting inventories.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. representatives criticized Mr. Tonkin's plan as unworkable.
It "is going *-1 to sound neat to the dealer *NOT* except when his 15 - day car supply doesn't include the bright red one that the lady wants *PRO*-3 to buy *T*-2 *T*-4 and she goes up the street *PRO*-5 to buy one *T*-4," a Chrysler spokesman said *T*-6.
Rally's Inc. said 0 it filed suit in U.S. District Court in Delaware against a group led * by Burt Sugarman, *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to block the investors from *PRO*-3 buying more shares.
Rally's, a Louisville, Ky., fast - food chain, alleges that the three investors, who *T*-1 are directors of the company, broke securities laws because they didn't disclose their intentions *PRO* to acquire a big Rally's stake.
The group, led * by Giant Group Ltd. and its chairman, Mr. Sugarman, owns about 45.2% of Rally's.
In the Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the group has said 0 it may seek control of Rally's.
Mr. Sugarman called the lawsuit "*PRO*-2 not nice" and said 0 his group will continue *-1 to push for control of the company and the removal of certain directors.
He asserts that some directors, who *T*-1 have joined forces with company founder James Patterson, have ties to Wendy's, a competing hamburger chain.
The Patterson group, which *T*-1 controls about 42% of Rally's shares, also may seek control.
Rally's also said 0 it formed a committee of three directors, who *T*-1 aren't associated *-3 with either the Patterson or Sugarman groups, 0 *T*-2 to analyze the situation.
Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand brewing and retail concern, said Friday that Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd. is "committed" *-1 to a transaction whereby Lion Nathan would acquire 50% of Bond's Australian brewing assets *T*-2.
Lion Nathan issued a statement saying 0 it is applying to Australia's National Companies & Securities Commission, the nation's corporate watchdog agency, for a modification to takeover regulations "similar to that obtained * by" S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd.
SA Brewing, an Australian brewer, last Thursday was given *-1 approval 0 *PRO* to acquire an option for up to 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp *T*-2.
Bell Resources is acquiring Bond's brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.9 billion *U*).
S.A. brewing would make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, according to the commission.
Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources company, is selling many of its assets *PRO*-1 to reduce its debts.
"Lion Nathan has a concluded contract with Bond and Bell Resources," said *T*-1 Douglas Myers, chief executive of Lion Nathan.
The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's chief oil futures marketplace, is at a critical juncture.
Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think 0 the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined *-1 to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does *T*-3 and how successful its new president is *T*-2 in *PRO*-4 raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules.
If the exchange falters in these moves, they say 0 *?*, it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange.
On Friday, the Merc's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co.'s Henry Hub in Erath, La., as the delivery site for its long - awaited natural gas futures contract.
It also said that it would start *-1 trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it.
The CFTC has 90 days 0 *PRO* to respond to such applications *T*-1.
The Merc first started *-1 working on *PRO*-2 developing this contract in 1984.
Only three weeks earlier, the Merc had turned to one of its own executives, 40 - year - old R. Patrick Thompson, *PRO* to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president.
Mr. Thompson is believed *-2 to have a mandate *ICH*-3 from the board of directors *PRO* to help *PRO*-4 improve the Merc's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders *T*-1 don't follow the rules very well.
Ms. McFadden had been forced *-1 out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman, chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange.
Mr. Guttman told one person familiar with the New York exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who *T*-1 would be "responsive to the needs of the membership and the board."
Mr. Thompson first came to the exchange in 1981 and has been executive vice president since March 1988.
He previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel.
By contrast, the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider, Arnold F. Staloff, as its president.
Mr. Staloff, 44, was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered *-1 a specialist in new financial products.
Mr. Thompson isn't bereft of experience with new products, however.
For the past two years, he said 0 *?*, he and the exchange's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract, *PRO*-2 seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market.
"Our members are eager *PRO*-1 to begin *-2 trading this contract, so we expect no difficulty in *PRO* attracting locals to the natural gas pit," he said 0 *T*-3.
The educational effort of *PRO* teaching companies in the natural gas industry how *PRO*-5 to use the futures *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to hedge would have *-3 to continue for another a year or two, he added 0 *T*-4.
The Merc's extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York, and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
In a recent interview, Mr. Thompson said 0 the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image.
Earlier this year, the U.S. attorney indicted 45 floor traders *RNR*-1 and one clerk *RNR*-1 at the two big Chicago exchanges.
Federal authorities in New York started investigating exchanges in May, though no indictments have been handed down *-1 there.
So far they have issued scores of subpoenas, some of which *T*-1 went to members of the New York Merc.
Mr. Thompson will have *-1 to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas.
In a recent General Accounting Office study, the Merc was found *-1 to have been the most lax in *PRO* enforcing exchange rules.
It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied * over the past five years.
It also had both the fewest, and least experienced, investigators per million contracts traded *.
The Merc received considerable criticism in 1987 when it was discovered that its compliance director, Kevin P. Conway, who *T*-4 then was responsible for *PRO* policing the exchange's busy oil and metal pits, "was engaged *-3 in other personal business activities *ICH*-1 on Exchange time," including out - of - state trips, according to a New York Merc report prepared * last year *T*-6.
Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange.
"We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance," Mr. Thompson says *T*-1.
"We recognized the problem and took care of it."
He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly, the 1990 business plan calls for *PRO* having adequate compliance people 0 *T*-2 to ensure that exchange rules are being followed *-1.
For years the five New York exchanges have been talking about *PRO* cooperating in various aspects of their business in order *PRO*-1 to improve the efficiency of their operations.
Periodically, there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges.
So far there is little 0 *PRO* to show *T*-1 for such efforts.
Mr. Thompson believes 0 the case for *PRO* working together is stronger *ICH*-1 now than ever.
"The cost of competition has become extremely high," he says *T*-1.
"We must find ways 0 *PRO* to save money for the futures commission merchants who *T*-1 do business on our exchanges *T*-2."
He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made *-1 in areas where no vested interests have built up *T*-2.
One of those areas is the development of a hand - held electronic device that *T*-1 would permit floor traders *PRO*-2 to enter trades as they make them.
The GAO has recommended the creation of a system 0 *PRO* to record trade data *T*-2 so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established *-1 *PRO* to prevent customer fraud.
The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in *PRO* developing such a device 0 *T*-1 to provide such an audit trail.
The Chicago exchanges also are working on such a device.
Another major electronics problem *ICH*-2 faces Mr. Thompson--the creation of a 24 - hour trading system that *T*-4 can be used *-3 outside normal trading hours.
In January, the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to *PRO* joining their electronic system 0 *T*-1 called *PRO*-2 *PRO*-3 Globex.
But in May, the Chicago Merc said 0 it was looking into *PRO*-1 creating a common system with the Chicago Board of Trade, and it suspended negotiations with the New York Merc.
Mr. Thompson says 0 his exchange isn't waiting for the results of the Chicago exchanges' cooperation.
It recently began a pilot program 0 *T*-1 to test an electronic trading system called *PRO* *PRO*-2 ATS / 2, the automated trading system created * by the International Commodities Clearing House.
*PRO* Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
Copper
Michael Frawley, metals trader for PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said 0 there is good technical support between $1.10 and $1.12 *U* a pound for December copper, which *T*-1 ended Friday at $1.1580 *U* a pound, up 1.6 cents.
He views the $1.10 to $1.12 *U* range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold *-1.
"I think 0 the market could pop up to the $1.22 to $1.25 *U* level without too much difficulty," he said *T*-1.
But he said 0 it won't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $1.10 and $1.25 *U*.
He noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on Wall Street.
William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said 0 for a rally to occur, there must be demand from the Far East.
He added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted *-1.
However, *PRO*-1 to resume the bull trend, according to Mr. O'Neill, copper would have *-1 to close over $1.19 *U*.
He said 0 there are two reports *ICH*-2 *ICH*-3 this week that *T*-1 might affect prices: the purchasing managers report on Wednesday and the unemployment report on Friday.
Precious Metals
Friday's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets, according to PaineWebber's Mr. Frawley.
"Most traders will be looking *PRO*-1 to buy {on} pullbacks," he said *T*-2.
He thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced *-1 by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets.
According to Mr. Frawley, floor traders say 0 there is good support for December gold in the $374 to $375 *U* per ounce area, around $5.20 *U* an ounce for December silver and in the $485 to $490 *U* an ounce range for January platinum.
William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said the price action for all of last week is the best 0 he has seen *T*-1 on a weekly basis in more than a year.
He said 0 last week's activity in gold could portend a move to $390 *U* an ounce for the December contract.
He also said 0 traders should keep an eye on the stock market, because "if the stock market rallies, that could spell trouble for the precious metals."
He said 0 traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally *T*-1.
"I expect *PRO*-1 to see some selling, but will they kill this one as they have *?* every rally in the recent past" by *PRO*-2 selling and locking in prices for their production?
He noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals.
Grains And Soybeans
Prices this week will likely be dominated *-1 by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of U.S. crops by the Soviet Union.
In recent weeks, warm and dry weather has sped the Midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers *PRO*-3 to rebuild the stockpiles that *T*-2 were cut *-1 by the 1988 drought.
If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many Midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the Chicago Board of Trade in order *PRO*-1 to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers.
That selling of futures contracts by elevators is what *T*-1 helps *PRO*-2 keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest.
Traders will also watch for whether the Soviet Union continues its traditional fall buying of U.S. grain.
So far this month, the Soviets have bought about 7.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
There may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try *PRO*-1 to get rid of the contract for November delivery.
Investors usually don't want *PRO*-1 to take physical delivery of a contract, *PRO*-1 preferring instead *PRO*-2 to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation *PRO* to take delivery or make delivery as it nears expiration.
Leaseway Transportation Corp. said 0 it will restructure $192.5 million *U* of certain subordinated debentures *PRO*-1 to reduce its debt obligations and interest expense.
The 13.25% subordinated debentures due 2002 were issued *-1 in August 1987 as part of the $690 million *U* financing for a leveraged buy - out of the company.
Leaseway provides transportation services for manufacturers, distributors and retailers.
Leaseway said 0 it has begun discussions with certain institutional debt holders 0 *PRO* to review the proposed private placement transaction, which *T*-1 would exchange the debt for new subordinated debt instruments and equity securities *T*-2.
Specific terms are subject to review and a final agreement with debt holders, the company said 0 *T*-1.
But the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face value and reduced cash interest.
Also, debt holders would be offered *-2 an equity position in Leaseway, which in total *T*-3 would represent a controlling interest in the company.
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is the adviser on the transaction.
Company officials said 0 Leaseway fulfilled payment requirements of its debt obligations since the leveraged buy - out, but 0 "our performance since the {buy - out} makes it *EXP*-2 imperative *PRO* to implement actions that *T*-1 will further improve our cash flow.
Federal investigators have identified the problem in last July's crash of a United Airlines flight in Iowa: a structural flaw that *T*-1 developed during the making of a titanium engine disk.
For several months, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have suspected that a metallurgical flaw in the disk led to a crack that *T*-1 ultimately caused the tail engine to break apart in flight.
The explosion sent shards of metal flying, *PRO*-1 severing the DC - 10's hydraulic or control systems, and led to the crash that *T*-11 killed 112 people.
But investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent retrieval of a big chunk of Flight 232's tail engine from a cornfield near the Sioux City Airport in Iowa.
The safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in Sioux City.
Among the issues 0 the board will examine *T*-1 is *T*-2 whether United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., should have been able *PRO*-3 to detect the cracks through maintenance checks.
The engine involved * was a CF6 - 6 made * by General Electric Co.
Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw--known * as "hard alpha"--occurred in the titanium during its production almost 20 years ago.
He said 0 there wasn't any way 0 *PRO* to detect the flaw at that time *T*-1, and that the process has since been changed *-2 *PRO* to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur.
The FAA already has ordered that all 232 disks made * by the old process be removed *-1 from the planes and subjected *-1 to an ultrasonic test in a water - submersion chamber.
Such tests make the FAA confident that a Sioux City - type accident "won't happen again," said 0 *T*-1 Mr. Broderick.
A spokesman for GE said that the company has been working with the FAA all along on this issue and "will comply fully with the required inspections."
But he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on GE's engine production.
The CF6 - 6 series engines aren't being manufactured *-11 any more; they are only being used *-12 in the DC - 10 Series 10 planes currently in service, he said 0 *T*-1.
General Motors Corp.'s general counsel hopes *PRO*-1 to cut the number of outside law firms 0 the auto maker uses *T*-2 from about 700 to 200 within two years.
Harry J. Pearce, named *PRO* *PRO*-3 general counsel in May 1987, says 0 the reduction is a cost - cutting measure and an effort *PRO* to let the No. 1 auto maker's 134 - lawyer in - house legal department take on matters 0 it is better equipped and trained *PRO*-2 to handle *T*-1.
GM trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list, Mr. Pearce says 0 *T*-1.
The move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in - house, instead of *PRO*-1 farming it out to law firms.
Mr. Pearce set up GM's first in - house litigation group in May with four lawyers, all former assistant U.S. attorneys with extensive trial experience.
He intends *PRO*-1 to add to the litigation staff.
Among the types of cases 0 the in - house litigators handle *T*-2 are *T*-1 disputes involving companies doing business with GM and product - related actions, including one in which a driver is suing GM for damages resulting from an accident *T*-3.
Mr. Pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with GM's technical staffs *PRO*-1 to help prevent future litigation.
GM lawyers have been working with technicians *PRO*-2 to develop more uniform welding procedures--the way 0 a vehicle is welded *-1 *T*-3 has a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-4 with its durability.
The lawyers also monitor suits *PRO*-2 to identify specific automobile parts that *T*-1 cause the biggest legal problems.
Mr. Pearce says law firms with the best chance of *PRO* retaining or winning business with GM will be those providing the highest - quality service at the best cost--*PRO*-1 echoing similar directives from GM's auto operations to suppliers.
This doesn't necessarily mean 0 larger firms have an advantage; Mr. Pearce said 0 GM works with a number of smaller firms 0 it regards *T*-1 highly.
Mr. Pearce has shaken up GM's legal staff by *PRO*-2 eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions, including a special - projects group that *T*-1 has made films on safety and drunk driving.
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials.
That's a finding of a new study of the Justice Department by researchers at Syracuse University.
David Burnham, one of the authors, says 0 fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains.
In 1980, 18% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial; in 1987, only 9% did *?*.
The study covered 11 major U.S. attorneys' offices--including those in Manhattan and Brooklyn, N.Y., and New Jersey--from 1980 to 1987.
The Justice Department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing *PRO*-1 to plea bargain.
"Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years," with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial, a department spokeswoman said 0 *T*-1.
The discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the Syracuse researchers said 0 they based their conclusions on government statistics.
"One possible explanation for this decline" in *PRO* taking cases to trial, says 0 *?* Mr. Burnham, "is that the number of defendants being charged * with crimes by all U.S. attorneys has substantially increased."
In 1980, the study says 0 *?*, prosecutors surveyed * filed charges against 25 defendants for each 100,000 people aged 18 years and older.
In 1987, prosecutors filed against 35 defendants for every 100,000 adults.
Another finding from the study: Prosecutors set significantly different priorities.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987, *PRO*-1 averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults.
But the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16.
On the civil side, the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period; the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79.
The study is *-1 to provide reporters, academic experts and others raw data on which *PRO* to base further inquiries *T*-2.
IMELDA MARCOS asks for dismissal, says 0 she was kidnapped *-1.
The former first lady of the Philippines, asked a federal court in Manhattan *PRO*-2 to dismiss an indictment against her, *PRO*-3 claiming among other things, that she was abducted *-1 from her homeland.
Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, were charged *-1 with *PRO*-2 embezzling more than $100 million *U* from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in Manhattan.
Mrs. Marcos's attorneys asked federal Judge John F. Keenan *PRO*-1 to give them access to all U.S. documents about her alleged abduction.
The U.S. attorney's office, in documents 0 it filed *T*-2 in response, said 0 Mrs. Marcos was making the "fanciful--and factually unsupported--claim that she was kidnapped *-1 into this country" in order *PRO*-3 to obtain classified material in the case.
The office also said 0 Mrs. Marcos and her husband weren't brought *-2 to the U.S. against their will after Mr. Marcos was ousted *-1 as president.
The prosecutor quoted statements from the Marcoses in which they said 0 they were in this country at the invitation of President Reagan and that they were enjoying the hospitality of the U.S. *T*-1.
Lawyers for Mrs. Marcos say that because she was taken *-1 to the U.S. against her wishes, the federal court lacks jurisdiction in the case.
THE FEDERAL COURT of appeals in Manhattan ruled that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former Bank of Crete owner George Koskotas should be reconsidered *-1.
The indictment, which *T*-1 was sealed *-2 and apparently forgotten *-2 by investigators until 1987, charges Mr. Koskotas and three others with tax fraud and other violations.
He made numerous trips to the U.S. in the early 1980s, but wasn't arrested *-2 until 1987 when he showed up as a guest of then - Vice President George Bush at a government function *T*-1.
A federal judge in Manhattan threw out the indictment, *PRO*-1 finding that the seven - year delay violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial.
The appeals court, however, said 0 the judge didn't adequately consider whether the delay would actually hurt the chances of a fair trial.
Mr. Koskotas is fighting extradition proceedings that *T*-2 would return him to Greece, where he is charged *-1 with *PRO*-4 embezzling more than $250 million *U* from the Bank of Crete *T*-3.
His attorney couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
PRO BONO VOLUNTARISM: In an effort *PRO* to stave off a plan that *T*-1 would require all lawyers in New York state *PRO*-3 to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year, the state bar recommended an alternative program 0 *T*-2 to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs.
The state bar association's policy making body, the House of Delegate, voted Saturday *PRO*-1 to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler *PRO*-2 to give the bar's voluntary program three years 0 *PRO* to prove its effectiveness before *PRO*-4 considering mandatory pro bono *T*-3.
"We believe 0 our suggested plan is more likely *PRO*-2 to improve the availability of quality legal service to the poor than is the proposed mandatory pro bono plan *?* and will achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction, administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear 0 *T*-3 would accompany an attempt *PRO* to impose a mandatory plan," said *T*-4 Justin L. Vigdor of Rochester, who *T*-1 headed the bar's pro bono study committee.
DALLAS AND HOUSTON law firms merge: Jackson & Walker, a 130 - lawyer firm in Dallas and Datson & Scofield, a 70 - lawyer firm in Houston said 0 they have agreed in principle *PRO*-1 to merge.
The consolidated firm, which *T*-1 would rank among the 10 largest in Texas, would operate under the name Jackson & Walker.
The merger must be formally approved *-2 by the partners of both firms but is expected *-2 to be completed *-1 by year end.
Jackson & Walker has an office in Fort Worth, Texas, and Dotson & Scofield has an office in New Orleans.
*PRO* PILING ON?
*PRO*-1 Piggybacking on government assertions that General Electric Co. may have covered up fraudulent billings to the Pentagon, two shareholders have filed a civil racketeering suit against the company.
The suit was filed *-1 by plaintiffs' securities lawyer Richard D. Greenfield in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.
He seeks damages from the company's 15 directors on grounds that they either "participated in *RNR*-1 or condoned *RNR*-1 the illegal acts...or utterly failed *-2 to carry out their duties as directors."
GE is defending itself against government criminal charges of fraud and false claims in connection with a logistics - computer contract for the Army.
The trial begins today in federal court in Philadelphia.
The government's assertions of the cover - up were made *-1 in last minute pretrial motions.
GE, which *T*-1 vehemently denies the government's allegations, denounced Mr. Greenfield's suit.
"It is a cheap - shot suit--procedurally defective and thoroughly fallacious--which *T*-1 was hurriedly filed *-3 by a contingency - fee lawyer as a result of newspaper reports," said *T*-2 a GE spokeswoman.
She added that the company was considering *PRO*-1 bringing sanctions against Mr. Greenfield for *PRO*-2 making "grossly inaccurate and unsupported allegations.
Nelson Holdings International Ltd. shareholders approved a 1 - for - 10 consolidation of the company's common stock at a special meeting.
At the same time, shareholders approved the adoption of a rights plan and a super-majority voting approval requirement.
They also approved the relocation of the company's registered office to Toronto from Vancouver and a name change to NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd.
Following the consolidation, the entertainment company, which *T*-1 has film and television operations in Beverly Hills, Calif., will have about 4.1 million shares outstanding.
The number of authorized common shares will remain at 100 million.
Under the rights plan, holders will have one right for each common share held *, with each right entitling the purchase of one common share for 100 Canadian dollars.
The rights plan would be triggered *-1 if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the common shares outstanding without *PRO*-2 making an offer to all shareholders.
Under the super-majority amendment, certain mergers and other transactions would require approval of holders of 80% of the company's common shares outstanding.
The Treasury Department said 0 the U.S. trade deficit may worsen next year, after two years of significant improvement.
In its report to Congress on international economic policies, the Treasury said that any improvement in the broadest measure of trade, known * as the current account, "is likely at best *-1 to be very modest," and "the possibility of deterioration in the current account next year cannot be excluded *-2."
The statement was the U.S. government's first acknowledgement of what other groups, such as the International Monetary Fund, have been predicting *T*-1 for months.
Continued strength in the dollar was cited *-1 as one reason 0 the trade position may deteriorate *T*-2.
The Treasury's report, which *T*-2 is required *-1 annually by a provision of the 1988 trade act, again took South Korea to task for its exchange - rate policies.
"We believe that there have continued *-3 to be indications of exchange - rate ` manipulation"' during the past six months, it said 0 *T*-2, *PRO*-1 citing the lack of market forces in South Korea's exchange - rate system and the use *ICH*-4 of capital and interest - rate controls *PRO* to manipulate exchange rates.
The Treasury expressed pleasure, however, with the government of Taiwan, which *T*-2 was cited *-1 for exchange - rate manipulation in last year's report.
The Treasury said 0 Taiwan has liberalized its exchange rate system in the past year.
Southern Co.'s Gulf Power Co. unit may plead guilty this week to charges that it illegally steered company money to politicians through outside vendors, according to individuals close to an investigation of the utility holding company.
The tentative settlement between Gulf Power, a Pensacola, Fla., electric company, and federal prosecutors would mark the end of one part of a wide - ranging inquiry of Southern Co. in the past year.
A grand jury has been investigating whether officials at Southern Co. conspired *PRO*-1 to cover up their accounting for spare parts *PRO*-2 to evade federal income taxes.
The grand jury has also been investigating whether Gulf Power executives violated the federal Utility Holding Company Act, which *T*-1 prohibits certain utilities from *PRO*-2 making political contributions.
The individuals said 0 Gulf Power and federal prosecutors are considering a settlement under which the company would plead guilty to two felony charges and pay fines totaling between $500,000 and $1.5 million *U* *T*-1.
Under one count, Gulf Power would plead guilty to *PRO*-2 conspiring *PRO*-1 to violate the Utility Holding Company Act.
Under the second count, the company would plead guilty to *PRO*-2 conspiring *PRO*-1 to evade taxes.
The guilty pleas would be made *-1 solely by Gulf Power, the individuals said 0 *T*-2.
No employee or vendor would be involved *-1.
A spokesman for Southern Co. would say only that discussions *ICH*-1 are continuing between Gulf Power and federal prosecutors.
"We have no further developments 0 *PRO* to report *T*-2," he said *T*-1.
Officials at Gulf Power couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
And prosecutors declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
While Southern Co. has been reluctant *PRO*-2 to discuss the grand jury investigations, Edward L. Addison, chief executive officer, has said 0 the company is prepared *PRO*-3 to defend its tax and acccounting practices if any charges are brought *-1 against it.
Morever, Mr. Addison has said 0 Southern Co. and its units don't condone illegal political contributions.
Neither Mr. Addison nor any other Southern Co. official has been charged *-1 with any wrongdoing in connection with the current inquiries.
The probe of Southern Co. has attracted considerable attention this year because of several events that *T*-1 have befallen the company, including the death of a Gulf Power executive in a plane crash and the disappearance of a company vendor who *T*-2 was *-3 to be a key grand jury witness.
Witnesses have said 0 the grand jury has asked numerous questions about Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, the senior vice president of Gulf Power who *T*-1 died in the plane crash in April.
Mr. Horton oversaw Gulf Power's governmental - affairs efforts.
On the morning of the crash, he had been put *-1 on notice that an audit committee was recommending his dismissal because of invoicing irregularities in a company audit.
Investigators have been trying *PRO*-1 to determine whether the crash was an accident, sabotage or suicide.
Gulf Power said in May that an internal audit had disclosed that at least one vendor had used false invoices *PRO*-1 to fund political causes.
But the company said 0 the political contributions had been made *-1 more than five years ago.
As competition heats up in Spain's crowded bank market, Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking *PRO*-1 to shed its image of a state - owned bank and move into new activities.
Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say 0 *T*-1 may be the first step toward the bank's privatization.
The state - owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94% stake in Banco Exterior.
The government directly owns 51.4% and Factorex, a financial services company, holds 8.42%.
The rest is listed *-1 on Spanish stock exchanges.
Some analysts are concerned, however, that Banco Exterior may have waited too long *PRO*-1 to diversify from its traditional export - related activities.
*PRO* Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services, they argue 0 *?*, will be difficult, particularly if market conditions turn sour.
If that proves *-5 true, analysts say 0 Banco Exterior could be a prime partner--or even a takeover target--for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking *PRO* to increase its market share after 1992, when the European Community plans *PRO*-3 to dismantle financial barriers *T*-4.
With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries, five branches and 12 representative offices abroad, the Banco Exterior group has a lot 0 *PRO* to offer a potential suitor *T*-1.
Mr. Luzon and his team, however, say 0 they aren't interested in a merger.
Instead, they are working *PRO*-1 to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992.
"I want this to be a model of the way 0 a public - owned company should be run *-1 *T*-3," Mr. Luzon says *T*-2.
Banco Exterior was created *-1 in 1929 *PRO*-1 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports.
The market for export financing was liberalized *-1 in the mid-1980s, however, *PRO* forcing the bank *PRO*-2 to face competition.
At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth.
As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ($7.04 billion *U*) as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas.
The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business--wholesale banking and foreign currency trading--also began *-1 to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs.
The bank was hamstrung *-1 in its efforts *PRO* to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government, analysts say 0 *T*-2.
Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November, Banco Exterior was run *-1 by politicians who *T*-2 lacked either the skills *RNR*-3 or the will *RNR*-3 0 *PRO* to introduce innovative changes *T*-4.
But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly *PRO*-1 to streamline bureaucracy, cut costs, increase capital and build up new areas of business.
"We've got a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2," he acknowledged *T*-1.
"We've got *-1 to move quickly."
In Mr. Luzon's first year, the bank eliminated 800 jobs.
Now it says 0 it'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years.
The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad.
*PRO*-1 To strengthen its capital base, Banco Exterior this year issued $105 million *U* in subordinated debt, launched two rights issues and sold stock held * in its treasury to small investors.
The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches.
Last year's drop in export credit was partially offset *-1 by a 15% surge in lending to individuals and small and medium - sized companies.
Though Spain has an excess of banks, analysts say 0 the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe, which *T*-1 will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks 0 it faces *T*-2 ahead.
Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets.
The bank says 0 it's interested in *PRO*-1 purchasing banks in Morocco, Portugal and Puerto Rico.
But the bank's retail activities in Latin America are likely *-1 to be cut *-2 back.
Banco Exterior was one of the last banks 0 *T*-1 to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July.
The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues *-1 to open up its market to foreign competition.
But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team 0 he brought *T*-1 with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where he was formerly director general *T*-2, will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992.
The bank also says 0 it'll use its international network *PRO* to channel investment from London, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges.
This maker of electronic devices said 0 it replaced all five incumbent directors at a special meeting called * by Milton B. Hollander, whose High Technology Holding Co. of Stamford, Conn. *T*-1 acquired most of its 49.4% stake in Newport in August.
Elected *-2 as directors were *T*-1 Mr. Hollander, Frederick Ezekiel, Frederick Ross, Arthur B. Crozier and Rose Pothier.
Removed *-2 from office were *T*-1 George Pratt, Robert E. Davis, Norman Gray, John Virtue, corporate secretary, and Barrett B. Weekes, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
Newport officials didn't respond Friday to requests *PRO* to discuss the changes at the company but earlier, Mr. Weekes had said 0 Mr. Hollander wanted *PRO*-1 to have his own team on the board.

QUANTUM CHEMICAL Corp.'s plant in Morris, Ill., is expected *-1 to resume production in early 1990.
The year was misstated *-1 in Friday's editions.
Kidder, Peabody & Co. is trying *PRO*-1 to struggle back.
Only a few months ago, the 124 - year - old securities firm seemed *-2 to be on the verge of a meltdown, *PRO*-2 racked *-1 by internal squabbles and defections.
Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed *-1 since a big Kidder insider - trading scandal two years ago.
Chief executives and presidents had come and gone.
Now, the firm says 0 it's at a turning point.
By the end of this year, 63 - year - old Chairman Silas Cathcart--the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who *T*-2 was derided *-1 as a "tool - and - die man" when GE brought him in *PRO*-4 to clean up Kidder in 1987 *T*-3--retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home, possibly *PRO*-6 to build a shopping mall on some land 0 he owns *T*-5.
"I've done what I came *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1" at Kidder, he says 0 *T*-3.
And that means 0 42 - year - old Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive since January, will for the first time take complete control of Kidder and try *PRO*-1 to make good on some grandiose plans.
Mr. Carpenter says 0 he will return Kidder to prominence as a great investment bank.
Wall Street is understandably skeptical.
Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year - earlier period, according to Securities Data Co.
It's quite a fall from the early 1980s, when Kidder still was counted *-1 as an investment - banking powerhouse *T*-2.
Gary S. Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, an executive search firm, said: "I'd like *PRO*-1 to see (Kidder) succeed.
But they have *-2 to attract good senior bankers who *T*-1 can bring in the business from day one."
In 1988, Kidder eked out a $46 million *U* profit, mainly because of severe cost cutting.
Its 1,400 - member brokerage operation reported an estimated $5 million *U* loss last year, although Kidder expects it to turn a profit this year.
In fact, Kidder is a minor player in just about every business 0 it does *T*-1 except computer - driven program trading; in that controversial business, only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder.
But even that niche is under attack, as several Wall Street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors.
Mr. Carpenter, a former consulting - firm executive who *T*-1 has a love for "task forces," says 0 he has done a "complete rethink" of Kidder in recent months.
There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm's operations.
More than 20 new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired *-1 since January.
The firm's brokerage force has been trimmed *-1 and its mergers - and - acquisitions staff increased *-2 to a record 55 people.
Mr. Carpenter says that when he assumes full control *T*-1, Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE.
One of GE's goals when it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986 *T*-2 was *PRO* to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate - finance unit, which *T*-1 has $42 billion *U* in assets.
The leveraged buy - out group of GE Capital now reports to Mr. Carpenter.
So far, instead of *PRO*-1 teaming up, GE Capital staffers and Kidder investment bankers have bickered.
Yet, says 0 *?* Mr. Carpenter, "We've really started *-1 to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody."
The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year, he says 0 *?*, though not all of them have panned out.
"We've had a good relationship with GE, which *T*-1 is the first time 0 you could say that *T*-2--uh, *PRO* let me withdraw that.
It's been a steadily improving relationship," says *T*-1 Mr. Carpenter.
Still, without many actual deals 0 *PRO* to show *T*-1 off, Kidder is left *-2 *PRO*-3 to stress that it finally has "a team" in place, and that everyone works harder.
A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late.
"We are working significantly longer and harder than *?* has been the case in the past," says *T*-1 Scott C. Newquist, Kidder's head of investment banking since June.
Everywhere, Kidder stresses the "*PRO* always working" theme.
A new in - house magazine, Kidder World--which *T*-1 will focus on the firm's synergy strategy, says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Carpenter--confides that on weekends Mr. Newquist "often gets value - added ideas while *PRO*-3 flying his single - engine Cessna Centurion on the way to Nantucket."
The firm's new head of mergers and acquisitions under Mr. Newquist, B.J. Megargel, talks of the opportunity *PRO* to "rebuild a franchise" at Kidder.
"The Kidder name is one of only six or seven that every CEO recognizes *T*-2 as a viable alternative" when *PRO*-4 considering a merger deal *T*-3, he says *T*-1.
Now, according to a Kidder World story about Mr. Megargel, all 0 the firm has *-2 to do *T*-1 is "position ourselves more in the deal flow."
With investment banking as Kidder's "lead business," where do Kidder's 42 - branch brokerage network and its 1,400 brokers fit in *T*-1?
Mr. Carpenter this month sold off Kidder's eight brokerage offices in Florida and Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch & Co., *PRO*-1 refueling speculation that Kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely.
Mr. Carpenter denies the speculation.
*PRO*-1 To answer the brokerage question, Kidder, in typical fashion, completed a task - force study.
The result: Kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies, much closer to the clientele of Goldman, Sachs & Co. than a *PRO* serve - the - world firm like Merrill Lynch or Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
Mr. Carpenter notes that these types of investors also are "sophisticated" enough *PRO*-1 not to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading.
As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20 - week training course, *PRO*-1 turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance.
They will get "new and improved tools 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-2, particularly to the affluent investor," says *T*-1 brokerage chief Charles V. Sheehan.
Theoretically, the brokers will then be able *PRO*-1 to funnel "leads" on corporate finance opportunities to Kidder's investment bankers, *PRO*-1 possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps.
However, skeptics caution that this kind of cross-pollination between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper, but doesn't always happen.
Kidder competitors aren't outwardly hostile to the firm, as many are *?* to a tough competitor like Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. that *T*-1 doesn't have Kidder's long history.
However, competitors say that Kidder's hiring binge involving executive - level staffers, some with multiple - year contract guarantees, could backfire unless there are results.
The departing Mr. Cathcart says 0 he has no worries about Kidder's future.
Mr. Cathcart, who *T*-2 will return to the Quaker Oats Co. board of directors, in addition to his personal ventures, is credited *-1 with *PRO*-3 bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free - wheeling Kidder.
He also improved the firm's compliance procedures for trading.
Mr. Cathcart says 0 he has had "a lot of fun" at Kidder, *PRO*-1 adding 0 the crack about his being a "tool - and - die man" never bothered him.
"It was an absolutely marvelous line and one 0 I used *T*-1 many times," he says *T*-2.
*PRO*-2 Smiling broadly when he talks about Mr. Carpenter *T*-3, Mr. Cathcart says 0 the new Kidder chief is "going *-4 to be recognized *-1 shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment - banking business."
In coming years, Mr. Cathcart says 0 *?*, Kidder is "gon *-2 na hum."
Or, as Mr. Carpenter, *PRO*-2 again drawing on his consulting - firm background, puts it: "We're ready *PRO*-1 to implement at this point.
NEC Corp., a Tokyo - based computer and electronics concern, said 0 net income rose 18% to 29.66 billion yen ($208.7 million *U*) in the fiscal first half, ended Sept. 30, from 25.12 billion yen a year earlier.

Insurers may see claims resulting from the San Francisco earthquake totaling nearly $1 billion *U*--far less than the claims 0 they face *T*-1 from Hurricane Hugo--but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months.
The property claims service division of the American Insurance Services Group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $960 million *U*.
This estimate doesn't include claims under workers' compensation, life, health disability and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges, highways and public buildings.
The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion *U* in claims that insurers face *T*-2 from Hurricane Hugo, which *T*-1 ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
That's because only about 30% of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance 0 *PRO* to cover the losses *T*-1.
However, insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co.'s refinery in Pasadena, Texas, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump.
Other insurance rates such as casualty insurance, which *T*-1 would cover liability claims, aren't likely *-2 to firm right away, says 0 *T*-3 Alice Cornish, an industry analyst with Northington Research in Avon, Conn.
She believes 0 the impact of losses from these catastrophes isn't likely *-1 to halt the growth of the industry's surplus capital next year.
Property reinsurance rates are likely *-1 to climb first, analysts and brokers believe 0 *T*-2.
"The reinsurance market has been bloodied *-2 by disasters" in the U.S. as well as in Great Britain and Europe, says 0 *T*-1 Thomas Rosencrants, director of research at Interstate / Johnson Lane Inc. in Atlanta.
Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks 0 they underwrite *T*-1 and pass on the rest of the losses.
Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by *PRO*-3 giving up a portion of the premiums 0 they collect *T*-2 on a policy to another firm--a reinsurance company, which, in turn, *T*-1 accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy.
Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S. - based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time.
After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had *-1 to tap reinsurers *PRO*-2 to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year.
After the earthquake two weeks ago, brokers say 0 companies scrambled *PRO*-1 to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own.
James Snedeker, senior vice president of Gill & Roeser Inc., a New York - based reinsurance broker, says 0 insurers who *T*-1 took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked *-2 *-3 *PRO*-5 to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want *PRO*-4 to buy reinsurance for 1990.
However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely *-1 to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly.
Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks.
"It's a seller's market," said *T*-1 Mr. Snedeker of the reinsurance market right now.
But some large insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program.
A few years ago, State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed *T*-2 and the company found it *EXP*-1 cheaper *PRO* to self - reinsure.
The $472 million *U* of losses 0 State Farm expects *T*-1 from Hugo and an additional $300 million *U* from the earthquake are less than 5% of State Farm's $16.7 billion *U* total net worth.
Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses *ICH*-5 they expect *PRO*-1 to see *T*-3 from the earthquake, it *EXP*-2's impossible *PRO* to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth - quarter earnings, said 0 *T*-4 Herbert Goodfriend at Prudential - Bache Securities Corp.
Transamerica expects an after - tax charge of less than $3 million *U* against fourth - quarter net; Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp., expects a $15 million *U* or 10 cents after - tax charge; and Fireman's Fund Corp. expects a charge of no more than $50 million *U* before taxes and after *PRO* using its reinsurance.
Costa Rica reached an agreement *ICH*-1 with its creditor banks that *T*-2 is expected *-3 to cut that government's $1.8 billion *U* in bank debt by as much as 60%.
The agreement was announced *-1 by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Friday, as President Bush and other leaders from the Western Hemisphere gathered in the Central American nation for a celebration of democracy.
Costa Rica had been negotiating with the U.S. and other banks for three years, but the debt plan was rushed *-1 to completion in order *PRO* to be announced *-2 at the meeting.
The government had fallen $300 million *U* behind in interest payments.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the agreement "*PRO*-5 an important step forward in the strengthened debt strategy," *PRO*-1 noting that it will "when *PRO*-3 implemented *-2 *T*-4, provide significant reduction in the level of debt and debt service owed * by Costa Rica."
Under the plan, Costa Rica will buy back roughly 60% of its bank debt outstanding at a deeply discounted price, according to officials involved * in the agreement.
The remainder of the debt will be exchanged *-1 for new Costa Rican bonds with a 6 1/4% interest rate.
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected *-2 to provide approximately $180 million *U* *PRO*-3 to help *PRO*-4 support the deal, and additional funds *ICH*-5 are expected *-1 from Japan.
Treasury officials say 0 the Costa Rican agreement demonstrates that the Brady debt plan can benefit small debtor countries as well as big debtors, such as Mexico.
Wall Street is just about ready *PRO*-1 to line the bird cage with paper stocks.
For three years, a healthy economy and the export - boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels.
As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp, a raw material used * in all sorts of paper, to $830 *U* a metric ton this past spring from $380 *U* a ton at the start of 1986.
But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply.
Third - quarter profits *ICH*-1 fell at several companies.
"*PRO* Put your money in a good utility or bank stock, not a paper company," advises *T*-1 George Adler of Smith Barney.
Other analysts are nearly as pessimistic.
Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. expects a 30% decline in earnings between now and 1991 for "commodity - oriented" paper companies, which *T*-1 account for the majority of the industry.
Robert Schneider of Duff & Phelps sees paper - company stock prices falling 10% to 15% *U* in 1990 *NOT* *NOT*, perhaps 25% if there's a recession.
Paper companies concede that business has been off recently.
But they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions.
Generally they maintain that, barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies, the industry isn't headed *-1 for a prolonged slump.
"It won't be an earthshaking drop," a Weyerhaeuser spokesman says *T*-1.
Last week Mr. Adler lowered his rating from hold to "avoid" on Boise Cascade, Champion International, Great Northern Nekoosa, International Paper, Louisiana Pacific and Weyerhaeuser.
Oppenheimer's Mr. Palmero, meanwhile, is steering clear of Gaylord Container, Stone Container and Federal Paper Board.
Mr. Schneider is cool to Georgia Pacific and Abitibi - Price.
Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber would avoid Union Camp.
The companies in question believe 0 the analysts are too pessimistic.
Great Northern Nekoosa said, "The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small."
International Paper emphasizes that it is better positioned than most companies for the coming overcapacity because its individual mills can make more than one grade of paper.
A Boise - Cascade spokesman referred to a speech by Chairman John Fery, in which he said that markets generally are stable, although some risk of further price deterioration exists *T*-1.
Stone Container Chairman Roger Stone said that, unlike for some other paper products, demand for Stone's principal commodity, unbleached containerboard, remains strong.
He expects the price for that product to rise even more next year.
Gaylord Container said 0 analysts are skeptical of it because it's carrying a lot of debt.
Champion International said, "We've gotten our costs down and we're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we've ever been *?*."
Louisiana Pacific and Georgia Pacific said 0 a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong wood - products business.
Federal Paper Board said, "We're not as exposed as the popular perception of us."
The company explained that its main product, bleached paperboard, which *T*-1 goes into some advertising materials and white boxes, historically doesn't have sharp price swings.
Because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump, PaineWebber's Mr. Ross says 0 he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only 5% to 10% *U*.
A company such as Federal Paper Board may be overly discounted *-2 and looks "tempting" to him, he says 0 *?*, though he isn't yet recommending the shares.
Wall Street isn't avoiding everything connected * with paper.
Mr. Palmero recommends Temple - Inland, *PRO*-1 explaining that it is "virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion," and thus should be able *PRO*-2 to lower long - term debt substantially next year.
A Temple - Inland spokesman said 0 the company expects record earnings in 1989, and "we're still pretty bullish" on 1990.
The analysts say 0 their gloomy forecasts have a flip side.
Some take a warm view of consumer - oriented paper companies, which *T*-1 buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices.
Estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year *T*-1 currently run between $150 and $250 *U* a metric ton.
Analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers, Scott Paper and Kimberly - Clark.
A spokesman for Scott says that *PRO* assuming 0 the price of pulp continues *-1 to soften, "We should do well.
Although bullish dollar sentiment has fizzled, many currency analysts say 0 a massive sell - off probably won't occur in the near future.
While Wall Street's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue *-1 to undermine the dollar, weakness in the pound and the yen is expected *-2 to offset those factors.
"By default," the dollar probably will be able *PRO*-1 to hold up pretty well in coming days, says 0 *T*-2 Francoise Soares - Kemp, a foreign - exchange adviser at Credit Suisse.
"We're close to the bottom" of the near - term ranges, she contends 0 *T*-1.
In late Friday afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen, off from late Thursday's 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen.
The pound strengthened to $1.5795 *U* from $1.5765 *U*.
In Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.70 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 142.75 yen.
The dollar began Friday on a firm note, *PRO*-2 gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen *-1 unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.
The rise came as traders continued *-1 to dump the pound after the sudden resignation Thursday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
But once the pound steadied with help from purchases by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the dollar was dragged *-2 down, traders say 0 *?*, by the stock - market slump that *T*-1 left the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a loss of 17.01 points.
With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged *-2 by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that *T*-1 has diminished the attractiveness of dollar - denominated investments, traders say 0 the dollar is still in a precarious position.
"They'll be looking at levels 0 *PRO* to sell the dollar *T*-2," says *T*-1 James Scalfaro, a foreign - exchange marketing representative at Bank of Montreal.
While some analysts say 0 the dollar eventually could test support at 1.75 marks and 135 yen, Mr. Scalfaro and others don't see the currency decisively sliding under support at 1.80 marks and 140 yen soon.
Predictions for limited dollar losses are based *-1 largely on the pound's weak state after Mr. Lawson's resignation and the yen's inability *PRO* to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats *T*-2.
With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies, "you don't have a confirmation" that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works, says 0 *T*-1 Mike Malpede, senior currency analyst at Refco Inc. in Chicago.
As far as the pound goes *?*, some traders say 0 a slide toward support at $1.5500 *U* may be a favorable development for the dollar this week.
While the pound has attempted *PRO*-1 to stabilize, currency analysts say 0 it is in critical condition.
Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week's low of $1.5765 *U* when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six - year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members *T*-1.
He was succeeded *-1 by John Major, who *T*-2 Friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high British interest rates that he said "*T*-3 are working exactly as intended" in *PRO*-4 reducing inflation.
But the market remains uneasy about Mr. Major's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound, currency analysts contend 0 *T*-1.
Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain's slowing economy is headed *-1 for a recession, it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness *PRO* to prop up the pound with interest - rate increases helped *PRO*-2 stem pound selling in recent weeks.
If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined *PRO*-1 to use interest - rate boosts *PRO*-2 to rescue the pound from another plunge, that currency is expected *-3 to fall sharply.
"It *EXP*-1's fair *PRO* to say 0 there are more risks for the pound *ICH*-4 under Major than there were *?* under Lawson," says *T*-3 Malcolm Roberts, a director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers in London.
"There's very little upside to sterling," Mr. Roberts says *T*-2, but he adds that near - term losses may be small because the selling wave that *T*-1 followed Mr. Major's appointment apparently has run its course.
But some other analysts have a stormier forecast for the pound, particularly because Britain's inflation is hovering at a relatively lofty annual rate of about 7.6% and the nation is burdened *-1 with a struggling government and large current account *RNR*-2 and trade *RNR*-2 deficits.
The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year, says 0 *T*-1 Nigel Rendell, an international economist at James Capel & Co. in London.
The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday, off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier.
If the pound falls closer to 2.80 marks, the Bank of England may raise Britain's base lending rate by one percentage point to 16%, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Rendell.
But such an increase, he says 0 *?*, could be viewed *-1 by the market as "too little too late."
The Bank of England indicated its desire *PRO* to leave its monetary policy *PRO*-5 unchanged Friday by *PRO*-4 declining *PRO*-3 to raise the official 15% discount - borrowing rate that it charges discount houses *T*-1, analysts say 0 *T*-2.
Pound concerns aside, the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another boon for the dollar, many traders say 0 *T*-1.
The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased *-1 heavily in recent weeks, says 0 *T*-2 Ms. Soares - Kemp of Credit Suisse.
The yen's softness, she says 0 *?*, apparently stems from Japanese investors' interest in *PRO* buying dollars against the yen *PRO*-2 to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year's upheaval in the Japanese government.
On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery jumped $5.80 *U*, to $378.30 *U* an ounce, the highest settlement since July 12.
Estimated volume was a heavy seven million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted *-1 at $378.87 *U* an ounce.
NBI Inc. said that it cannot pay the Oct. 31 dividend on its Series A convertible preferred stock, *PRO* allowing the stock's holder to convert the shares into as much as 27.7% of NBI's shares outstanding.
NBI said that it has the funds 0 *PRO* to pay the dividend *T*-1, but that it doesn't have the surplus or profit required * under Delaware law for payment of the dividend.
All the preferred stock is held *-1 by the Yukon Office Supply Stock Ownership Plan.
Under terms of the stock, the Yukon ESOP can demand that the stock be redeemed *-1 for $4,090,000 *U* on Nov. 30, but NBI said 0 it is legally prohibited *-2 from *PRO*-3 making the redemption.
Failure *PRO* to pay the dividend allows Yukon to convert all or some of its shares into NBI common after Nov. 30, at a conversion price based * on NBI's closing stock price.
NBI, a maker of word - processing systems, said 0 it can't predict if any of the preferred stock will be converted *-1.
NBI also said 0 it has hired Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. as its financial adviser and investment banker *PRO*-1 to help it restructure financially and improve its balance sheet.
Congress sent to President Bush an $8.5 billion *U* military construction bill that *T*-1 cuts spending for new installations by 16% while *PRO*-2 revamping the Pentagon budget *PRO*-3 to move more than $450 million *U* from foreign bases to home - state projects.
The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set * earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees, and--at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S.'s standing in the world economy--overseas spending is most vulnerable.
Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines, for example, are cut *-1 by almost two - thirds, while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home.
The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60 - 40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed *-41 by a ratio of approximately 70 - 30.
The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees; meanwhile, lawmakers used their positions *PRO*-2 to garner as much as six times what the Pentagon had requested *T*-1 for their individual states.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss .) helped *PRO*-1 secure $49.7 million *U* for his state, or more than double the Pentagon's budget.
West Virginia, home of Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, would receive $21.5 million *U*--four times the military's request.
Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million *U*, or 25% above the Pentagon's request.
Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less, their increases above Pentagon requests--640% and 430%, respectively--were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures.
The swift passage of the bill, which *T*-1 cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week, contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion *U* measure funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.
By an 84 - 6 margin, the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday, but the bill was then sent *-2 back to the House *PRO* to resolve the question of how *PRO* to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration *T*-1.
The House Democratic leadership could seek *PRO*-1 to waive these restrictions, but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere.
Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices *PRO*-1 to disguise as much as $1 billion *U* in spending, and as critics have awakened to these devices, the bill can seem like a wounded caribou trying *PRO* to make it past ice and wolves *PRO*-3 to reach safer winter grazing.
Much of the excess spending will be pushed *-3 into fiscal 1991, and in some cases is temporarily parked *-3 in slow - spending accounts in anticipation of *PRO* being transferred *-1 to faster - spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed *-2.
For example, a House - Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million *U*, or more than $200 million *U* above what either chamber had previously approved *T*-1.
Part of the increase would provide $90 million *U* toward *PRO* ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket - motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi.
But as much as $177 million *U*, or nearly 30% of the account, is marked *-1 for potential transfers to research, management and flight accounts that *T*-2 are spent *-3 out at a faster clip.
The bill's managers face criticism, too, for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed * on where funds will be spent *-1 *T*-2.
Conservatives, embarrassed * by Republican influence - peddling scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, have used the issue in an effort *PRO* to shift blame onto a Democratic - controlled Congress.
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp backed an unsuccessful effort *PRO* to strike such language last week, but received little support from the White House budget office, which *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to protect space - station funding in the bill and has tended *-2 to turn its eyes from pork - barrel amendments.
Within discretionary funds for community development grants, more than $3.7 million *U* is allocated *-1 to six projects in Michigan, home state of a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Bob Traxler.
House Speaker Thomas Foley won $510,000 *U* for a project in his district in Washington state, and $1.3 million *U*, earmarked * by Sen. Daniel Inouye, amounts to a business subsidy under the title "Hawaiian sugar mills job retention."
The powerful Democrat had first wanted *PRO*-2 to add language relaxing environmental restrictions on two mills on the Hamakua coast that *T*-1 are threatening *PRO*-3 to close.
When this plan met resistance *T*-3, it *EXP*-4 was agreed *-5 instead *PRO* to take money from HUD *PRO*-1 to subsidize needed improvements in two settling ponds for the mills, which *T*-2 employ an estimated 1,500 workers, according to Mr. Inouye's office.
October employment data--also could turn out *-1 to be the most confusing.
On the surface, the overall unemployment rate is expected *-1 to be little changed *-2 from September's 5.3%.
But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely *-3 to be muddied *-1 by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less - than - perfect seasonal adjustments, economists said 0 *T*-2.
The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September's 209,000 increase.
But the important factory - jobs segment, which *T*-2 last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears, is most likely *-3 to be skewed *-1 by the month's unusual events.
Several other reports *ICH*-1 come before Friday's jobs data, including: the September leading indicators index, new - home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain - store sales on Thursday.
Friday brings the final count on October auto sales.
"The employment report is going *-2 to be difficult 0 *PRO* to interpret *T*-3," said *T*-1 Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc., New York.
Mr. Englund added that next month's data isn't likely *-2 to be much better, because it will be distorted *-1 by San Francisco's earthquake.
What *T*-1's more, he believes 0 seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past, because of production and pricing differences that *T*-2 are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built * into the employment data.
Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched *-1 *PRO* to see if the index maintains a level below 50%, as it has *?* for the past couple of months.
A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy that *T*-1 is generally contracting while a reading above 50% indicates an economy that *T*-2's expanding.
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said that the purchasers' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month.
But he added: "Some people use the purchasers' index as a leading indicator, some use it as a coincident indicator.
But the thing 0 it's supposed *-2 to measure *T*-1--manufacturing strength--it missed *-3 altogether last month."
David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., Boston, said that the purchasers' index "does miss occasionally," *PRO*-1 adding: "When it misses one month *T*-2 it tends *-3 to miss the next month, too."
The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August.
Economists said 0 greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped *PRO*-1 lift the index.
All orders - related components, such as consumer - goods orders and building permits, are thought *-1 to have been weaker.
Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain - store sales.
Usually, October "isn't a very interesting month {for retail figures} because school clothes have been bought *-1 and people are waiting for December *PRO*-3 to buy Christmas presents," he said 0 *T*-2.
But Mr. Wyss said 0 he will watch the numbers *PRO*-1 to get an inkling of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto - buying apparently has *?*.
He noted that higher gasoline prices will help *PRO*-1 buoy the October totals.
Seasonal factors are also expected *-2 to have taken their toll on September new - home sales, which *T*-1 are believed *-3 to have fallen sharply from August's 755,000 units.
Construction spending is believed *-1 to have slipped about 0.5% from August levels, although economists noted 0 the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage.
In an age of specialization, the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist.
A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases, from arson to securities fraud, without *PRO*-1 missing a beat.
But even on the federal bench, specialization is creeping in, and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit was created *-1 in 1982 *PRO*-1 to serve, among other things, as the court of last resort for most patent disputes.
Previously, patent cases moved through the court system to one of the 12 circuit appeals courts.
There, judges who *T*-1 saw few such cases and *T*-1 had no experience in the field grappled with some of the most technical and complex disputes imaginable.
A new specialty court was sought *-1 by patent experts, who *T*-2 believed that the generalists had botched too many important, multimillion - dollar cases.
Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled *-1 with experts in the field.
But the Reagan administration thought otherwise, and so may *T*-1 the Bush administration.
Since 1984, the president has filled four vacancies in the Federal Circuit court with non-patent lawyers.
Now only three of the 12 judges--Pauline Newman, Chief Judge Howard T. Markey, 68, and Giles Rich, 85--have patent - law backgrounds.
The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman, 73, are approaching senior status or retirement.
Three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely *-3 to be filled *-1 within a few years, so patent lawyers and research - based industries are making a new push for specialists 0 *T*-4 to be added *-2 to the court.
Several organizations, including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, have asked the White House and Justice Department *PRO*-1 to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds.
The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training.
Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who *T*-1 now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia.
Dr. Lourie says 0 the Justice Department interviewed him last July.
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department.
"We do not feel that seats are reserved *-1 (for patent lawyers)," says *T*-4 Justice spokesman David Runkel, who *T*-3 declines *PRO*-5 to say how soon a candidate will be named *-2 *T*-6.
"But we will take it into consideration."
The Justice Department's view is shared *-1 by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, Judge H. Robert Mayer, a former civil litigator who *T*-3 served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed *-2 to the Federal Circuit two years ago.
"I believe that any good lawyer should be able *PRO*-4 to figure out *RNR*-5 and understand *RNR*-5 patent law," Judge Mayer says *?*, *PRO*-2 adding that "it *EXP*-3's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers (who *T*-1 argue before the court) *PRO* to make us understand (complex patent litigation)."
Yet some lawyers point to Eli Lilly & Co. vs. Medtronic, Inc., the patent infringement case 0 the Supreme Court this month agreed *PRO*-3 to review *T*-2, as an example of poor legal reasoning by judges who *T*-1 lack patent litigation experience.
(Judge Mayer was not on the three - member panel.)
In the Lilly case, the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer, an exemption 0 *PRO* to infringe a patent under certain circumstances *T*-1.
If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic's favor, the decision will have billion - dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products that *T*-1 required Food & Drug Administration approval.
Lisa Raines, a lawyer and director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnical Association, contends that a judge well - versed in patent law and the concerns of research - based industries would have ruled otherwise.
And Judge Newman, a former patent lawyer, wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a rehearing of the case by the full court *T*-1, "The panel's judicial legislation has affected an important high - technological industry, without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest."
Says *ICH*-1 Ms. Raines, "(The judgment) confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove *-2 troublesome.
American Pioneer Inc. said 0 it agreed in principle *PRO*-1 to sell its American Pioneer Life Insurance Co. subsidiary to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s HBJ Insurance Cos. for $27 million *U*.
American Pioneer, parent of American Pioneer Savings Bank, said 0 the sale will add capital and reduce the level of investments in subsidiaries for the thrift holding company.
Recently, the boards of both the parent company and the thrift also voted *PRO*-1 to suspend dividends on preferred shares of both companies and convert all preferred into common shares.
The company said 0 the move was necessary *PRO*-1 to meet capital requirements.
The transaction is subject to execution of a definitive purchase agreement and approval by various regulatory agencies, including the insurance departments of the states of Florida and Indiana, the company said 0 *T*-1.
In the second quarter, American Pioneer reported a loss of $7.3 million *U*, compared with net income of $1.1 million *U* a year earlier.
The banking operation had a loss of $8.7 million *U* in the second quarter, largely because of problem real - estate loans, while the insurance operations earned $884,000 *U*.
Italy's trade deficit narrowed to 2.007 trillion lire ($1.49 billion *U*) in September from 2.616 trillion lire a year earlier, the state statistical office Istat said 0 *T*-1.
The deficit was 466 billion lire in August.
For the first nine months, the trade deficit was 14.933 trillion lire, compared with 10.485 trillion lire in the year - earlier period.
Istat said 0 the statistics are provisional and aren't seasonally adjusted *-1.
Imports rose 11% to 18.443 trillion lire in September from a year earlier, while exports rose 17% to 16.436 trillion lire.
In the nine months, imports rose 20% to 155.039 trillion lire, while exports grew 18% to 140.106 trillion lire.
Import values are calculated *-1 on a cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f .) basis, while exports are accounted for *-2 on a free - on - board (f.o.b .) basis.
The fiscal 1989 budget deficit figure came out Friday.
It was down a little.
The next time 0 you hear a Member of Congress moan about the deficit *T*-2, *PRO* consider what Congress did *T*-1 Friday.
The Senate, 84 - 6, voted *PRO*-1 to increase to $124,000 *U* the ceiling on insured mortgages from the FHA, which *T*-7 lost $4.2 billion *U* in loan defaults last year.
Then, by voice vote, the Senate voted a pork - barrel bill, approved * Thursday by the House, for domestic military construction.
*PRO* Compare the Bush request to what the Senators gave themselves *T*-1:
For construction in West Virginia, Mr. Bush requested $4.5 million *U*; Congress gave Senator Byrd's state $21.5 million *U*.
Senator Byrd is chairman of the Appropriations Committee.
For Iowa, a $1.8 million *U* request became $12 million *U* for Senator Grassley, ranking minority member of a military construction subcommittee.
Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi and chairman of House Appropriations turned a $20 million *U* Bush request for his state into a $49.7 million *U* bequest.
Senator Sasser of Tennessee is chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on military construction; Mr. Bush's $87 million *U* request for Tennessee increased to $109 million *U*.
In a remark 0 someone should remember *T*-1 this time next year, Senator Sasser said, "I think 0 we've seen the peak of military construction spending for many years 0 *T*-2 to come."
*PRO* Tell us about spending restraint.
*PRO* Tell us about the HUD scandals.
*PRO* Tell us what measure, *PRO*-2 short of house arrest, *T*-1 will get this Congress under control.
Kerr - McGee Corp. said 0 it will spend $42 million *U* *PRO*-1 to purchase land and relocate its ammonium perchlorate storage facility to Clark County, Nev., from Henderson, Nev.
The company said 0 it will move the storage and cross-blending operations to a site 23 miles northeast of Las Vegas *PRO*-1 to distance the operations from residential areas.
Ammonium perchlorate is an oxidizer that *T*-2 is mixed *-1 with a propellant *PRO* to make rocket fuel used * in the space shuttle and military rockets.
In May 1988, an ammonium perchlorate plant in Henderson owned * by an American Pacific Corp. unit was leveled *-1 by a series of explosions.
After the explosion, Kerr - McGee temporarily shut down its facility just south of Las Vegas for a safety inspection.
American Pacific and Kerr - McGee are the only two U.S. manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate.
When the plant was destroyed *-1 *T*-2, "I think everyone got concerned that the same thing would happen at our plant," a KerrMcGee spokeswoman said 0 *T*-3.
That prompted Kerr - McGee to consider *PRO*-1 moving the potentially volatile storage facilities and cross-blending operations away from town.
Kerr - McGee said 0 it has purchased 3,350 acres from the federal government in Clark County and plans *PRO*-1 to begin construction early next year.
The new facility is expected *-1 to begin operations in early 1991.
The Henderson plant will continue its other chemical operations, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Ciba - Geigy AG, the big Swiss chemicals company, said that it agreed in a letter of intent with Corning Inc. *PRO*-1 to acquire Corning's 50% share of Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp., based * in Medfield, Mass.
Ciba Corning, which *T*-51 had been a 50 - 50 venture between Basel - based Ciba - Geigy and Corning, has annual sales of about $300 million *U*, the announcement said 0 *T*-1.
Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed *-1.
Ciba Corning makes clinical diagnostics systems and related products for the medical - care industry.
The announcement said 0 the acquisition should be completed *-1 by December after a definitive agreement is completed *-2 and regulatory approval is received *-3.
Ciba - Geigy intends *PRO*-1 to develop the Ciba Corning unit into a "substantial business," *PRO*-2 making the unit an "integral part" of Ciba - Geigy's "comprehensive disease management concept.
These are the last words 0 Abbie Hoffman ever uttered *T*-1, more or less, before he killed himself.
And You Are There, sort of:
ABBIE: "I'm OK, Jack.
I'm OK."
(*PRO* listening) "Yeah.
I'm out of bed.
I got my feet on the floor.
Yeah.
Two feet.
I'll see you Wednesday?...Thursday."
He listens impassively.
ABBIE (*PRO* cont'd. *-1): "I'll always be with you, Jack.
*PRO* Don't worry."
Abbie lies back and leaves the frame *PRO*-1 empty.
Of course that wasn't the actual conversation 0 the late anti-war activist, protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had *T*-1 with his brother.
It's a script pieced * together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression.
The segment is *-2 soon to be broadcast *-3 on the CBS News series "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," thus *PRO* further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news.
It is the New Journalism come to television.
Ms. Chung's program is just one of several network shows (and many more in syndication) that *T*-1 rely on the controversial technique of *PRO* reconstructing events, using actors who *T*-2 are supposed *-3 to resemble real people, living and dead.
Ms. Chung's, however, is said *-1 to be the only network news program in history 0 *T*-2 to employ casting directors.
Abbie Hoffman in this case is *-3 to be played *-1 by Hollywood actor Paul Lieber, who *T*-2 isn't new to the character.
He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called * *PRO*-1 "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial."
Television news, of course, has always been part show - biz.
Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role 0 entertainment values play *T*-1 in *PRO* captivating an audience.
But, as CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer puts it, the network now needs *-1 to "broaden the horizons of nonfiction television, and that includes some experimentation."
Since its premiere Sept. 16, the show on which Ms. Chung appears *T*-1 has used an actor *PRO*-2 to portray the Rev. Vernon Johns, a civil - rights leader, and one *PRO*-4 to play a teenage drug dealer.
It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
On Oct. 21, it did a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson, who *T*-2 was abducted *-3 in March 1985 and is believed *-3 to be held *-1 in Lebanon.
The production had actors playing Mr. Anderson and former hostages David Jacobsen, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco.
ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry.
"Prime Time Live," a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, has a studio audience that *T*-1 applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) *T*-2 waved at the camera like the crowd on "*PRO* Let's Make a Deal."
(ABC stops short of *PRO*-2 using an "applause" sign and a comic *PRO* to warm up the audience.
The stars do that themselves.)
NBC News has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced * by Sid Feders called * *PRO*-2 "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," starring Maria Shriver, Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams, that *T*-1 also gives work to actors.
*PRO* Call it *PRO*-1 a fad.
Or *PRO* call it *PRO*-1 the wave of the future.
NBC's re-creations are produced *-1 by Cosgrove - Meurer Productions, which *T*-2 also makes the successful prime - time NBC Entertainment series "Unsolved Mysteries."
The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated *-1 nonetheless.
News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost - conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive *PRO* to produce *?* than an entertainment show is *?*--somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 *U* for a one - hour program.
Entertainment shows tend *-1 to cost twice that.
Re-enactments have been used *-1 successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV" shows as "A Current Affair," which *T*-3 is produced *-2 by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
That show, whose host *T*-1 is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having * to do with sex--the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have *T*-2 you.
Gerald Stone, the executive producer of "A Current Affair," says, "We have opened eyes to *PRO* being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how *PRO* to present the news *T*-1."
Nowhere have eyes been opened *-1 wider than at CBS News.
At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan, one floor below the offices of "60 Minutes," the most successful prime - time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area *PRO*-1 to audition for "Saturday Night With Connie Chung."
CBS News sends scripts to agents, who *T*-1 pass them along to clients.
The network deals a lot with unknowns, including Scott Wentworth, who *T*-1 portrayed Mr. Anderson, and Bill Alton as Father Jenco, but the network has some big names 0 *PRO* to contend with *T*-2, too.
James Earl Jones is cast *-1 *PRO*-2 to play the Rev. Mr. Johns.
Ned Beatty may portray former California Gov. Pat Brown in a forthcoming epsiode on Caryl Chessman, the last man 0 *T*-2 to be executed *-1 in California, in 1960.
"Saturday Night" has cast actors *PRO*-2 to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen - agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named * *PRO*-4 Willie Bosket, who *T*-1 calls himself *PRO*-5 a "monster" and is reputed *-3 to be the toughest prisoner in New York.
CBS News, which as recently as two years ago *T*-1 fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks, now hires featured actors beginning at $2,700 *U* a week.
That isn't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes *T*-4, or even Connie Chung for that matter (who *T*-2 is paid *-1 $1.6 million *U* a year and who *T*-3 recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom "Murphy Brown").
But the money isn't peanuts either, particularly for a news program.
CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown, Pa., with something less than a cast of thousands.
It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras.
On Oct. 20, the town's mayor, Robert Reid, made an announcement on behalf of CBS during half - time at the Middletown High School football game *PRO*-1 asking for volunteers.
"There was a roll of laughter through the stands," says *T*-1 Joe Sukle, the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in Middletown.
"They're filming right now at the bank down the street, and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards.
They are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want *PRO*-1 to be in a docudrama."
Mr. Sukle says 0 he wouldn't dream of *PRO*-1 participating himself:
"No way.
I think 0 re-enactments stink."
Though a re-enactment may have the flavor, Hollywood on the Hudson it isn't *-1.
Some producers seem *-1 tentative about the technique, squeamish even.
So the results, while not news, aren't exactly theater either, at least not good theater.
And some people do think that *PRO* acting out scripts isn't worthy of CBS News, which *T*-1 once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry.
In his review of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Tom Shales, the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of CBS, wrote that while the show is "impressive,...one has *-1 to wonder if this is the proper direction 0 for a network news division to take *T*-2."
*PRO* Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank, former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Joan Konner.
Says *ICH*-1 she: "Once you add dramatizations, it's no longer news, it's drama, and that has no place on a network news broadcast....
They should never be on.
Never."
Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who *T*-1 knew and loved the man.
That includes his companion of 15 years, Johanna Lawrenson, as well as his former wife, Anita.
Both women say 0 they also find it *EXP*-1 distasteful that CBS News is apparently concentrating on Mr. Hoffman's problems as a manic - depressive.
"This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie's life," says *T*-2 Ms. Lawrenson, who *T*-1 has had an advance look at the 36 - page script.
"It's a sensational piece about someone who *T*-1 is not here *PRO*-2 to defend himself."
Mrs. Hoffman says that dramatization "makes the truth flexible.
It takes one person's account and gives it authenticity."
CBS News interviewed Jack Hoffman and his sister, Phyllis, as well as Mr. Hoffman's landlord in Solebury Township, Pa.
Also Jonathan Silvers, who *T*-1 collaborated with Mr. Hoffman on two books.
Mr. Silvers says, "I wanted *PRO*-2 to be interviewed *-1 *PRO*-2 to get Abbie's story out, and maybe *PRO* talking about the illness will do some good."
The executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Andrew Lack, declines *PRO*-1 to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular.
"I don't talk about my work," he says *T*-1.
The president of CBS News, David W. Burke, didn't return numerous telephone calls.
One person close to the process says 0 it *EXP*-1 would not be in the best interest of CBS News *PRO* to comment on a "work in progress," such as the Hoffman re-creation, but says 0 CBS News is "aware" of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman's former wife.
Neither woman was invited *-1 by CBS News *PRO*-3 to participate in a round - table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that *T*-2 is *-4 to follow the re-enactment.
Mr. Lieber, the actor who *T*-2 plays Mr. Hoffman, says 0 he was concerned *ICH*-4 at first that the script would "misrepresent an astute political mind, one that I admired *T*-3," but that his concerns were allayed *-1.
The producers, he says 0 *?*, did a good job of *PRO* depicting someone "who *T*-1 had done so much, but who *T*-2 was also a manic - depressive.
*PRO* Wanted *-2: An investment that *T*-1's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth *PRO* getting excited about *?*.
With $150 billion *U* of CDs maturing this month, a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment.
In April, when many of them bought their CDs *T*-1, six - month certificates were yielding more than 9%; investors willing *PRO* to look could find double - digit yields at some banks and thrifts.
Now, the nationwide average yield on a six - month CD is just under 8%, and 8.5% is about the best around.
But investors looking for alternatives aren't finding it easy.
Yields on most fixed - income securities are lower than several months ago.
And the stock market's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there.
"If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD, you're not going *-2 to find it," says *T*-1 Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz.
There are, however, some alternatives that income - oriented investors should consider *T*-1, investment advisers say 0 *T*-2.
Short - term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax - deferred annuities are some of the choices 0 they mention *T*-1--and not just as a way 0 *PRO* to get a higher return *T*-2.
In particular, advisers say 0 *?*, investors may want *PRO*-3 to look at securities that *T*-1 reduce the risk that CD holders are confronting *T*-5 right now, of *PRO* having *-4 to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short - term certificates at lower rates.
A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense.
"People should remember 0 their money isn't all or nothing--they don't need *-1 to be shopping for the one interest - rate - type investment and putting all their money in it," says *T*-2 Bethesda, Md., adviser Karen Schaeffer.
Here's *T*-1 a look at some of the alternatives:
SHORT - TERM MUNICIPALS:
Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators.
Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after - tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years.
That's because municipal - bond interest is exempt from federal income tax--and from state and local taxes too, for in - state investors.
For an investor paying tax at a 33% rate, a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one - year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%.
Rates *ICH*-1 approach 6.5% on five - year municipals.
Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.
These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that *T*-2 will be sold *-4 *PRO* to pay off holders when the municipals are retired *-1 *T*-3.
"It's a no - brainer: You don't have *-2 to worry about diversification; you don't have *-3 to worry about quality," says *T*-1 Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc.
*PRO* Consider a "laddered" bond portfolio, with issues maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994, advises 0 *T*-1 Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly, R.I., financial planner.
The idea is *PRO* to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates.
BOND FUNDS:
Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy 0 *PRO* to buy and sell *T*-1.
That makes them a reasonable option for investors who *T*-1 will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order *PRO*-2 to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so.
Buyers can look forward to double - digit annual returns if they are right.
But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead.
Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.
The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens.
*PRO* Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that *T*-1 were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.
The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one - year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount.
But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2 - year average maturity.
"You get equity - like returns" from bonds if you guess right on rates, says 0 *T*-1 James E. Wilson, a Columbia, S.C., planner.
If interest rates don't change, bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields.
DEFERRED ANNUITIES:
These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded *-1 without tax consequences until money is withdrawn *-2, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed *-3 on withdrawals made * before age 59 1/2.
Aimed *-2 specifically at CD holders are *T*-1 so - called CD - type annuities, or certificates of annuity.
An interest rate is guaranteed *-1 for between one and seven years, after which holders get 30 days 0 *PRO* to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer's contract without the surrender charges that *T*-2 are common to annuities *T*-3 *T*-4.
Some current rates exceed those on CDs.
For instance, a CD - type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance, Chicago, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years.
Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions.
But at age 55, "they may be a great deal," says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Wilson, the Columbia, S.C., planner.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS:
That's right, money market mutual funds.
The conventional wisdom is *PRO* to go into money funds when rates are rising *T*-1 and shift out at times such as the present, when rates seem headed *-3 down *T*-2.
With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that *T*-1 track market interest rates, with a slight lag.
Still, today's highest - yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall, says 0 *T*-1 Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta.
That's because top - yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield.
Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a seven - day compound yield just under 9.5%.
*PRO*-1 A new fund, its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized *-1 by the sponsor.
*PRO* Try combining a money fund and an intermediate - term bond fund as a low - risk bet on falling rates, suggests 0 *T*-1 Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co.
If rates unexpectedly rise, the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower - than - *PRO* expected *-1 return from the bond fund.
Dennis Farney's Oct. 13 page - one article "River of Despair," about the poverty along the Mississippi, fanned childhood memories of when my parents were sharecroppers in southeastern Arkansas, only a few miles from the river *T*-1.
Although we were white, the same economic factors *ICH*-1 affected us as *PRO* affects the black people 0 Mr. Farney writes about *T*-2.
Fortunately, an aunt with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us 50 miles north to good schools and an environment that *T*-1 opened the world of opportunity for me as an eight - year - old.
Though I've been blessed *-1 with academic degrees and some success in the materialistic world, I've never forgotten *RNR*-2 or lost contact with *RNR*-2 those memories of the 1930s.
Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned *-1 by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.
These are the families who *T*-1 used *RNR*-3--and sometime abused *RNR*-3--their sharecroppers, people who *T*-2 had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life.
Following World War II, when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families *T*-2, the surplus people were dumped *-1 into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare.
And today, many of their children, grandchildren and great - grandchildren remain on welfare.
In the meantime, the landowners continue receiving generous subsidies that *T*-1 began during New Deal days.
Or those who *T*-1 choose not *PRO*-2 to farm can lease their lands and crop allotments for handsome sums.
Farmers in the Midwest and other areas have suffered, but those along the Mississippi continue *-3 to prosper with holdings that *T*-2 were built *-1 with the sweat of men and women living in economic slavery.
And when they were no longer needed *-4 *T*-2, they were turned *-1 *PRO*-5 loose *PRO*-1 unprepared *PRO*-3 to build lives of their own.

Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations, *PRO* breaking this cycle will be next to impossible.
Sadly, the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral.
Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found *-1 in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves.
The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory 0 *T*-1 to open, river traffic 0 *T*-2 to increase, government spending 0 *T*-3 to fund job - training programs or public schools 0 *T*-4 to educate apathetic students.
Because we refuse *PRO*-1 to face the tough answers, the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees, for the media and politicians.
Coffee - shop chatter does not lend itself to *PRO* solving the problems of racism, teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance.
Does the Delta deserve government help in *PRO*-2 attracting industry when the majority of residents, black and white, do not realize 0 racism alienates potential employers *T*-1?
Should we focus on the region's infant - mortality rate when the vocal right - wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from *PRO*-1 teaching the two ways (abstinence or contraceptives) of *PRO* decreasing teen pregnancy *T*-2?
Delta problems are difficult, not impossible, 0 *PRO* to solve *T*-1--I am just not convinced *-2 that we are ready *PRO*-3 to solve them yet.

Your story is an insult to the citizens of the Mississippi Delta.
Many of the problems 0 you presented *T*-1 exist in every part of this country.
Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush's residence.
For years, we tried *PRO*-1 to ignore the problem of poverty, and now that it has gotten out of hand it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress.
Nobody should have *-1 to live in such poor conditions as in "Sugar Ditch," but when you travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York *T*-2, the same problems exist.
The only difference is, 0 in those cities the poor are housed *-1 in high - rise - project apartments each consisting of one room, with rusty pipes called *PRO* *PRO*-2 plumbing, rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators--and with the building patrolled * by gangs and drug dealers.
Many middle - class people would love free food, Medicaid insurance, utilities and rent.
Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children and watch Oprah Winfrey, like Beulah in the article, instead of *PRO*-2 having one child and working constantly *PRO*-1 just to stay above water, like so many families in this country.

Exxon Corp. is resigning from the National Wildlife Federation's corporate advisory panel, *PRO*-1 saying 0 the conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez oil spill along the Alaskan coast.
The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation, but issued a stinging response that *T*-1 called Exxon *PRO*-3 a "corporate pariah" that *T*-2 should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists.
The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been one of the sharpest critics of Exxon's handling of the 11 million gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of *PRO*-1 repeatedly ignoring requests *PRO* to meet and discuss it.
The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline along Alaska's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and the fishing industry.
Exxon's Exxon USA unit was one of the charter members of the Corporate Conservation Council, a panel of executives formed * in 1982 by the National Wildlife Federation *PRO*-1 to foster "frank and open discussions" between industry and the federation's leaders.
In a letter to the federation, Raymond Campion, Exxon's environmental coordinator, said: "Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill have failed *-1 to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness."
The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed * in August against Exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery costs from the spill.

First Tennessee National Corp. said 0 it would take a $4 million *U* charge in the fourth quarter, as a result of plans *PRO* to expand its systems operation.
The banking company said 0 it reached an agreement in principle with International Business Machines Corp. on a systems operations contract calling for IBM to operate First Tennessee's computer and telecommunications functions.
Further, under the agreement, First Tennesse would continue *-2 to develop the software that *T*-1 creates customer products and sevices.
"Because personal computers will soon be on the desks of all of our tellers, and customer service and loan representatives, information will be instantly available *PRO*-1 to help customers with product decisions and provide them with information about their accounts," according to John Kelley, executive vice president *RNR*-2 and corporate services group manager *RNR*-2 at First Tennessee.
However, about 120 employees will be affected *-1 by the agreement.
First Tennessee, *PRO*-1 assisted *-2 by IBM, said 0 it will attempt *PRO*-3 to place the employees within the company, IBM or other companies in Memphis.
The process will take as many as six months *PRO* to complete, the company said 0 *T*-1.
The agreement is subject to the banking company's board approval, which *T*-2 is expected *-1 next month.
In Bombay stock market circles, the buzzword is "mega."
At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market *PRO*-1 to raise $6 billion *U*, an amount never thought *PRO* possible in India.
"When they talk mega-issues *T*-1, they're truly talking mega," says *T*-2 S.A. Dave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
"The capital market is booming."
But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market.
One is whether there is enough money *PRO* to fund the new issues without *PRO*-1 depressing stock trading.
Moreover, in the relatively unregulated Indian stock markets, investors frequently don't know what they are getting *T*-1 when they subscribe to an issue *T*-2.
A prospectus in India doesn't always tell a potential investor much.
Some of the large amounts are being raised *-1 by small firms.
In addition, once money is raised *-1, investors usually have no way of *PRO* knowing how it is spent *-2 *T*-3.
Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash.
"The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects," says *T*-1 G.S. Patel, a former chairman of the giant, government - run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of India.
"They're going *-1 to have mega-problems."
The Indian stock markets have been on a five - year high, with dips and corrections, since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi started *-1 liberalizing industry.
But the last stock market boom, in 1986, seems *-1 small compared with the current rush to market.
The $6 billion *U* that some 40 companies are looking *PRO*-1 to raise *T*-2 in the year ending March 31 compares with only $2.7 billion *U* raised * on the capital market in the previous fiscal year.
In fiscal 1984, before Mr. Gandhi came to power, only $810 million *U* was raised *-1.
This year's biggest issue, $570 million *U* of convertible debentures by engineering company Larsen & Toubro Ltd., is the largest in Indian history.
And it isn't the only giant issue: together, the top four issues will raise $1.3 billion *U*.
Convertible debentures--bonds that *T*-2 can later be converted *-1 into equity shares--are the most popular instrument this year, though many companies are also selling nonconvertible bonds or equity shares.
These mega-issues are being propelled *-1 by two factors, economic and political.
In the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochemical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns *PRO* to conserve resources and restrict the profits 0 businessmen could make *T*-1.
As a result, industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient industrial units.
When Mr. Gandhi came to power *T*-1, he ushered in new rules for business.
He said 0 industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale.
If the output was too great for the domestic market, he said 0 *?*, companies should export.
India's overregulated businessmen had *-2 to be persuaded *-1, but they have started *-3 to think big.
Some of the projects being funded * by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy, and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built * in the past.
The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market, which *T*-1 is a far cheaper source of funds than government - controlled banks, where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16% *T*-2.
The second factor spurring mega-issues is political.
Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose.
Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive.
The buoyant Bombay rumor mill also says that some of the money raised * in the current spate of issues will be used *-1 as campaign donations before the elections.
No one admits to anything, but India's industrialists have a history of *PRO* making under - the - table campaign donations.
So far, the mega-issues are a hit with investors.
Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co.'s offer of $355 million *U* of convertible debentures was oversubscribed *-1.
Essar Gujarat Ltd., a marine construction company, had similar success with a slightly smaller issue.
Larsen & Toubro started *-2 accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed *-3.
*PRO*-2 Still to come are *T*-1 big issues by Bindal Agro Chem Ltd., a petrochemical and agrochemical company, and Usha Rectifier Corp . (India), a semiconductor maker.
While many investors are selling parts of their portfolios *PRO*-1 to buy the new issues, prices on India's 16 stock exchanges are holding up so far.
"I don't think 0 it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market," says *?* Mr. Patel, "only a sagging tendency."
Says 0 *T*-2 M.J. Pherwani, chairman of the Unit Trust of India: The "markets are headed *-1 for growth unheard of and unseen before."
But with growth come growing pains, and never has this been clearer *ICH*-1 on the Indian capital market than now.
In the past, the government controlled the markets indirectly, through its tight grip on industry itself.
Various ministries decided the products 0 businessmen could produce *T*-2 and how much *?* *T*-1; and government - owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans.
The government has been content with this far - reaching, subtle form of control, exercised * on a case - by - case basis with no clear rules or guidelines.
But now, with large amounts being raised *-1 from investors, the government's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation *PRO*-1 to make it operational.
Mr. Dave, its head, acts cheery and patient, but he makes no bones about the need *PRO* to get to work.
"Mega or non-mega, we feel 0 the prospectus standards *T*-4 need *-3 to be considerably improved *-2," he says *T*-1.
"Disclosures are very poor in India."
He says 0 the big questions--"Do you really need this much money *PRO*-2 to put up these investments? Have you told investors what *T*-1 is happening in your sector? What about your track record?--"aren't asked *-3 of companies coming to market.
Instead, he says 0 *?*, most investors have *-1 to rely on the rumor - happy Indian press.
An example is the biggest offering of them all, Larsen & Toubro's $570 million *U* bond issue.
The engineering company was acquired *-1 in a takeover earlier this year by the giant Reliance textile group.
Although Larsen & Toubro hadn't raised money from the public in 38 years, its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market.
(Reliance floated a $357 million *U* petrochemical company *ICH*-3 in 1988 that *T*-2 was, at the time, the largest public issue in Indian history.)
The media has raised questions about Larsen & Toubro's issue, *PRO*-1 pointing out that it exceeds the company's annual sales and its market capitalization.
Even stranger is *T*-2 the case of Usha Rectifier, a semiconductor company with 1988 sales of $28 million *U* that *T*-1's raising $270 million *U* *PRO*-3 to build an iron plant.
Once the money is raised *-1, it *ICH*-4 isn't always certain how it is used *-2 *T*-3.
Larsen & Toubro, for example, says it's raising $570 million *U* 0 *PRO* to use *T*-1 as supplier credit on large engineering jobs.
Unlike other companies, it hasn't pin - pointed specific projects for the funds.
And even when specific projects are described *-1 in prospectuses *T*-3, the money often is used *-2 elsewhere, according to analysts.
"Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed *-1 *T*-3," says *T*-2 Mr. Dave.
Mr. Patel agrees: "There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds.
They're trying *PRO*-1 to plug the various loopholes, but they're totally unprepared for this."
Because of the large amounts of money being raised *, the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used *-1 *T*-4, some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes, which *T*-2 could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that *T*-3 followed the boom of 1986.
The government insists that such a possibility is low.
It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself, its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes.

The stock market correction of Oct. 13, 1989, was a grim reminder of the Oct. 19, 1987 market collapse.
Since, like earthquakes, stock market disturbances will always be with us, it *EXP*-1 is prudent *PRO* to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse.
In general, markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances.
But there are times when they seize up, and panicky sellers cannot find buyers *T*-1.
That's just what *T*-1 happened in the October 1987 crash.
As the market tumbled, disorderly market conditions prevailed: The margins between buying bids and selling bids widened; *PRO* trading in many stocks was suspended *-2; orders took unduly long *PRO*-4 to be executed *-1; and many specialists stopped *-3 trading altogether.
These failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages: Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and margin - calls triggered additional selling pressures.
The situation was like that of a skier who *T*-2 is thrown *-1 slightly off balance by an unexpected bump on the slope.
His skis spread farther and farther apart--just as *PRO* buy - sell spreads widen during a financial panic--and soon he is out of control.
*PRO*-1 Unable *PRO*-2 to stop his accelerating descent, he crashes.
After the 1987 crash, and as a result of the recommendations of many studies, "circuit breakers" were devised *-1 *PRO* to allow market participants to regroup and restore orderly market conditions.
It *EXP*-2's doubtful, though, whether circuit breakers do any real good.
In the additional time 0 they provide *T*-1 even more order imbalances might pile up, as *PRO* would - be sellers finally get their broker on the phone.
Instead, an appropriate institution *ICH*-3 should be charged *-4 with the job of *PRO* preventing chaos in the market: the Federal Reserve.
The availability of timely assistance--of a backstop--can help markets retain their resilience.
The Fed already buys and sells foreign exchange *PRO*-1 to prevent disorderly conditions in foreign - exchange markets.
The Fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities.
The stock market is the only major market without a market - maker of unchallenged liquidity or a buyer of last resort.
This does not mean that the Federal Reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market.
In 1987, it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window.
It lent money to banks and encouraged them *PRO*-1 to make funds available to brokerage houses.
They, in turn, lent money to their customers--who *T*-1 were supposed *-2 to recognize the opportunity 0 *T*-3 to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares.
The Fed also has the power 0 *T*-1 to set margin requirements.
But wouldn't it *EXP*-4 be more efficient and effective *PRO* to supply such support to the stock market directly?
Instead of *PRO* flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by *PRO*-1 buying market averages in the futures market, thus *PRO*-1 stabilizing the market as a whole.
The stock market is certainly not too big for the Fed to handle.
The foreign - exchange and government securities markets are vastly larger.
Daily trading volume in the New York foreign exchange market is $130 billion *U*.
The daily volume for Treasury Securities is about $110 billion *U*.
The combined value of daily equity trading on the New York Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ over - the - counter market ranges between $7 billion *U* and $10 billion *U*.
The $13 billion *U* 0 the Fed injected *T*-1 into the money markets after the 1987 crash is more than enough *PRO* to buy all the stocks traded * on a typical day.
More carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action.
And *PRO* taking more direct action has the advantage of *PRO* avoiding sharp increases in the money supply, such as *PRO* happened in October 1987.
The Fed's stock market role ought *PRO*-1 not to be very ambitious.
It should seek only *PRO*-1 to maintain the functioning of markets--not *PRO*-1 to prop up the Dow Jones or New York Stock Exchange averages at a particular level.
The Fed should guard against systemic risk, but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks.
It *EXP*-5 would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell IBM or General Motors shares.
Instead, the Fed could buy the broad market composites in the futures market.
The increased demand would normalize trading and stabilize prices.
*PRO* Stabilizing the derivative markets would tend *PRO*-1 to stabilize the primary market.
The Fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO*-2 to treat the symptom--the liquidity of the banks.
Disorderly market conditions could be observed *-1 quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s.
But since the member countries of the International Monetary Fund agreed to the "Guidelines to Floating" in 1974, such difficulties have been avoided *-1.
I cannot recall any disorder in currency markets since the 1974 guidelines were adopted *-1.
Thus, the mere existence of a market - stabilizing agency helps *PRO* to avoid panic in emergencies.
The old saying advises: "If it ain't broke, *PRO* don't fix it."
But this could be a case where we all might go broke if it isn't fixed *-2 *T*-1.

The surprise resignations of two top economic government officials heaped more uncertainty on London's financial markets, which *T*-1 already have been laboring under worries about Britain's ailing economy.
"The last thing 0 markets like *T*-2 is uncertainty," said *T*-3 *ICH*-1 Ian Harwood, chief economist at S.G. Warburg & Co., of the resignations of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and chief economic adviser Sir Alan Walters.
"I think 0 you'll see share prices go down, and sterling now is under something of a cloud."
The pound immediately began *-2 to take a buffetting after the resignations were announced *-1.
In late New York trading, sterling stood at $1.5765 *U*, down from $1.6145 *U* late Wednesday.
The British economy is hardly the picture of health these days.
*PRO*-1 At 15%, base interest rates are the highest in eight years, and the 7.6% annual inflation rate is by far the highest in the European Community.
Unions are pressing demands for wage increases of more than 10% despite general belief that economic growth next year will be less than 2%.
Increasingly, the financial markets are reflecting the gloom.
The Financial Times 100 - share index has dropped about 12% from its 1989 high of 2423.9 on Sept. 8.
Yesterday, even before the resignations were announced *-1, the index dove 32.5 points *PRO*-2 to close at 2129.4.
"We are expecting a recession," says *T*-1 Donald Franklin, chief economist at Schroders investment bank.
"The only question is, how deep is it going *-2 to be *T*-1?
The outlook for corporate earnings is fairly bleak.
It *EXP*-1's quite likely 0 we're going *-2 to get repeats" of the mid-October market shocks.
Red ink already has begun *-1 to flow in the wake of the U.S. - U.K. market breaks of Oct. 13 and Oct. 16.
London - based LIT Holdings, the largest financer of traders in the Chicago options and futures markets, said yesterday 0 it will incur a second - half loss as a result of the market plunge.
The company, which also *T*-1 will omit its second - half dividend, didn't specify the size.
But company insiders estimated that the loss could approach the equivalent of $10 million *U*.
Christopher Castleman, LIT chief executive, said in an interview that the loss stemmed from the default of three options traders who *T*-1 had bet on a price rise in UAL Corp. shares before Oct. 13.
The price plummeted after a proposed leveraged buy - out of the airline fell through.
LIT Holdings shares plummeted 36 pence *PRO*-1 to close at 54 pence (85 cents), a 40% drop, on London's stock exchange.
Denizens of London's financial district are cushioning themselves for heavy blows.
"A lot more of our customers are staying until our 10 p.m. closing time," says *T*-2 Christopher Brown, managing director of Corney & Barrow Restaurants Ltd., which *T*-1 runs five tony wine bars in the district.
"There's a strong sense *ICH*-2 among the martini set that there's more {bad news} 0 *T*-3 to come," asserts *T*-1 Roger Yates, chief investment officer at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management.
"People in the stock market were very much Thatcher's children--very young and wealthy optimists.
Now it's dawning on them that they can be non-wealthy."
The malaise has created a nostalgic longing for the uncomplicated days of the mid-1980s, before a rash of securities - firm mergers on the eve of the industry's deregulation in 1986.
"People come to us *PRO*-1 saying 0 they'd like *PRO*-2 to be back where they were *T*-3 a few years ago, in a more collegial atmosphere, with less tension," says *T*-4 Stephen Waterhouse, managing director of Hanover Partners Ltd., a financial district head - hunting firm.
But after trading losses in the mid-October market jolts here, many people will be lucky *PRO*-1 to have jobs at all, executives predict 0 *T*-2.
The industry, which *T*-1 currently employs about 25,000 people in London, has shed about 2,500 jobs over the past two years.
"I can see cuts of at least 20% more," says *T*-1 the head of the London office of a major U.S. firm.
The mergers and acquisitions market has been a saving grace for the industry, but uncertainties are beginning *-1 to mount even there.
Intra-European takeovers are expected *-1 to continue at their brisk pace.
But investment bankers say that stock market uncertainties in the U.S. may cause many European companies to mark time before *PRO*-1 bidding for American companies, in the hope that share prices will come down.
"If prices in the States go down, industrial buyers in Europe have the opportunity of *PRO*-1 getting reasonable prices in the U.S.," says *T*-2 Francois von Hurter, chief of Continential M&A at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.
But he adds: "Everybody and his sister have opened up M&A shops.
It *EXP*-1's difficult *PRO* to see that there's going *-2 to be enough business 0 *T*-3 to go around.
About eight firms will get the lion's share.
At the others, there are going *-3 to be a lot of disappointments, after all those promises and all that big money that *T*-2's been paid *-1 to people."
It all adds up to a cold winter here.
Says *ICH*-1 Allen D. Wheat, head of trading at Bankers Trust Co.: "People are just plain scared."
One person who *T*-1 is past *PRO*-2 worrying about London's blues is Christopher Hartley.
Last summer, he chucked his 10 - year career as a London stockbroker and headed for the mountains.
He didn't stop until he got to Jackson Hole, Wyo.
"I'm glad *PRO*-1 to be out," said *T*-2 the 32 - year - old Mr. Hartley in a phone interview.
"The percentage of your day spent *PRO* twiddling your thumbs got greater, and the work day kept *PRO*-1 getting longer.
What am I doing *T*-1 in Jackson Hole?
Not a great deal.
My wife and I will stay through the skiing season, or until the money runs out--whichever *T*-1 comes first.
But unlike London, out here I've never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger.
Finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of Waertsilae Marine Oy, a major shipyard that *T*-2 filed for bankruptcy protection this week, amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation's entire shipbuilding industry can be averted *-1.
At stake are *T*-2 almost 10,000 jobs in an industry that *T*-1 has been the mainstay of Finland's post-war economic revival.
Shipbuilding became a point of pride as Finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals *ICH*-1 collapsed all over Europe.
But if, as many now fear, Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out *-1 to be remembered *-2 most as a blemish on Finland's international reputation.
The shipyard's 6.5 billion Finnish markka ($1.54 billion *U*) backlog includes about 20 ships ordered * by big international shippers, including three for Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
Miami - based Carnival said 0 the first of the three ships is scheduled *-2 to be delivered *-1 next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean.
The second ship is scheduled *-2 to be delivered *-1 in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991.
One analyst said 0 the first ship probably will be delivered *-1 close to schedule, but that Carnival may have *-2 to pay up to 25% more *PRO*-3 to get the second and third ships.
All the ships are covered *-3 by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency, even though it *EXP*-2's not clear whether they will actually be built *-4.
Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat *PRO* to withdraw its guarantee commitments, shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits.
State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy.
However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state - owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago.
In that case, international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed 0 the company's debt carried implicit state guarantees.
Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to *PRO* winning orders *T*-1, analysts warn 0 *T*-2.
Moreover, state - owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty *PRO* raising funds in international financial markets, bankers say 0 *T*-2.
The decision *ICH*-1 by a majority of state - appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday *PRO* to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about - face from previous government policy.
In August, the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard.
At the time *PRO*-1 71% - controlled by Oy Waertsilae, a conglomerate, the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated * at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation.
Under the rescue plan, Waertsilae sold 51% of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds.
The government, in turn, guaranteed financing *PRO*-1 to complete the order backlog and took control of the board.
Government officials were expected *-1 to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms, and thus ensure Finland's survival as a shipbuilding nation.
The government spent most of last year *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO*-2 to carry out such a plan but was thwarted *-1 when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute *T*-3.
After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and *PRO*-2 bolstered *-1 by state loan guarantees, two big bank creditors, Union Bank of Finland and state - controlled Postipankki, resumed *PRO*-2 lending the shipyard working capital.
But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained 0 they had been misled *-1 about the shipyard's actual financial condition, and hinted 0 the credit guarantees might be withdrawn *-2.
People familiar with Monday's board meeting said 0 it was the state's refusal *PRO* to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that *T*-1 led Union Bank and Postipankki *PRO*-2 to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine.
Then, in a boardroom showdown, state - appointed directors voted *PRO*-1 to file for bankruptcy, apparently under instructions from Finland's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen.
Analysts say 0 Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated * in August.
*PRO*-1 Noting that Sweden wound up *PRO*-2 wasting state subsidies of about 35 billion Swedish kronor ($5.47 billion *U*) during the 1970s in a vain attempt *PRO* to salvage its shipbuilding industry, one analyst suggested that Mr. Suominen may have decided *PRO*-3 to cut Finland's losses once and for all.
Senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt *PRO* to agree on some form of restructuring that *T*-1 would keep Waertsilae Marine operating.
The talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced *-1, people familiar with them said 0 *T*-2.
One solution would be *PRO* to sell the shipyard to an outsider.
But there appear *-1 to be few, if any, suitors.
Indeed, the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change tack and agree *PRO*-1 to pick up the bill, analysts said 0 *T*-2.
Meantime, shippers with vessels on order from Waertsilae Marine will remain in limbo.
The state - controlled French metals group Pechiney S.A. said 0 it has signed a preliminary accord *PRO* to sell its Paris headquarters to Groupement Foncier Francais and Nouveaux Constructeurs for 2.76 billion francs ($443 million *U*).
The sale, which Pechiney had been eager *PRO*-2 to make *T*-3 for several months, is still subject to certain unspecified conditions and is expected *-4 to be completed *-1 during the first quarter of 1990, the group.
CRESTMONT FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION (Edison, N.J.) --
Lawrence B. Seidman, 41 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chairman of this savings and loan institution.
He will succeed Charles L. Harrington, chairman and chief executive officer, who *T*-1 retired last month.
Crestmont is conducting a search for a chief executive.
Mr. Seidman, a director of Crestmont since July, is general partner of Seidman Financial Associates, which *T*-1 owns 9.89% of Crestmont.
Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of *PRO* indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation *T*-1?
Why do you maintain 0 the House - passed capital - gains plan is a "temporary" reduction when it is not *?* *T*-1 *T*-2?
I think 0 the reason is that you are confusing tax "rates" with tax "payments."
Your Sept. 29 page - one story on the House - passed capital - gains plan is a good example.
You lead readers *PRO*-1 to believe that the House reduced the capital - gains tax for two years only.
You virtually ignore the tax - reducing power of indexation, which in many cases *T*-1 is more substantial than a lower rate.
The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured *-1 *PRO* using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain.
Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than *PRO* using the 19.6% rate without indexation.
But in any event--and this is the important point--tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law, even though the tax "rate" is the same under both systems.
As you can see, the capital - gains reduction plan adopted * by the House would not be temporary, but permanent.
I hope that you begin *-1 talking about the plan's permanent and, in my view, most beneficial feature--indexation.
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif .) Washington
That the motivation for the two - year reduction to 19.6% is budgetary does not mean 0 it is not in the public interest.
The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital *PRO*-1 to seek more productive or more appropriate uses.
But what *T*-1 is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991.
*PRO* To argue that this is "not likely" *-1 to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital - gains tax cuts and to common sense.
A large part of the long - term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation - created capital gains is confiscation.
Does the Journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of *PRO* having a substantial part of their capital confiscated *-1 when they decide whether *PRO*-2 to save or how *PRO*-2 to invest *T*-3 *T*-4?
Under current law, it *EXP*-1 is not financially rational *PRO* to forgo consumption.
Real, aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1% or 2% a year.
The capital - gains tax reform is a step toward *PRO* correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy, the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates, weak capital formation and high capital costs.

The Federal Communications Commission allowed American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to continue *-1 offering discount phone services for large - business customers and said 0 it would soon re-examine its regulation of the long - distance market.
The FCC moves were good news for AT&T, which *T*-1 has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation.
Alfred Sikes, the new FCC chairman, championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency.
But it *EXP*-1 has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes, an extraordinarily cautious man, would continue *-3 pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what *T*-2 is likely *-4 to be great political pressure.
"It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance," said *T*-2 Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc., who *T*-1 attended the FCC meeting.
"All the commissioners were in amazing agreement {*PRO* to re-examine regulation} for *PRO* only having been together for a few months."
The FCC took three specific actions regarding AT&T.
By a 4 - 0 vote, it allowed AT&T to continue *-2 offering special discount packages *ICH*-1 to big customers, called * *PRO*-4 Tariff 12, *PRO*-3 rejecting appeals by AT&T competitors that the discounts were illegal.
Then by a separate 4 - 0 vote, it chose the narrowest possible grounds 0 *PRO* to strike down a different discount plan, called *PRO* *PRO*-3 Tariff 15, that AT&T offered *T*-1 to Holiday Corp *T*-2.
AT&T gave a 5% to 10% discount to the Memphis, Tenn., company that *T*-1 oversees Holiday Inns, in response to a similar discount offered * to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp.
The agency said that because MCI's offer had expired AT&T couldn't continue *-1 to offer its discount plan.
But the agency specifically didn't rule whether AT&T had the right *PRO* to match offers by competitors if that means *PRO* giving discounts not generally available to other phone users.
Indeed, Joe Nacchio, AT&T's vice president for business - communications services, said 0 AT&T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International, of Indianapolis, *PRO*-1 to meet another MCI bid.
The FCC "didn't say 0 I couldn't do it again," he said *T*-1.
Apart from those two actions, Mr. Sikes and the three other commissioners said 0 they expect *PRO*-2 to re-examine how AT&T is regulated *-1 *T*-3 *PPA*-4 since competition has increased.
Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common - carrier bureau, said 0 he expected the agency to propose new rules next year.
AT&T applauded the FCC's actions.
"The time *ICH*-4 is long overdue 0 *PRO* to take a look at the fierce competition in the long - distance business and the rules governing it *T*-3," the New York telecommunications firm said *T*-1 in a statement.
But MCI, of Washington, was displeased with the FCC decision concerning Tariff 12, *PRO*-1 arguing that "AT&T cannot be allowed *PRO*-2 to flaunt FCC rules."
United Telecommunications Inc.'s US Sprint unit said 0 it was "obviously disappointed" with the FCC decision on Tariff 12.
US Sprint said was 0 it will petition the FCC decision in federal court.
"We believe that the court will find it unlawful," said *T*-1 a US Sprint spokesman.
Separately, AT&T filed a countersuit against MCI *PRO*-1 accusing it of *PRO* misleading consumers through allegedly "false and deceptive" advertising.
The AT&T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight.
Earlier this month, MCI sued AT&T in federal district court, *PRO*-1 claiming that AT&T's ads are false.
AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington, all visibly angry, *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to refute MCI's charges.
"MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T," said *T*-2 PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman, who *T*-1 said 0 he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in *PRO* dealing with its longtime nemesis.

When President Bush travels to Costa Rica today *T*-2, he'll go with little of the fanfare that *T*-1 accompanies many of his foreign travels.
But the two - day trip still has managed *PRO*-1 to fuel controversy over his administration's policies in Central America.
Some conservatives say 0 Mr. Bush shouldn't make the trip, during which he will participate in Costa Rica's celebration of 100 years of democracy *T*-1.
These critics object to Mr. Bush's participation in a meeting that *T*-1 includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests.
In addition, they argue 0 he won't help Washington's standing in the region by *PRO* trumpeting the U.S. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an ineffectual role in the failed coup attempt in Panama.
"I believe 0 it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like Daniel Ortega," says *T*-2 Curtin Windsor, who *T*-1 served as U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica during the Reagan administration.
Mr. Windsor, among other analysts connected * to the conservative Heritage Foundation, fears 0 the gathering of 18 leaders, mostly from Central American nations, will force Mr. Bush "*PRO*-3 to explain and redeem himself" in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed *-1 to do enough *PRO*-2 to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
At the same time, liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time 0 his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country *T*-1.
The administration proposed only $57 million *U* in so - called economic support funds for Costa Rica this year, down from the $90 million *U* 0 the U.S. provided *T*-1 last year.
The administration said 0 improvements in Costa Rica's economic condition warrant the cut in aid, which the country uses *T*-1 mainly *PRO*-2 to make payments on its $4.5 billion *U* foreign debt.
But Costa Rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices, combined * with the country's continuing struggle *PRO* to reinvigorate its economy, make the support as necessary as ever.
"We are crossing the river and we need a little more help *PRO*-1 to get to the other side," said *T*-2 Rodrigo Sotela, an economic affairs specialist at the Costa Rican Embassy in Washington.
Democrats argue that Costa Rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that Mr. Bush is attending the celebration this weekend: *PRO* to reward the country for its stability in a region wracked * with turmoil and for its efforts *PRO* to promote peace in Nicaragua.
However, peace efforts by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias haven't always helped the country's cause in Washington.
Mr. Arias's long - time refusal *PRO* to support the U.S.'s campaign against leftist Nicaragua earned him the ire of the Reagan White House.
And more recently, he insisted on *PRO* signing a five - nation agreement intended *PRO* to disarm Nicaragua's U.S. - backed Contra rebels faster than the Bush administration would prefer *?*.
"I think 0 Bush's going there is a helpful sign," said *T*-2 Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C .) a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who *T*-1 pushed *PRO* to provide Costa Rica about the same amount of aid as it received * last year.
Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level.
Administration officials defend Mr. Bush's decision *PRO* to make the trip.
While they acknowledge 0 the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended * by Mr. Ortega, they insist that Mr. Bush won't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies.
The administration also made clear its continuing distate for the leftist Nicaraguan government in recent days, *PRO*-2 endorsing a package of electoral aid to the Nicaraguan opposition, renewing the U.S. trade embargo against the country and continuing *-1 to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region.
Officials also insist 0 Mr. Bush will use the trip *PRO*-1 to highlight his own initiatives for *PRO* pushing democracy in the region, fighting illegal drugs and assisting the less developed countries.
"*PRO* Let me say 0 there is a symbolic component to this trip," Secretary of State James Baker told reporters *T*-1 Wednesday.
"There won't be any formal resolutions or communiques, I don't think 0 *T*-1.
But we still see this as an opportunity *PRO* to discuss many, many very important issues.
S.A. Brewing Holdings Ltd. began *-1 laying the groundwork 0 *T*-2 to launch a rival offer for Bond Corp . Holdings Ltd.'s Australian brewing operations.
Such an offer could torpedo a plan *ICH*-1 by Lion Nathan Ltd. of New Zealand *PRO* to acquire half the brewing interests.
But it would probably increase the amount of cash that debt - ridden Bond Corp. would earn *T*-1 from the transaction.
Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission said 0 it will allow S.A. Brewing to acquire an option on as much as 20% of Bell Resources Ltd., a unit of Bond Corp. that *T*-1 is in the process of *PRO* acquiring Bond Corp.'s brewing businesses for 2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.93 billion *U*).
S.A. Brewing, which *T*-1 is 20% - owned by Elders IXL Ltd., Australia's largest brewer, will make a takeover offer for all of Bell Resources if it exercises the option, the corporate regulators said 0 *T*-2 in a statement.
Bond Corp., a brewing, property, media and resources concern controlled * by financier Alan Bond, is selling many of its assets *PRO*-1 to reduce an A$6.9 billion *U* debt.
A state appellate court reinstated the 1987 convictions of Pymm Thermometer Corp. and two of its executives on charges of assault for *PRO* exposing workers to toxic mercury vapors.
The indictment charged that Pymm operated a machine 0 *T*-1 to crush broken thermometers and recover the mercury in an illegal workroom.
The charges said that one worker suffered permanent brain damage from mercury exposure.
The judge handling the case in state Supreme Court, a trial court, had tossed out the jury verdicts, *PRO*-2 ruling that the matter should have been handled *-3 under federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules.
But the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held 0 that federal law didn't pre-empt the states from such a prosecution.
Elizabeth Holtzman, district attorney for Brooklyn, N.Y., said, "The appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal worker - safety laws, state prosecutors have the power *PRO* to protect working people."
Lawyers for the company and executives couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
The executives face five to 15 years in prison and fines of $5,000 *U* or double the profit made * by *PRO* failing *-1 to comply with the rules.
The company could be fined *-1 a maximum of $10,000 *U*, or double the profit.
Unocal Corp.'s decision *PRO* to put its Norwegian oil and gas interests up for sale earlier this week is another step in the company's strategic review of its properties, and shows that few of them are sacred cows.
The company declined *PRO*-1 to estimate the value of the Norwegian holding.
But Eugene L. Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., forecast that the sale will bring in "$200 million *U* or substantially more."
The proposed transaction is the latest in a redeployment of assets by the Los Angeles - based oil company that *T*-1 has included the $200 million *U* sale of its headquarters property and the pending sale of half of its Chicago refinery and related marketing operations to Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
Mr. Nowak said 0 he attaches particular importance to the proposed sale because it suggests that the company is willing *PRO*-2 to sell oil and gas assets that *T*-1 aren't part of its major strategic strengths.
Unocal said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to complete the sale of its Unocal Norge A / S unit by next March or April.
In addition to an 18% stake in the Veslefrikk offshore field, the Norwegian unit has interests ranging from 10% to 25% in three other Norwegian oil and gas production licenses.
In 1986, Unocal sold a 7.5% stake in the Veslefrikk field to Deutsche Erdolversorgungs G.m.b . H., a West German oil company, for an undisclosed amount.
In 1987, it sold a 2.5% stake in the Veslefrikk field to the Swedish national oil company, *PRO* resulting in a $7 million *U* after - tax gain.
However, those sales were early in the field's history, before production equipment was installed *-1.
The field is currently being developed *-1 and is slated *-1 *PRO*-2 to start production by the end of the year.
It's expected *-1 to produce about 62,000 barrels per day.
A company spokesman said 0 the Veslefrikk field's gross reserves were estimated *-1 in 1987 at 229 million barrels.
However, he added that that estimate, made * before extensive development drilling, currently is being reappraised *-1.
The spokesman said 0 Unocal has had "considerable interest" from prospective buyers.
The company has retained J. Henry Schroder Wagg & Co. as financial adviser and agent for the sale.
Weirton Steel Corp. said 0 it reached a tentative agreement on a 48 - month labor contract with the Independent Steelworkers Union covering production and maintenance employees.
The agreement, subject to approval of union members, would cover about 6,000 workers.
The tentative agreement provides for wage increases of 85 cents an hour retroactive to Sept. 25, 1989, and for increases of 19 cents, 70 cents and 35 cents an hour effective Jan. 1, 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively.
It also provides for benefit adjustments, including a partial restoration of vacations and holidays, as well as work - rule changes *PRO* to increase productivity.
California Thefts Make Travel Agents Jittery
*PRO* BEING A TRAVEL agent used *PRO*-1 to be pretty glamorous.
Now it's getting downright dangerous.
In recent months, more than 25 agencies have been robbed *-1, compared with only a handful all last year, according to police and travel - agency groups.
Most of the cases have been in California, where one agent was stabbed *-1 and another was shot and killed *-2 *T*-3.
Los Angeles police say 0 the thieves seem *-2 to be part of a crime network that *T*-1 knows how *PRO*-3 to convert blank tickets into real ones *T*-4.
Already, the stolen tickets have been used *-1 for flights all over the world.
So far, the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets, according to Airline Reporting Corp., a ticket processing center.
Police say 0 the robberies are usually pulled *-2 off by two to five men, who *T*-1 walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time, when few employees are there *T*-3.
"They looked like ordinary vacationers at first," says *T*-2 Willy LLerena, owner of Travel Air Service in Monte Bello, Calif., *PRO* describing five men who *T*-1 entered his agency last June.
But then, he says 0 *?*, they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded 0 he open the safe.
When he initially refused *T*-1, he says 0 *?*, they stabbed him in the back and made off with $2,000 *U* and 280 blank tickets.
"They said 0 they wanted *PRO*-1 to show me how serious they were *T*-2," he says *T*-3.
As word of the crime spree has spread, many agents have started *-1 changing their open - door policies.
At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte, Calif., customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system.
"It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to deal with clients this way in a service business," says *T*-4 Ralph "Bud" Conner, owner of the agency, which *T*-3 was robbed *-2 of 180 blank tickets and $850 *U* last month.
"But we're just too nervous."
The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines.
Agents say 0 airlines, which *T*-1 track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets, should be doing more *PRO*-2 to catch the thieves by *PRO* confiscating the tickets when they're used *-3 *T*-4.
"They have the most sophisticated computers in the world," says *T*-1 Mr. LLerena.
"They ought *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO*-1 to do this."
But airlines say 0 it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started *-1 using computerized scanners *PRO*-2 to check tickets at the gate.
Texans Get Reasonable Car Rental Insurance
CONSUMER advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance.
Now, a new law in Texas seems *-1 to be providing the proof.
The law--the first of its kind--requires car rental companies in Texas *PRO*-1 to charge only "reasonable" rates for collision - damage waiver insurance.
Specifically, the law says 0 the rates must closely reflect what the company's actual expenses have been *T*-1 *PRO* to replace damaged cars.
Before the law went into effect last month, car rental companies were charging as much as $12 *U* a day for the waiver in Texas.
Now, they're charging as little $3 *U* a day.
"If they're telling the truth now, then they've been charging 300% more than what *T*-1 is reasonable," says *T*-2 Steve Gardner, an assistant state attorney general in Texas.
A spokesman for Hertz Corp. acknowledges, "The waiver isn't a source of protection for consumers, but a source of revenue."
But Hertz points out that at least it's now charging only $3.95 *U* a day in Texas, while some competitors are charging $6.99 *U*.
The state attorney general's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices.
Flight Attendants Lag Before Jets Even Land
IF YOUR FLIGHT attendant seems *-1 a little weary, it may be because he or she has been working 20 straight hours.
A recent study for the Federal Aviation Administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work 16 hours or more straight--despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to 14 hours.
Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in 20 - hour work days, the study found 0 *T*-1.
This happens because the FAA doesn't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants; by contrast, it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers, usually to a maximum of 10 consecutive hours.
"As far as the FAA is concerned *-1," says *?* Matt Finucane, air safety director at the Association of Flight Attendants, "flight attendants can work an unlimited number of hours."
Experts say 0 such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk.
For instance, tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation.
"At the end of their day, they are zombies," says *T*-1 John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a public - interest group in Worthington, Ohio.
"They have *-1 to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there's an evacuation."
In response to the study, the FAA says 0 it is considering *PRO*-1 changing its policy--or lack of it--on flight attendants.
The agency may not have much choice: A congressional bill *ICH*-1 has been introduced *-2 that *T*-3 would force the agency *PRO*-4 to limit flight attendant duty time to 14 hours on U.S. flights and 16 hours on international trips.
Odds and Ends
GOLF HAS BECOME the latest diversion for travelers stuck * at some airports.
Simulated golf games, in which players hit golf balls into nets *T*-2, have been installed *-1 at airports in Denver and Pittsburgh....
The average cost for breakfast at a "decent" hotel restaurant in New York is $17.12 *U*, according to Corporate Travel magazine.
The cheapest, among 100 cities surveyed *, was $5.11 *U* in El Paso, Texas.
Exxon Corp. said 0 it will move its headquarters from Manhattan to Dallas.
Most of the 300 employees at the oil company's midtown headquarters building--including much of senior management--were unaware of the plan until *PRO* informed *-1 at a morning meeting by Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl.
The shift won't affect operations.
As part of its restructuring several years ago, Exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its 53 - floor Rockefeller Center skyscraper to a Japanese company.
But the pullout is an embarrassment to New York City officials, *PRO*-1 coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies.
Mobil Corp. is in the process of *PRO*-1 vacating its headquarters here, and huge operations like J.C. Penney & Co. and Trans World Airlines have recently left.
New York authorities, informed * yesterday about the move, reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation's third - largest corporation leaving without *PRO* giving them an opportunity *PRO* to accommodate it.
"We are dismayed, but there's nothing 0 we can do *T*-1 about it now," said *T*-2 Stanley Grayson, New York City deputy mayor for finance and economic development.
Meanwhile, Dallas welcomed the move.
City officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in, but negotiations had all been conducted *-1 through a law firm and under the code name "Everglades."
"When we were told *-1 0 it was Exxon *T*-2, it was beyond all expectations; what a coup," said *T*-3 Tom Lewis, senior vice president of Dallas Partnership, the economic development affiliate of the city's Chamber of Commerce.
Dallas, its economy based *-1 on oil and real estate, has been in a slump.
Exxon said 0 it will build a new headquarters on a 132 - acre tract in the 10 - year - old Las Colinas complex in the suburb of Irving.
Until the building is completed *-1, Exxon will rent part of an existing office tower.
Las Colinas, once a huge Texas ranch, is a sprawling complex of office buildings, homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling *PRO*-2 to populate *T*-1 in recent years.
Exxon officials said 0 it *EXP*-2 will cost less *ICH*-3 *PRO* to run its headquarters at Las Colinas than in New York.
The company won't say how much it will save *T*-1, but during at its interim location, sources say 0 it will likely pay rent of $10 to $15 *U* per square foot *T*-2.
Owners of the building in New York say 0 they will be asking $50 *U* per square foot for rent *PRO*-2 to fill the space that Exxon is vacating *T*-1.
In Texas, taxes and development costs are also lower, they said 0 *T*-1.
Plus, one Exxon official said 0 *?*, by *PRO* eliminating the typically long New York commutes between office and home, management will expect employees to work 40 hours a week in Dallas, rather than a 35 - hour work week in New York.
If you're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk - bond market, *PRO* consider the case of Columbia Savings & Loan.
The California thrift has just announced a $226 million *U* third - quarter loss.
How did this happen *T*-1?
Well, when Congress in its recent S&L bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk - bond holdings by 1994 *T*-2, it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments 0 thrifts have made *T*-1.
But there is a grimly ironic twist to the Columbia loss.
As followers of the debate over a capital - gains tax cut know *?*, there is much talk in Congress and indeed all over Washington about the need *PRO* to "encourage" long - term investment and discourage the financial sector's presumed obsession with the short term.
Now, we regard this as a largely phony issue, but the "long term" is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the Beltway.
It turns out that Columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new congressionally mandated rules forced it *PRO*-1 to adjust the book value of its *PRO* soon - to - be - sold *-2 junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value.
They could no longer be classified *-1 as what Columbia regarded them *T*-2, namely long - term investments.
Congress's ham - handed treatment of the existing structure of junk - bond holdings reminds us of a story in the Journal earlier this year about the Baby Bell companies' desire *PRO* to have the court - ordered bans *ICH*-2 lifted *-1 on *PRO* offering information services.
The issue of *PRO* seeking relief from Congress was raised *-1 to Delbert Staley, the chairman of Nynex.
Mr. Staley replied: "Legislation tends *-2 to be compromised *-1.
I believe 0 we have *-1 to take a shot at *PRO* getting as much *ICH*-4 done *-2 as we can *?* through the court, through Justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies.
I see Congress as a last resort."
Healthy thrifts such as Columbia or the junk - bond market itself should have been so lucky.
The reality of life in modern America is that if you want *PRO*-2 to wreck something that *T*-1 works, *PRO* let it fall into the hands of Congress.
We read with interest Robert Tomsho's Sept. 28 page - one article on Robert Redford ("The Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance").
*PRO*-1 Misunderstanding conversations with us, Mr. Tomsho argued that Mr. Redford's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents.
This may have been true 10 years ago, but times have changed, even in Utah.
Mr. Redford no longer stands out as an extremist.
He has not changed, but those around him have *?*.
Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas, rivers and canyons are now embraced *-1 by mainstream, conservative Utahans.
Recently, some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club, the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together *PRO*-1 to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project.
While Utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism, public views toward the environment have significantly improved.
In one of the most conservative, Republican states in the entire nation, the greening of Robert Redford's neighbors is the real story that Mr. Tomsho missed *T*-1.
Sammye Meadows Sam Rushforth Gary Bryner Heber City, Utah
If Mr. Redford wanted *PRO*-2 to be accepted *-1 by the people of Utah, he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of *PRO*-3 forcing his personal preferences.
Furthermore, his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power - plant construction, coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment, but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort.
It *EXP*-1 astounds me 0 he can rationalize his self - righteous and greedy actions in Utah.
An excellent environmental actor he is *T*-1.
David Vranian M.B.A. Student University of Colorado Boulder, Colo.
Mr. Redford, *PRO* like it or not, is like a braking system on a runaway truck, kind of *PRO*-1 slowing it down into control.
He's rich, famous and intelligent, and has the time 0 *PRO* to do something that not even the federal government will do *T*-1 *T*-2.
Mr. Redford is slowing down a mindless, speeding maniac known * as the progress of mankind.
Personally, I'm glad 0 there are people like him around 0 *T*-3 to slow down the profit takers, and those who *T*-1 are in such a blind hurry for something that *T*-2 may appear *-4 to benefit them in the immediate future, not *PRO* caring about the long - range implications.

Canadian steel production totaled 290,541 metric tons *ICH*-1 in the week ended * Oct. 21, a 5.1% increase from 276,334 tons the previous week but a 7.2% decline from 313,125 tons a year earlier, Statistics Canada said 0 *T*-2.
The federal agency said that in the year through Oct. 21 production totaled 12,573,758 tons, up 7.1% from 11,742,368 tons.
European Community employers fear that the EC Commission's plans for a "charter of fundamental social rights" is a danger to industrial competitiveness.
"We don't want Brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful," said *T*-1 Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, secretary general of the employers' confederation Unice.
Unice--an acronym for the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe--fears that the charter will force EC countries *PRO*-1 to adopt a single pattern in labor relations.
Workers and management, Mr. Tyszkiewicz said 0 *?*, would lose the "flexibility and diversity" that *T*-1 has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions.
The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form.
It argues, as does *?* Unice, that labor relations are best left *-2 *PRO*-3 to be regulated *-1 at the national level.
France will propose a slightly watered - down version of the charter 0 *T*-2 to be discussed *-1 by EC social - affairs ministers on Monday, officials said 0 *T*-3.
But the cosmetic changes aren't expected *-1 to win over Britain.
"We still have serious differences with the text," a British official said *?*, because it provides for a "regulation of the labor market."
Mr. Tyszkiewicz said 0 the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage.
It would force these countries *PRO*-1 to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours, and provide for collective bargaining and worker "participation" in major corporate decisions.
This, he warned 0 *?*, would prevent these countries from *PRO*-2 bridging the difference with their richer EC brethren.
Indeed, lower wages--in Greece, they are a third of the EC average--aren't enough *PRO*-1 to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries.
*PRO* Increasing labor costs, Mr. Tyszkiewicz argued 0 *?*, would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in *PRO* competing in the barrier - free EC market planned * for after 1992.
But the Unice official said that *PRO* producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry isn't an unattainable goal.
The charter would just have *-2 to be restricted *-1 to a list of workers' fundamental rights, without *PRO* seeking *PRO*-3 to impose any norms.
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate 0 *T*-1 to produce an "action program" detailing on what points EC member states would be required *-2 *PRO*-4 to comply with the goals set * out in the charter *T*-3.
This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of "social engineering" by the commission.
One possible political solution, an EC official said 0 *?*, would be for the commission to present the action program in late November, before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9.
This would leave Britain *PRO*-1 free *PRO* to adopt the charter after *PRO* having rebutted the action program.
The charter was approved *-1 by the EC Commission on Sept. 21.
France's Socialist government, which *T*-2 currently holds the council's rotating presidency, is committed *-1 to *PRO* having the charter adopted *-3 by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989--the bicentennial of the French revolution and its "Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Your Sept. 25 criticism of credit - card foreign - exchange charges is unwarranted.

A potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made * by novel genetic engineering techniques was described *-1 by a team of Italian, U.S. and Japanese scientists.
The team reported 0 they managed *PRO*-2 to induce bacteria *PRO*-3 to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced * by the bacterium that *T*-1 causes whooping cough.
Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of *PRO*-2 inducing an immunity to whooping cough, the researchers reported 0 *T*-1 in this week's issue of the journal Science.
The current vaccine for whooping cough, or pertussis, is part of the "DPT" (for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) shot given most infants and young children *.
The vaccine is effective in *PRO* preventing a disease that *T*-1 still afflicts about 60 million children a year world - wide, *PRO*-2 causing an estimated one million deaths.
The vaccine, however, causes allergic reactions that *T*-1 can be fatal.
The reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis bacterium, which *T*-1 causes whooping cough.
This bacterium produces a toxin that, if *PRO*-2 used *-3 as a vaccine, *T*-1 can induce immunity to whooping cough.
Unfortunately, the toxin is also poisonous.
The Italian - led scientific team said 0 they had succeeded in *PRO* getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin, which *T*-2 could be used *-1 as a safe vaccine.
The researchers reported 0 they have been able *PRO*-2 to pluck the five genes that *T*-1 produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium.
It turned out that although it *EXP*-1 took all five genes *PRO* to produce the toxin, only one was responsible for the toxin's virulence.
Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes, minus the one that *T*-1 caused the virulence, would have been transferred *-3 to another bacterium, called *PRO* *PRO*-4 E. coli, which *T*-2 would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin.
The researchers said 0 they did this, but the toxin didn't induce immunity to whooping cough.
The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that *T*-1 caused virulence.
Then, *PRO*-1 using a new technique (called *PRO* *PRO*-2 homologous recombination) for *PRO* introducing genes into cells, they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism.
These bacterial "cousins" ordinarily don't make the toxin.
But the genes were accompanied *-1 by a piece of DNA, called *PRO* *PRO*-3 a promoter, that *T*-2 turns the genes on.
The new bacteria recipients of the genes began *-1 producing pertussis toxin which, because of the mutant virulence gene, *T*-2 was no longer toxic.
Experiments showed that the new, non-virulent toxin is capable of *PRO* inducing immunity, according to the researchers from the Selavo Research Center in Siena, Italy, the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and the Japanese National Institutes of Health.
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to report an extraordinary loss of about $122 million *U* in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt.
The cable programmer said 0 the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties, and unamortized issue discount and costs related to its just - completed $1.6 billion *U* refinancing of its long - term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries.
A Turner spokesman wouldn't speculate on the extent of the charge's effect on the quarter's earnings, but said 0 the company continues *-1 to expect *PRO*-2 to report a net loss for 1989.
The company said 0 the repayment or redemption of the long - term debt, and the outstanding Class A cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of Cable News Network, was made *-1 possible by an offering of about $750 million *U* of debentures and notes and $900 million *U* in bank borrowings.
The offering included $550 million *U* of 12% senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $200 million *U* of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004.
The notes were priced *-2 *PRO*-3 to yield 8% and are convertible into the company's Class B common stock at a price which *T*-1 represents a 15% premium over the market price on Oct. 10, 1989.
In addition, the company called its 12 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 1994, with an aggregate principal amount of $200 million *U*, for redemption on Dec. 15.
As a result of the refinancing, the company said 0 the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than 11% from slightly more than 14%.
In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Turner's Class A stock closed at $50.50 *U*, down 37.5 cents.
Swedish rolling - steel and ball - bearing group AB SKF said 0 its pretax profit rose 78% to 1.78 billion kronor ($278 million *U*) in the first nine months from one billion kronor ($156 million *U*) in the corresponding period a year earlier.
SKF said 0 sales increased 17% to 18.46 billion kronor from 15.72 billion.
Earnings per share were 10.35 kronor compared with 5.80 kronor.
SKF said 0 demand for the group's main product, rolling bearings, remained favorable in Europe, which *T*-1 accounts for slightly more than two - thirds of group sales.
Latin American markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year, SKF said 0 *T*-1.
The company said 0 the situation in the U.S. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings.
Analysts said 0 SKF's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of 1.74 billion to 1.86 billion kronor.
The three business areas engaged * in rolling bearing operations continued *-1 to show favorable sales development.
Sales of rolling bearings increased 19% to 15.7 billion kronor from 13.2 billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year.
Sam Ramirez and his men are late.
They pile out of their truck and furiously begin *-1 twisting together steel pipes linking a giant storage tank to the Sharpshooter, a freshly drilled oil well two miles deep.
If they finish today, the Sharpshooter can pump tomorrow.
One roustabout, *PRO*-1 hanging by his hands from a ladder, bounces his weight on a three - foot wrench *PRO*-1 to loosen a stuck fitting.
"We've been putting in long hours," Mr. Ramirez says *?*--six - day weeks and 13 - hour days for the last two months.
A year ago, when almost nothing was happening amid these desolate dunes *T*-1, "you'd spend two days *PRO*-2 working and two days in the yard," he recalls 0 *T*-3.
After a three - year nightmare of uncertain oil prices, draconian budget cuts and sweeping layoffs, fear is finally leaving the oil patch.
Independent drillers are gingerly sinking bits into the Earth's crust again.
Some in Big Oil are easing the grip on their wallets.
Investment capital is creeping back, and oil properties are fetching more.
Oil - tool prices are even edging up.
What *T*-1 happened?
In broadest terms, stability has quietly settled into international oil markets.
Mideast politics have calmed down and the squabbling within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seems under control for now.
"The fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices," says *T*-1 Victor Burk, an Arthur Andersen & Co. oil expert.
After years of wild swings, oil prices over the last 12 months have settled at around $15 to $20 *U* a barrel.
That isn't the $40 *U* that *T*-1 delighted producers a decade ago or the $10 *U* that *T*-2 pleased users a year ago.
But it is high enough *PRO* to prod the search for future supplies, low enough *PRO* to promote consumption and, most important, steady enough for both producers and users to believe in *?*.
Not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again.
The current equilibrium is fragile and depends on steady, strong demand and continued relative harmony within OPEC, producer of more than 40% of the non-Communist world's crude.
A recession or new OPEC blowup could put oil markets right back in the soup.
Also, the new stirrings are faint, and some question their extent.
Drilling activity is still far below eight years ago, there's no hiring surge and some companies continue *-1 to shrink.
With all this, even the most wary oil men agree 0 something has changed.
"It doesn't appear *-1 to be getting worse.
That in itself has got *-1 to cause people to feel a little more optimistic," says *T*-2 Glenn Cox, the president of Phillips Petroleum Co.
Though *PRO*-1 modest, the change reaches beyond the oil patch, too.
The same roller - coaster prices that *T*-1 halted U.S. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation's inflation rate, the trade deficit and oil users' corporate and personal budgets.
Now, at least some predictability *ICH*-1 has returned, for everyone from economists to motorists.
Corporate planners can plan again.
"Management doesn't want surprises," notes *T*-1 Jack Zaves, who, as fuel - services director at American Airlines, *T*-2 buys some 2.4 billion gallons of jet fuel a year.
Prices had been so unstable that two years ago Mr. Zaves gave up on long - term forecasts.
And consumers "should be comfortable," adds *T*-1 W. Henson Moore, U.S. deputy secretary of energy.
"I don't see anything on the horizon that *T*-1 could lead to a precipitous rise in the price."
The catalyst for all this has been OPEC.
About a year ago, it ended an on - again, off - again internal production war that *T*-1 had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, abandoned a policy of *PRO* flooding the market *PRO*-1 to punish quota - cheaters.
About the same time, the Iran - Iraq war, which *T*-1 was roiling oil markets, ended.
In addition, global petroleum demand has been climbing.
It is projected *-1 to keep growing by a million barrels a day, or up to 2% annually, for years 0 *T*-2 to come.
For OPEC, that's ideal.
The resulting firm prices and stability "will allow both producers and consumers to plan confidently," says *T*-1 Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer.
OPEC Secretary - General Subroto explains: Consumers offer security of markets, while OPEC provides security of supply.
"This is an opportune time 0 *T*-1 to find mutual ways 0 {*T*-2 to prevent} price shocks from *PRO* happening again," he says *T*-3.
*PRO*-1 To promote this balance, OPEC now is finally confronting a long - simmering internal problem.
At its November meeting, it will try *PRO*-2 to revise its quotas *PRO*-3 to satisfy Persian Gulf members that *T*-1 can produce far more oil than their allotments.
*PRO* Being held *-1 well below capacity greatly irritates them, and has led to widespread cheating.
OPEC has repeatedly raised its self - imposed production ceiling *PRO*-1 to legitimize some of that unauthorized output.
Oil ministers now hope *PRO*-3 to solve the issue for good through an Iranian proposal that *T*-1 gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that *T*-2 can't produce more anyway.
But "if they walk out without any effort *PRO* to resolve their problem, production could increase to 23 million or 24 million barrels a day, *PRO* making for a very troublesome first quarter," warns 0 *T*-2 Nordine Ait - Laoussine, a consultant and former Algerian OPEC delegate.
That would send prices *PRO*-2 plummeting from what some gun - shy U.S. oil executives still regard *T*-1 as too low a level.
Patrick J . Early, president of Amoco Corp.'s oil - production unit, says that despite recent stability, he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending.
The view of some others in Big Oil, he maintains 0 *?*, "is very much {similar to} Amoco's outlook."
Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations.
Out here on the Querecho Plains of New Mexico, however, the mood is more upbeat; trucks rumble along the dusty roads and burly men in hard hats sweat and swear through the afternoon sun.
Santa Fe Energy Co., a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Co., bought from Amoco the rights that *T*-1 allowed it to drill the Sharpshooter.
A mile and a half away looms the 150 - foot - tall rig of the Sniper, due *PRO* to be pumping by December.
"Talk is that everybody is going *-1 to drill more wells," says *T*-2 foreman Tommy Folsom.
Santa Fe aims *PRO*-1 to drill about 30 wells in this area in 1989 and double that next year.
It is more aggressive than most, but it isn't the only company with a new attitude, as it found when it went looking for a partner for the Sharpshooter *T*-1.
"We went to six companies over two days *PRO*-1 pitching the prospect," says *T*-2 Tim Parker, a Santa Fe exploration manager.
"Five were interested."
Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. became the partner, *PRO*-1 ponying up more than half of the $600,000 *U* in drilling and start - up costs.
Mitchell will get a half - interest in the oil.
"A kind of no - mistakes mentality" had been stifling activity, says *T*-1 Don Covey, Mitchell's oil exploration chief.
Now "everybody is a lot more optimistic."
One attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the bargain - basement cost of drilling and equipment, reflecting service companies' hunger for work.
Kadane Oil Co., a small Texas independent, is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others.
One of its wells, in southwestern Oklahoma, is a "rank wildcat," a risky well where oil previously hasn't been found *-1 *T*-2.
"At this price, $18 *U* plus or minus, and with costs being significantly less than they were *?* several years ago, the economics are pretty good," *T*-2 says George Kadane, head of the company.
"If you know 0 you've got stability in price, you can do things 0 you wouldn't do *T*-1 with the volatility of the past few years."
The activity is enough *PRO* to move some oil - service prices back up a little.
Some drill - bit prices have risen 5% in the past month.
In the Gulf of Mexico, a boat 0 *T*-1 to deliver supplies to offshore rigs now costs around $3,000 *U* a day, up nearly 60% since June.
Some service boats recently were auctioned *-1 for about $1.7 million *U* each, up from less than $1 million *U* two years ago.
At the bottom of the slump, Schlumberger Inc. was discounting 75% on an electronic evaluation of a well; now it discounts about 50%, drillers say 0 *T*-1.
Still, there is money 0 *T*-2 to be made *-1.
Most oil companies, when they set exploration and production budgets for this year *T*-1, forecast revenue of $15 *U* for each barrel of crude produced *.
Prices have averaged more than $2 *U* a barrel higher than that--not a windfall, but at least a pleasant bonus for them.
So, according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey, companies that *T*-1 had been refusing *PRO*-2 to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end.
It says 0 40% of those surveyed * report that 1989 exploration spending will exceed 1988's.
Funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable.
Texaco, thinking in terms of $18 - to - $19 *U* oil for 1990, may raise spending, especially for low - risk prospects, an official says 0 *T*-1.
Outside investors, scarce since '86, are edging back.
Although "it *EXP*-1's still difficult *PRO* to raise money for a pure wildcat program," says 0 *?* William Thomas, a Texas Commerce Bank official in Houston, "institutions are starting *-3 to see 0 there are cycles to these things, and this one is beginning *-4 to turn."
Wall Street generally likes the industry again.
The appetite for oil - service stocks has been especially strong, although some got hit yesterday when Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its short - term investment ratings on them *T*-1.
Contractors such as Parker Drilling Co. are raising cash again through stock offerings, and for the first time in years, two oil - service companies recently went public.
(They are Grace Energy Corp. of Dallas and Marine Drilling Co. of Houston.)
Most oil companies are still reluctant *PRO*-2 to add to the office and professional staffs 0 they slashed *T*-1 so deeply.
But a few new spots are opening.
Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, has increased its energy staff 10% in a year.
Out in the oil fields, if activity picks up much more, shortages could appear because so many roughnecks, roustabouts and others left after the crash.
Already "it *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to get people.
They're so busy," says *T*-1 one Santa Fe drilling foreman here.
For most field workers, it's about time.
Mr. Ramirez, who *T*-1 arrived late at the Sharpshooter with his crew because he had started early in the morning *-3 setting up tanks at another site, just got the first raise 0 he can remember *T*-2 in eight years, to $8.50 *U* an hour from $8 *U*.
Norman Young, a "mud - logger" at the Sniper well, has worked all but about nine days of this year.
Last year, "I was off a straight month, then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks," he says 0 *T*-1.
Butch McCarty, who *T*-1 sells oil - field equipment for Davis Tool Co., is also busy.
*PRO*-1 A native of the area, he is back now after *PRO* riding the oil - field boom to the top, then surviving the bust *PRO*-2 running an Oklahoma City convenience store.
"First year 0 I came back *T*-2 there wasn't any work," he says *T*-1.
"I think 0 it's on the way back now.
But it won't be a boom again.
No major booms, no major setbacks," he predicts *T*-1.
Business has been good enough that he just took a spur - of - the - moment weekend trip to the mountain area of Cloudcroft, something "0 I haven't done *T*-1 in years."
The figures confirm that there certainly isn't any drilling boom.
Only 14,505 wells, including 4,900 dry holes, were drilled *-1 for oil and natural gas in the U.S. in the first nine months of the year, down 22.4% from the like 1988 period.
But that was off less than at midyear, when completions lagged by 27.1% *T*-1.
And the number of rigs active in the U.S. is inching up.
According to Baker Hughes Inc., 992 rotary rigs were at work in the U.S. last week, up from the year - ago count of 933.
(In 1981, before the bust, the rig count was above 4,000.)
Global offshore - rig use shows a similar upward trend.
Some equipment going to work is almost new.
Grace Energy just two weeks ago hauled a rig here 500 miles from Caspar, Wyo., *PRO*-1 to drill the Bilbrey well, a 15,000 - foot, $1 - million - plus *U* natural gas well.
The rig was built *-1 around 1980, but has drilled only two wells, the last in 1982.
Until now it had sat idle.
For Zel Herring, owner and a cook at the Sandhills Luncheon Cafe, a tin building in midtown, all this has made for a very good year.
After 11:30 a.m. or so "we have them standing and waiting," she says *T*-1, as she whips out orders for hamburgers and the daily special (grilled roast beef, cheese and jalapeno pepper sandwich on whole wheat, potato salad, baked beans and pudding, plus coffee or iced tea.
Price: $4.50 *U*).
Mike Huber, a roustabout, is even making it in his new career as an entrepreneur.
He started Arrow Roustabouts Inc. a year ago with a loan from a friend, since repaid *, and now employs 15.
He got three trucks and a backhoe cheap.
"I want *PRO*-1 to add one more truck," Mr. Huber says *T*-2.
I sense that it's going *-1 to continue *-2 to grow.
That's the word.
The word is out.
The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by *PRO* creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy.
The U.S. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling's tumble, as market participants switched out of pounds.
The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark, *PRO*-1 falling below the key 2.90 - mark level to 2.8956 marks from 2.9622 marks late Wednesday.
Mr. Lawson's resignation shocked many analysts, despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Indeed, only hours earlier, Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson's economic policies *PRO*-1 "sound" and said 0 she has "always supported" him.
"There was a general feeling that we'd seen the worst," said *T*-1 Patrick Foley, deputy chief economic adviser for Lloyds Bank in London.
"The resignation came as a great surprise."
Graham Beale, manager of foreign - exchange operations at Hong Kong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York, added that Mrs. Thatcher's comments reinforced the market's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit's later decline.
"The market was caught totally the wrong way....
Everyone was extremely long on sterling," Mr. Beale said *T*-1.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8400 marks, up from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday, and at 142.10 yen, up from 141.52 yen late Wednesday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.5765 *U*, sharply down from $1.6145 *U* late Wednesday.
In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.02 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 141.90 yen.
Few analysts had much good 0 *PRO* to say *T*-1 about the pound's near - term prospects, despite the fact that most don't anticipate a shift in Mrs. Thatcher's economic policies.
Mr. Foley of Lloyds noted that Mr. Lawson's replacement, John Major, the British foreign minister, will take time 0 *PRO* to establish his credibility *T*-1 and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade.
But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead, *PRO*-1 commenting that Mr. Major shares "a very similar view of the world" with Mr. Lawson.
Bob Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, also noted that the pound's sharp decline is pegged *-1 more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies.
Unless Mr. Lawson's resignation leads to a change in British interest - rate policy--Mrs. Thatcher's administration firmly supports high interest rates *PRO* to keep inflation *PRO*-2 in check--or *PRO* posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System's exchange - rate mechanism, Mr. Lawson's withdrawal will have little long - term impact on exchange rates, Mr. Chandross concluded 0 *T*-1.
Also announcing his resignation Thursday was *T*-2 Alan Walters, Mrs. Thatcher's economic adviser and Mr. Lawson's nemesis.
The pound, which *T*-1 had been trading at about $1.6143 *U* in New York prior to Mr. Lawson's announcement, sank more than two cents to $1.5930 *U*, *PRO* prompting the Federal Reserve Bank *PRO*-2 to buy pounds for dollars.
The Fed's move, however, only proved *-1 a stopgap to the pound's slide and the Fed intervened for a second time at around $1.5825 *U*, according to New York traders.
Meanwhile, dollar trading was relatively uninspired throughout the session, according to dealers, who *T*-1 noted that Thursday's release of the preliminary report on the U.S. third - quarter gross national product was something of a nonevent.
U.S. GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in the third quarter.
The implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation, was down to a 2.9% annual rate of increase in the quarter from a 4.6% rate of gain in the second quarter.
In Europe, the dollar ended lower in dull trading.
The market closed prior to Mr. Lawson's announcement.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $3.40 *U* to $372.50 *U* an ounce in heavy trading.
The close was the highest since August 3.
Estimated volume was five million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted *-1 at $370.85 *U* an ounce.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board said 0 it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments.
But the chief rule - making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made * earlier this year that *T*-1 would have required a breakdown of certain balance - sheet items related * to off - balance sheet instruments.
The balance - sheet detail was opposed *-1 by many banks and thrifts that *T*-2 felt 0 the cost of *PRO* supplying such data wasn't worth the value of the disclosures.
Under the initial proposal, for example, banks would have been required *-2 *PRO*-4 to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that *T*-1 reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted *T*-3.
The final rule won't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses, which *T*-1 appears on the balance sheet.
The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps, financial guarantees, foward interest rate contracts, loan contracts, loan commitments and options written * on securites held *.
It will require companies *PRO*-1 to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments.
The rule will require companies with financial instruments that *T*-1 have off - balance sheet risks *PRO*-4 to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments, any accounting loss that *T*-2 would occur if the outside party involved * in the instrument failed *-3 to perform, and the company's policy for *PRO* requiring collateral or other security for the instrument.
Scott Miller, an FASB project manager, said that a final rule will be issued *-1 before year end.
But he noted that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed *-1 by six months.
The European Community Commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between France's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds.
*PRO*-1 Meeting in Strasbourg Wednesday, the commission voted, as *PRO* expected *-2, *PRO*-1 to formally object to the accord between Air France, the state - owned airline, and state - controlled domestic carrier Air Inter.
An EC spokesman said 0 the two companies will be notified *-1 so they can begin negotiations with Brussels on how *PRO* to modify the pact *T*-2.
At issue is *T*-1 an accord dating back to March in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter's flight numbers and the domestic airline got *-2 to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France *T*-3.
The two shared results from this route swap, and followed rules on ticket pricing.
The EC Commission decided that such an accord doesn't benefit consumers enough *PRO*-1 to merit an exemption from antitrust law.
The airlines presented it as *PRO* offering consumers more choice and better flight connections.
An Air France spokeswoman said, "we're absolutely ready *PRO*-1 to study all solutions."
An Air Inter spokesman said, "Because they {the EC} have doubts, we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord.
South Africa's current account surplus swelled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of between five billion and six billion rand ($1.9 billion and $2.28 billion *U*) in the third quarter, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said 0 *T*-1.
The surplus was two billion rand in the second quarter and 2.7 billion rand in the first quarter.
He said 0 this improvement means 0 it is still possible *PRO* to reach the targeted current account surplus of four billion rand for 1989.
On an office wall of the Senate intelligence committee hangs *T*-1 a quote from Chairman David Boren, "*PRO* Don't hold your ticket 'til the show's over."
He once used that line in a closed - door meeting on Panama, *PRO*-1 meaning 0 *PRO* don't shrink from *PRO* taking action against Manuel Noriega.
So how did a good senator like this end up *-2 approving a policy that *T*-1 required the U.S. *PRO*-4 to warn Mr. Noriega of any coup plot against him *T*-3?
"I agree, it's ridiculous," says *T*-2 Mr. Boren, and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way 0 *PRO* to describe how the U.S. decides *PRO*-4 to take *RNR*-1--or rather, *PRO*-4 not to take *RNR*-1--covert action *T*-5 *T*-3.
George Bush disclosed the policy last week by *PRO*-1 reading it to GOP senators, perhaps as a way of *PRO* shifting blame for the Panama fiasco to Congress.
But the broader truth is more complicated--and dismaying.
The policy was contained *-1 in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council.
Staff lawyers for both sides were busy *PRO*-3 agreeing with one another about what the U.S. could not do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to oust the Panamanian thug.
They simply got carried away with *PRO*-2 interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant *T*-1.
Mr. Boren himself didn't discover the *PRO* warn - your - enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week.
It *EXP*-2's ironic that David Boren should be in the center of this mire.
*PRO*-1 A former Oklahoma governor, he's a thoughtful defender of presidential powers in foreign policy.
He's a rare Democratic hawk.
He's the senator most like Arthur Vandenberg, the GOP senator from Michigan who *T*-1 worked *PRO*-2 to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s.
"Vandenberg and Rayburn are heroes of mine," Mr. Boren says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 referring as well to Sam Rayburn, the Democratic House speaker who *T*-1 cooperated with President Eisenhower.
"They allowed this country to be credible.
I really want *PRO*-1 to see that happen again."
If this were 1949, Mr. Boren might even succeed.
But in 1989 most senators have other ideas.
Last July, his committee rejected a Reagan administration plan *PRO* to support a coup in Panama.
Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum refused *PRO*-2 to support any plan that *T*-1 might get people hurt, a charming notion for a great power.
Maine Republican William Cohen said 0 the plan might violate the assassination ban.
So the administration dropped it.
By October, when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal *T*-2, even the administration was agreeing 0 little should be done *-1.
Mr. Boren doesn't think 0 all this influenced the failed coup this month, but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes.
"In the aftermath of Vietnam, in the aftermath of Iran - Contra, I can understand 0 some people might think that if they plan a coup, they have *-1 to bring their lawyers," he says *T*-2.
But even Mr. Boren defends congressional oversight.
*PRO*-1 Writing in the Harvard International Review, he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there's a "consensus *T*-2."
So what does consensus mean *T*-1?
"It doesn't mean unanimous," he insists *T*-1, though he implies 0 it means a bipartisan majority.
"The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential," he explains *T*-1.
"Why was containment so successful *T*-1?
Because it had bipartisan support."
Mr. Boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions.
Elliott Abrams, a veteran of intelligence committee debates, doubts that even Grenada or the Libyan raid would have taken place if "consensus" had been required *-1.
Vandenberg and Rayburn were wise enough *PRO* to leave specific operations to presidents; modern senators, Mr. Boren notwithstanding, are less modest.
The result is that the Senate committee has what *T*-1 amounts to veto power over every covert action.
"I wouldn't say 0 it's quite a veto," Mr. Boren demurs *T*-1.
But wouldn't a president who *T*-1 acted despite Senate objections be taking grave political risks?
"He would *?*," agrees *T*-1 the chairman.
"But that is something 0 the president ought *-2 to know *T*-1 before he goes ahead."
Mr. Boren even spies a silver lining.
He figures 0 the episode will help *PRO* "clarify any ambiguities" between the committee and administration.
He points to a letter on his desk, his second in a week from President Bush, saying that they "don't disagree."
More broadly, Mr. Boren hopes that Panama will shock Washington out of its fear of *PRO* using military power.
"Maybe this will jolt us out of the post-Vietnam syndrome that we never are prepared *PRO*-1 to use force," he says *T*-2.
Maybe--if every senator shared the principles of Mr. Boren.
But it *EXP*-3's just as plausible *PRO* to argue that if even David Boren can get mired in this sort of mess, the problem goes beyond legal interpretation.
Maybe the problem is a political system that *T*-1 won't act without an "exchange of letters," that *T*-2 insists on *PRO*-4 running foreign policy by committee, that *T*-3 treats a president as just another guy at the table.
The reply of the Metzenbaums and Cohens is that we can't abolish these oversight committees because we've seen too many abuses of executive power.
But Panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that *T*-1 produces an absurd gridlock.
The lawyers are now in charge of our national security.
In Panama, the U.S. interests at stake were happily minor; the only people killed * were foreigners hapless enough *PRO* to trust American will.
Americans may not be so lucky the next time.
Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh - Pemberton urged banks to be cautious in *PRO*-1 financing leveraged buy - outs.
"Caution should...be the rule of the day," said *T*-1 Mr. Leigh - Pemberton in a speech to the Association of Corporate Treasurers' annual dinner.
"It would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general, *PRO* to say nothing of banks, if prudence does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions."
His remarks were distributed *-1 to the press before Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced his resignation last evening.
Bank of England officials said 0 the central bank had no comment on Mr. Lawson's resignation.
Mr. Leigh - Pemberton reiterated that the exposure of United Kingdom banks to leveraged deals haven't yet reached "worrying levels."
However, in light of the risks involved * in such transactions, banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills 0 *PRO* to participate in this market *T*-1 and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions, he said 0 *T*-2.
In other comments, he said 0 takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of *PRO* securing a change of corporate direction or strategy.
"A similar result could sometimes be achieved, *-1 at less cost, by *PRO* changing managements," he said *T*-2.
Eight people, including a supervisor of Security Pacific National Bank's central vault, were arrested *-1 in an investigation of an alleged drug money - laundering operation.
The U.S. Attorney's office filed a criminal complaint against six bank employees *PRO*-2 charging them with conspiracy in the scheme, which *T*-1 apparently was capable of *PRO* handling millions of dollars a week by *PRO*-3 funneling cash through fictitious bank accounts.
Two other men also were charged *-1 with *PRO* participating in the operation.
The arrests capped a four - month investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Attorney's office and a Security Pacific internal investigation team.
Walter S. Fisher, executive vice president and general auditor of the bank's parent, Security Pacific Corp., said 0 no bank funds were at risk during the investigation.
Arrested *-1 were *T*-2 Jose O. Lopez, 27 years old, of Whittier, Calif., the vault supervisor; Carlos O. Huerta, 29, of La Puente; Luis A. Arroyo, 36, of Los Angeles; Ignacio Rojas Jr., 32, of Baldwin Park; Doris Moreno, 37, of Bell Gardens; and Ana L. Azucena, 27, of Huntington Park.
Geno M. Apicella, 27, of Los Angeles, and Terrell N. Madison, 27, of Hawthorne, were also charged *-1 with *PRO* participating in the conspiracy.
Each defendant faces a possible sentence of 20 years in prison and $250,000 *U* in fines.
The defendants couldn't immediately be reached *-1 for comment.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power *PRO* to close the stock markets in periods of crisis.
In testimony to the Senate securities subcommittee, Mr. Brady disputed the view of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, who *T*-1 told a House panel Wednesday that he doesn't want the ability *PRO* to halt the markets.
Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors *ICH*-4 were *-2 to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed *-1 *T*-3.
He added that the president already has the power *PRO* to close the markets in an emergency.
But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position 0 *PRO* to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed *-1 *T*-3 *T*-2.
Separately, Mr. Brady said 0 he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets *PRO*-1 to determine whether futures margins are too low.
He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced *-1 to levels below those before the 1987 crash.
"This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate," Mr. Brady said *T*-1.
Margins are the amount of money 0 an investor needs *-2 to put *T*-1 up *PRO*-2 to buy or sell a futures contract.
Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered *-1 according to market volatility.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange margins for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock - index futures stood at $10,000 *U* a contract for speculators and $5,000 *U* for hedgers before Oct. 16, 1987; that day the hedging margin was raised *-1 to $7,500 *U*.
Margins were raised or lowered *-1 about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19, 1987.
Currently, they stand at $12,000 *U* for speculators, who *T*-1 are typically individuals and non-member traders, and $6,000 *U* for hedgers, which *T*-2 are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks.
Mr. Brady also said 0 he expects the leveraged buy - out phenomenon to "end under (its) own weight."
*PRO*-2 Asked *-3 whether there is anything 0 Congress should do *T*-1 *PRO*-4 to curb the LBO boom, Mr. Brady responded, "I think 0 the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past."
Before *PRO* taking any action, he advised the panel *PRO*-2 to "see what the market has produced *T*-1 as a cure."
Mr. Brady also agreed with senators' concerns about recent stock - market volatility, and said 0 he realizes that the gyrations are scaring investors from *PRO*-1 investing in stocks.
But he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds.
The former Wall Street executive refused *PRO*-2 to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading, which *T*-1 has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed *-3 for *PRO* accelerating the drop two weeks ago.
"I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time," he said *T*-1.
But Mr. Brady endorsed the market - revision bill that both houses of Congress will try *PRO*-2 to push *T*-1 through this session.
That bill, proposed * by the SEC last year, would require brokerage firms *PRO*-1 to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets.
The bill also would give the SEC the power *PRO* to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted *T*-1 but Mr. Breeden doesn't *?* *T*-1.
Mr. Brady and senators agreed *PRO*-1 to have their staffs meet within the next week *PRO*-2 to start *-3 fine - tuning the bill.
Efforts *ICH*-3 by the Hong Kong Futures Exchange *PRO* to introduce a new interest - rate futures contract continue *-2 to hit snags, despite the support 0 the proposed instrument enjoys *T*-1 in the colony's financial community.
Hong Kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest - rate futures for a long time.
The contract was first proposed *-2 more than two years ago, but shortly afterward, the colony's markets were hit *-1 hard by the October 1987 global stock crash.
The subsequent drive *PRO* to reform Hong Kong's markets also has embroiled the interest - rate futures contract.
The Securities and Futures Commission, a government watchdog set * up after the 1987 crash *PRO* to try *PRO*-1 to restore confidence and order to Hong Kong's markets, had been expected *-2 to give the contract conditional approval last week.
But regulators this week said 0 futures - exchange officials still have a way 0 *PRO* to go *T*-1 before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract.
The exchange had forecast that the contract would begin *-1 trading by December.
But securities regulators now say privately that it isn't likely *-1 to start until the first quarter of next year.
Analysts and financial officials in the British colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, which *T*-1 has never fully recovered from the October 1987 crash.
Many believe that without a healthy futures exchange, Hong Kong's aspirations *PRO* to be recognized *-1 as an international financial center will suffer.
In addition, local banks say 0 the new contract is important in *PRO* helping them offset their Hong Kong - dollar exposure.
The contract will be based *-1 on the three - month Hong Kong interbank offered rate, or Hibor.
It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Eurodollar contract, which *T*-2 is based *-1 on the three - month Eurodollar rate, the rate paid * on U.S. - dollar deposits in London banks.
If the contract is as successful as some expect *?*, it may do much *PRO*-1 to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong.
"The contract is definitely important to the exchange," says *T*-1 Robert Gilmore, executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission.
Two years ago, the futures exchange was the envy of other *PRO* would - be futures centers.
After only 17 months, its main contract, based on the Hang Seng index, had grown *PRO*-1 to be the second - largest stock - index - futures contract in the world.
{A futures contract is an agreement *PRO* to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date.
In the case of stock - index and interest - rate futures, the instruments are given *-1 an underlying cash value and are settled *-1 in cash.}
But in the week following the 1987 stock crash, the exchange verged on collapse, and the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong were closed *-1 for four days.
Only a government - sponsored bailout kept the crisis from *PRO*-1 swallowing the exchange.
*PRO* Trading in Hang Seng index futures remains crippled by the experience.
Volume for the entire month of September totaled only 21,687 contracts, compared with a daily average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987 crash.
Despite the thin trading, and after two painful years of restructuring, the futures market has shown itself *PRO*-1 to be resilient in two recent tests.
While Asian markets struggled *PRO*-1 to cope with the uncertainty caused * by the Oct. 13 plunge in New York stock prices, futures trading in Hong Kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly.
That was also the case in the days following the June 4 massacre in Beijing, which *T*-1 caused a sharp drop in Hong Kong stock prices.
"There was no problem at all," says *T*-1 Douglas Ford, chief executive officer of the futures exchange.
Most important to the contract's success is *T*-1 the commitment of Hong Kong's big financial institutions, especially the two leaders, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and the local subsidiary of Britain's Standard Chartered Bank PLC.
The two big banks were instrumental in *PRO* designing the new contract.
"If those two banks are there, then the balance of the banking institutions will be there," says *T*-1 Mr. Gilmore, the Securities and Futures Commission official.
Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move *T*-1 because of their enormous Hong Kong - dollar exposure.
Even though the currency is pegged *-1 to the U.S. dollar, with a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.8 *U* to the American currency, the U.S. and Hong Kong economies don't always move in lock step, *PRO* making it *EXP*-3 difficult *PRO* to predict where interest rates in the colony will go *T*-2.
In early 1988, when the three - month Eurodollar rate was between 7% and 8% *U* *T*-1, the three - month Hibor rate was as low as 1%.
Just a few months ago, the three - month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5%, while three - month Hibor hit highs above 11%.
The Hibor contract "solves quite a bit of the problem of interest - rate risk in the interbank market," says *T*-1 Eric Cheng, a director of James Capel (Far East) Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of the British brokerage firm.
Despite the initial support expected *, trading in the contract is likely *-1 to start slowly.
The wounds from the 1987 crash haven't yet healed, and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse--by those who *T*-2 bet 0 the Hang Seng index would fall--have been settled *-1.
Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of *PRO* trading in its futures market.
And Mr. Gilmore cautions that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow *T*-1 because the Hong Kong dollar isn't a widely traded currency.
He says 0 the contract will be considered *-1 a success if it starts *-2 trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day.
Exchange officials also point out that Hibor futures were designed *-1 for institutions and corporations, not for the type of small individual investors who *T*-2 were very active in Hang Seng index futures and defaulted in the 1987 crash.
Mr. Cheng says 0 the low margin required * for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors *ICH*-1 before the 1987 crash who *T*-2 didn't realize that their risk was virtually unlimited.
"You're not going *-1 to get your taxi drivers and amahs and all that," says *T*-2 Rory Nicholas, a director for securities company Elders Bullion & Futures Ltd.
That should help *PRO*-2 to inspire confidence, Mr. Gilmore says 0 *T*-1.
But many bankers remain nervous, especially as the start - up of the contract continues *-2 to be delayed *-1.
Hong Kong's main measure of consumer prices rose 10% in September from a year earlier, the government said 0 *T*-1.
The Consumer Price Index "A", which *T*-1 measures price changes for the 50% of urban households that *T*-2 spend between 2,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$256.18 *U*) and HK$6,499 *U* a month, edged up 1.5% in September from August.
Index "B", which *T*-1 monitors price changes for the 30% of urban households that *T*-2 spend between HK$6,500 and HK$9,999 *U* a month, rose 9.9% last month from a year earlier and was up 1.3% from the preceding month.
September's Hang Seng Consumer Price Index, which *T*-1 measures price changes for the 10% of urban households spending HK$10,000 *U* and HK$24,999 *U* a month, was up 11% from a year ago and up 1.3% from August.
The main factors for the September increase from the previous month were higher prices for services, food and housing.
Prices *ICH*-1 fell marginally for fuel and electricity.
Bethlehem Steel Corp. has agreed in principle *PRO*-1 to form a joint venture with the world's second - largest steelmaker, Usinor - Sacilor of France, *PRO*-2 to modernize a portion of Bethlehem's ailing BethForge division.
The venture, which *T*-1 involves *PRO* adding sophisticated equipment 0 *T*-3 to make cast - iron mill rolls, is part of a two - pronged effort 0 *T*-4 to shore up a division that *T*-2 has posted continuing operating losses for several years.
The other element includes *PRO* consolidating BethForge's press - forge operations.
The entire division employs about 850 workers.
While the joint venture affects only a small part of Bethlehem's operations, it is significant because it marks the first time 0 the nation's No. 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner *T*-1.
Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for *PRO* not following its major competitors in *PRO* linking with a foreign company *PRO*-1 to share costs and provide technology 0 *T*-2 to modernize old facilities or build new ones.
"We think 0 it's a step in the right direction for Bethlehem," said *T*-1 Felix Bello, WEFA Group's international steel analyst.
"It *EXP*-1's important *PRO* to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked *T*-2."
He said 0 the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies, one that *T*-1 could open up new markets for Bethlehem.
Bethlehem had little choice but *PRO* to go with a European steelmaker, because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders, analysts noted 0 *T*-1.
Under terms of the agreement, Usinor's Chavanne - Ketin unit and Bethlehem would establish a modernized facility 0 *T*-1 to make cast - iron mill rolls at the company's cast - iron shop here.
Terms for the venture, which *T*-1 would be jointly owned *-2 by both companies, weren't disclosed *-3.
The Usinor unit has agreed *PRO*-1 to provide technology and expertise *PRO*-2 to install a so - called spin caster by early next fall.
The caster improves the metallurgical quality of the iron mill rolls, which *T*-1 are basically huge rolling pins used * *PRO* to flatten or shape steel products.
Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union *PRO*-1 to consolidate BethForge's two machine shops and four heat - treatment facilities of the press - forge operations.
Once the consolidation is complete, Bethlehem plans *PRO*-1 to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication, hardened steel and large - diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom - die applications.
Bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned *PRO*-1 to restructure the BethForge division *PRO*-2 to improve its cost structure.
In the second quarter, Bethlehem posted a $50 million *U* charge related to its plans *PRO* to realign the division.
At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into West Germany's financial center *T*-1, the opening of a three - man office on a Frankfurt side street shouldn't attract much attention.
Unless, of course, it happens *-2 to be run *-1 by the Rothschilds.
After an 88 - year absence from the birthplace of the family banking empire, the return of the Rothschild group to Frankfurt was greeted *-1 by the glare of television lights, curious reporters and a mayoral reception in Town Hall.
Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here, the family describes its move as a calculated decision *PRO* to set up a financial services outlet in Europe's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992.
Yet the Rothschilds don't deny an emotional element to the decision.
In 1796, Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples *PRO*-1 to begin the bank's expansion during the early 19th century.
The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild, and the family's banking activities focused on London and Paris.
Baron Elie de Rothschild, the family's elder spokesman, explains that by the end of the 19th century, Berlin had replaced Frankfurt as Germany's financial center.
Yet the chief reason for the closure, he says 0 *?*, was rooted in a family tradition that *T*-2 wouldn't allow a bank to bear the Rothschild name without a Rothschild in its management.
"At the time we had only daughters," explains *?* the 72 - year - old patriarch, "so we had *-2 to close the bank."
Much of the family's mystique remained.
Although its palatial residence was destroyed *-1 by bombs during World War II, the Rothschilds' place in Frankfurt's history is still recalled *-2 by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name.
The family's long absence is understandable.
The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s.
During the Third Reich, the Rothschilds were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers.
The persecution pursued the Rothschilds across Europe as the Nazis grabbed countries, *PRO*-1 confiscating the family's property in the process.
American journalist William L. Shirer, in his book "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," wrote of how in Vienna he had witnessed "squads of {Nazi} SS men carting off silver, tapestries, paintings and other loot from the Rothschild palace *T*-2."
In the immediate postwar years, the Rothschilds concentrated on *PRO* rebuilding their other European operations, *PRO*-1 delaying their return to Frankfurt.
"For a member of the Rothschild family, the return to Frankfurt is a very meaningful event, although it might not mean as much to German banking as it means to us," says *T*-1 Baron David de Rothschild, Elie's younger cousin and a partner in Rothschild & Cie . Banque in Paris.
Indeed, the competition isn't greatly concerned.
"It would be surprising if they didn't come to Frankfurt in time for 1992, and they bring an interesting tradition.
But the market really isn't going *-2 to be stood *-1 on its head," said *T*-3 a banker at one of Frankfurt's Big Three banks.
The return of the Rothschilds is modest.
The new representative office, with one manager and two assistants--none a member of the Rothschild family--will carry out no banking operations of its own.
Instead, it is *-1 to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family's mainstay banking units: N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. in London, Rothschild & Cie. in Paris and Rothschild Bank AG in Zurich.
The constraints don't bother the office's 54 - year - old manager, Erich Stromeyer.
He left his job as general manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.'s Frankfurt office because, he says 0 *?*, "When the Rothschilds called *T*-2, I couldn't resist."
Each Rothschild bank is linked *-1 by family ties and cross-ownership.
In March, N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of #4.1 billion *U* ($6.51 billion *U*) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million *U*), respectively.
The Paris bank doesn't publish that figure.
In Europe, the Rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as European industry restructures ahead of 1992.
Yet the group's limited resources makes it a niche player.
"Obviously, there are quantitative limitations on the assistance 0 we can provide *T*-1," concedes *?* Baron David de Rothschild, "but we feel 0 we have some cards 0 *PRO* to play *T*-3."
Among them, he says 0 *?*, is *T*-1 the family's traditional ties to old wealth and decision - makers in banking and industry throughout Europe and beyond.
The Rothschilds hope *PRO*-1 to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity *PRO*-2 to attract private and institutional investors.
As at the Zurich bank, the minimum investment for individuals *ICH*-2 will be high: about a million German marks ($538,000 *U*), three times what many other West German investment banks require *T*-1.
"But we do make exceptions," says *?* a smiling Baron Elie de Rothschild, "especially if they are very young and have very rich parents.
Environmental concerns are beginning *-1 to have as much influence in oil - industry spending plans as the price of crude does *?*.
In the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill in March, new governmental drilling bans are sharply curtailing exploration in promising locations offshore and in Alaska.
At the same time, moves toward tighter air - quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that *T*-1 don't pollute as much as fuel refined * from "heavy" crudes, generally high in sulfur.
Over the years, the world's stream of oil has been growing heavier.
So the scramble *ICH*-1 is on for lighter crudes globally, and for natural gas in the U.S. .
Recently Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, traditional heavy - crude producers, have boasted of new finds of light, low - sulfur oil by their national oil companies.
Venezuela has also earmarked $200 million *U* in new money for light - crude exploration.
And some oil companies are trying *PRO*-1 to lock in future supplies.
Typical is *T*-2 Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, Italy's state - owned energy company, which *T*-1 not long ago acquired through its AGIP oil subsidiary a 5% share in the consortium accounting for half of Nigeria's oil output.
AGIP already has an oil stake in Libya.
Both countries produce high - quality, low - sulfur crudes especially suited * to *PRO* making high - octane motor fuel at minimum refining cost.
Franco Reviglio, ENI chairman, looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry--he calls it *PRO*-1 a "revolution" requiring huge investments--as a result of environmental issues.
He made a special trip *PRO*-1 to examine U.S. environmental trends because they are often followed *-2 in Europe.
ENI needs *-2 to know what *T*-1's coming as it prepares *PRO*-3 to spend some $1.3 billion *U* on *PRO* upgrading its refineries, he says 0 *T*-4.
Oil companies world - wide will have "*-3 to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that *T*-2 will be required *-1," says 0 *T*-4 John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system, including the way 0 service stations pump fuel into cars *T*-1.
In the U.S., the search for oil had been headed *-1 toward environmentally sensitive areas believed * to have vast reserves.
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought *-1 to hide more than three billion barrels of oil.
Until the tanker spill, Big Oil was slowly convincing authorities 0 it could safely produce from such places.
Now the wildlife refuge has been closed *-1 to the industry, possibly for years.
Similarly, a group of companies led * by Chevron Corp. has been unable *PRO*-1 to pump oil found * off the California coast in the early 1980s.
A huge production system built * in the sea off Santa Barbara and ashore is sitting idle.
But the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas.
More than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas, partly on the assumption that demand *ICH*-2 will rise for a fuel that *T*-1 is cleaner *PRO* to burn than either oil or coal.
Activity has revived in the largest U.S. gas - producing regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico.
Santa Fe International Corp., which *T*-2 is owned *-1 by Kuwait (and *T*-2 isn't related *-4 to Santa Fe Southern Pacific's unit), is stepping up development of a well off Texas' Matagorda Island where it found gas in 1987 *T*-3.
"We could have sat on it longer, but the impetus is *PRO* to get the gas to the marketplace," says *T*-1 Richard Poole, senior scout for Santa Fe International.
"We're trying *PRO*-1 to get it on line as soon as possible now."
This month, Exxon Corp. announced plans for a 400 - day project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma--the deepest drilling project in the U.S. .
Exxon will use a Parker Drilling Co. rig built * in 1981 that *T*-1 can go down 9 1/2 miles.
William J. Russo was named *-1 *PRO*-2 senior vice president, public affairs and advertising, for this financial and travel services concern's American Express Bank Ltd. subsidiary.
Mr. Russo, 38 years old, previously was first vice president, public affairs and advertising, at the banking unit.
In 1987, the Presidents Commission of the NCAA, which *T*-1 oversees most U.S. intercollegiate sports, contracted with the Washington - based American Institutes for Research *PRO*-3 to do a survey on the college experiences of what the body chooses *PRO*-2 to call *T*-4 *PRO*-5 student - athletes.
A brief "executive summary" was issued *-1 last April, and attracted some, but not much, attention.
More - detailed reports followed, and attracted even less notice.
I suspect 0 I may be one of the few people 0 *T*-1 to have read them all.
The sixth and last report now is out, and it puts the effort in perspective.
*PRO*-3 Titled *-2 "*PRO*-4 Comments From Students," it focuses on the real shame of college sports: what *T*-1 happens to young athletes once they enter academe.
It's little less than a cry for help from those who *T*-1 make the costly show possible.
The previous five reports were mainly statistical, but clear enough in outline.
They showed that participants in Division I football and men's basketball, the big - time "revenue sports," entered school with poorer high - school grades and test scores than "minor - sport" jocks and students who *T*-1 participated in other extracurricular activities, and they got lower grades once they got there, at least partly because of the athletic demands placed * on them.
The football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and homework combined * (30 hours a week versus 25.3).
Almost half (49.8%) reported *-1 suffering "mental abuse" from coaches, and almost one - quarter (24.8%) said 0 they had been pressured *-2 *PRO*-3 to ignore injuries.
But even those numbers don't describe the situation as well as the athletes do *?* in their own words.
The composite portrait that *T*-1 emerges isn't of a pampered jock marking time until he can land a seven - figure pro contract--he's part of a tiny minority.
Rather, it's of a kid (we're talking about 17 to 22 year olds here) having a tough time *PRO* making the best of what *T*-1 will probably be his one shot at college.
The pertinent question, coming at the end of a lengthy, confidential questionnaire, was this: "Are there things about your college life 0 you would like *PRO*-1 to tell us *T*-2 that we didn't ask about *T*-3?"
*PRO*-2 Of the almost 3,000 athletes surveyed *, 1,240 took the time 0 *PRO* to respond *T*-1.
Here are *T*-1 a few of their answers:--"They say that I am a student - athlete, but really I'm an athlete - student.
They lied to me on the recruiting trip.
Football is the No. 1 thing here".
-- Junior football player.
-- "*PRO* Being a student - athlete at college is a lot different from high school.
First, the sport 0 you play *T*-1 is no longer a game--it becomes a job.
Your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing *PRO*-1 to take the time 0 *PRO* to watch you progress *T*-2.
You become expendable.
Your interest is not taken *-1 to heart because people only care about your performance".
-- Freshman basketball player.
-- "The coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes--not treat us like pieces of meat.
They always say 0 *PRO* to get a degree first, but they don't allow us time or *PRO* to skip practice *PRO*-1 to study for a test.
They just want *PRO*-1 to get their job done at any cost to the athlete".
-- Freshman football player.
-- "The pressure *ICH*-1 put * on us *PRO* to win at all times has resulted in physical violence, such as punching and slapping by coaches.
Some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large herd of animals.
In other words, they treat you like a piece of meat".
-- Sophomore football player.
-- "*PRO* Playing intercollegiate sports doesn't give you a lot of time 0 *PRO* to spend *T*-1 with others.
We are almost left *-1 out of {campus} social activities.
This mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring".
-- Freshman football player.
-- "You talk about free time--.what free time?
Time 0 *PRO* to relax and enjoy ourselves *T*-1 is always taken *-2 up by something 0 *T*-3 to do with football (meetings, *PRO* lifting weights, conditioning or films).
There is no recovery period--it's *PRO* go, go, go.
ABUSE to our bodies is overwhelming.
With our schedule, it's hard *PRO* to sleep well *PRO*-2 knowing what *T*-1 is going *-3 to happen the next day".
-- Junior football player.
-- "Physical exhaustion and depression are common in my life and in some of my teammates' lives".
-- Football player, class unspecified.
-- "More often than not, college athletes go through college *PRO*-1 never really experiencing collegiate life to the fullest.
One has *-1 to establish one's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part, not a whole, of the student - athlete's life".
-- Sophomore basketball player.
-- "Somehow, and I don't know how, the game needs *-2 to be played *-1 for fun again, and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative TV contracts".
-- Graduate - student football player.
There have been rumblings that, at long last, changes may be in the works.
The Knight Foundation, of Akron, Ohio, has established a national commission 0 *T*-1 to look into college - sports reform, and the NCAA Presidents Commission earlier this month recommended *PRO* cutting spring football practice in half, moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to 25 games from 28.
The key word in that paragraph, though, is "may."
NCAA Executive Director Richard Schultz, in *PRO* accepting a place on the Knight Commission, urged that the panel take a "balanced" view, which *T*-1 looks for all the world like a plea 0 *T*-3 not to rock the boat too much, and the presidents' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the NCAA's full convention in January, which *T*-2 will vote on them.
I read that one unnamed athletics director predicted that the basketball - cutback proposal could fail because of "real world" (i.e., economic) considerations.
But the "real world" also includes the unpleasant truth that colleges are cheating the athletes 0 they have wooed and won *T*-1.
If they won't change their ways voluntarily, maybe somebody bigger--Congress--should make them *?*.
Northrop Corp. received a $93.5 million *U* contract by the U.S. Air Force for production tooling and test equipment for the Tacit Rainbow defense - suppression missile.
The contract provides additional equipment for Northrop, the prime contractor on the missile, and also supports a 1990 purchase of 90 missiles for follow - on flight tests.
Isaac Hersly, 41 years old, was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief operating officer of this designer and marketer of graphics, video, cable and other television - related equipment.
He succeeds Alfred O.P. Leubert, 66, who *T*-1 continues as chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Hersly formerly was group vice president of marketing and product planning for Chyron and president of the telesystems and video products division.
Moscom Corp. said 0 its board approved the repurchase of as many as 300,000 common shares when market conditions are suitable *T*-1.
The maker of telecommunications management systems had 6,420,268 shares outstanding as of Sept. 30.
In over - the - counter trading yesterday, Moscom closed at $4.375 *U*, up 37.5 cents.
Bausch & Lomb Inc. said 0 it plans *PRO*-2 to introduce next year a new line of sunglasses containing melanin, the pigment that *T*-1 protects against damage from ultraviolet rays.
The optical products company has signed a licensing agreement with Photoprotective Technologies Inc., a closely held firm in San Antonio, Texas, which *T*-1 has developed a method 0 *PRO* to incorporate the synthetic melanin into plastic lenses *T*-2.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division said 0 it is offering $750 *U* cash incentives on all 1990 models of its full - size Blazer and Suburban truck lines.
Chevrolet already has cash incentives on the 1989 models of these vehicles.
The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 2.5% annual rate *ICH*-1 in the third quarter, the same pace as the second quarter, despite the worst trade performance in six years, the Commerce Department reported 0 *T*-2.
Personal spending, buoyed * by a burst of automobile buying, was the main catalyst to the economy's expansion.
But trade, one of the economy's main forces in the past few years, showed a sharp deterioration.
Imports of goods and services soared, while exports were flat.
Some economists found the mixture ominous.
"For the past two years, the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth.
You can't rely now solely on consumer spending *PRO*-2 to sustain the economy on a solid growth path," said *T*-1 Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter, many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls, partly because of higher prices on models introduced * last month.
Many economists think 0 the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade, because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper.
And business investment--which *T*-1 slowed in the third quarter, according to yesterday's report--is expected *-2 to continue *PRO*-3 to be sluggish.
A sharp reduction in inflation was by far the brightest spot in the report on the real gross national product--the inflation - adjusted market value of all the goods and services 0 the economy produced *T*-1.
An inflation gauge that *T*-1 measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter from 5% in the second.
Much of the moderation came from declining energy prices, which *T*-1 have since turned up a bit, analysts said 0 *T*-2.
Consequently, Michael Darby, undersecretary for economic affairs at the Commerce Department, said 0 inflation probably will edge up from the third - quarter rate in the final three months of 1989.
But he said 0 he believes 0 the second quarter's 5% rate "will prove *-1 to have been this year's peak quarterly inflation rate."
Generally, the Bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5% pace *PRO*-1 "good, solid growth," although he said 0 he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter.
He added: "Inflation is lower than I think 0 people expected it to be *?*, and I think 0 that's good news."
But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report, which *T*-2 showed the deficit in the country's trade of goods and services swelling to a $74 billion *U* annual rate in the third quarter from a $51 billion *U* rate in the second quarter.
Mr. Darby called it *PRO*-1 a "disappointment" but predicted 0 exports will pick up again.
"We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports," said *T*-1 Daniel Van Dyke, vice president of U.S. forecasting at Bank of America in San Francisco.
"I can't believe 0 it will continue," he added *T*-1, *PRO*-2 noting that the economies of the country's major trading partners are strong and prices of U.S. products are still competitive.
Some analysts also were disturbed *-1 by a pickup in the growth of business inventories.
While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP, it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs.
According to the report, inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $24.6 billion *U* in the third quarter, up from a $19.5 billion *U* pace in the second quarter.
Manufacturers' stocks fattened at an $18.4 billion *U* annual rate, up from $8.3 billion *U*.
"That suggests 0 there is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected *?*," said *T*-1 Edward Boss, senior financial economist at Continental Bank in Chicago.
"I don't think 0 it's anything that *T*-1's going *-2 to cause a downturn in economic activity.
But it will slow production."
Devastation from Hurricane Hugo, which *T*-1 slammed into the Southeast coast in late September, diminished personal income by about $4 billion *U*, the department said 0 *T*-2, but it called the effect on the roughly $5 trillion *U* economy *PRO*-3 "negligible."
Except for the loss from the hurricane, all the figures were adjusted *-1 for seasonal factors and inflation.
Here are *T*-1 some of the major components of the gross national product expressed * in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:
In the third quarter, the implicit price deflator fell to 2.9% of the 1982 average, from 4.6% in the previous quarter.
Southam Inc. said 0 its unprofitable weekly newspaper, The Financial Times of Canada, is up for sale.
Analysts said 0 the announcement, the latest in a series of divestitures and restructuring moves, is aimed *-1 at *PRO* improving Southam's earnings before the expiration *ICH*-2 in June of a standstill pact with Torstar Corp.
When that agreement expires *T*-1, Torstar will be free *PRO*-2 to increase its 22.4% stake in Southam, or *PRO*-2 to make an offer for the whole company.
Descendants of the Southam family hold an additional 22.6% stake in the Toronto - based company, Canada's largest newspaper publisher.
The newspaper could fetch between 15 million and 20 million Canadian dollars (US$12.8 million to $17.1 million *U*), said 0 *T*-2 one analyst, who *T*-1 asked not *PRO*-3 to be identified *-4.
A spokesman for Southam declined *PRO*-3 to comment on the price 0 the company is seeking *T*-2 or on estimates of the paper's annual losses, which most analysts place *T*-1 at between C$4 million and C$7 million *U*.
Yesterday, Southam reported third - quarter earnings of C$10.8 million *U* on revenue of C$395.4 million *U*, down from C$14.6 million *U* on revenue of C$389.6 million *U* in the year - ago quarter.
"*PRO*-1 To be profitable, the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking," said *T*-2 John Macfarlane, the paper's publisher.
Southam said 0 the level of future investment required * by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas.
The acquisition of the Financial Times of Canada is "well within reach for any number of media companies, both public and private," said *T*-1 James Cole, an analyst with Toronto - based BBN James Capel Inc.
Possible bidders include Christopher Ondaatje, a Toronto financier and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp Inc., a holding company controlled * by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Mr. Ondaatje sold his stake in Pagurian Corp. to Hees earlier this year and is said *-1 to be seeking a media acquisition.
Mr. Ondaatje couldn't be reached *-1 for comment, but Roy Mac - Laren, chairman of CB Media, a closely held concern that *T*-2 publishes two business magazines, said 0 his company would take a close look at the newspaper.
Mr. Cole said 0 the sale of the 77 - year Financial Times, which Southam has owned *T*-1 since 1961, is consistent with Southam's strategy of *PRO* cutting costs *PRO*-2 to obtain maximum profits from its operations while *PRO*-3 disposing of "chronically under - performing" assets.
Southam agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its 47% stake in Selkirk Communications Ltd., a broadcasting concern, to Maclean Hunter Ltd. for about C$285 million *U* last year.
This year, it has moved *PRO*-1 to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales, while *PRO*-2 reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas.
The Financial Times of Canada has no links to the British daily newspaper, The Financial Times.
Peter W. Likins, president of Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa., was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this maker of industrial motion - control parts and systems.
His appointment expands the board to 13 members.
West Germany's cost - of - living index rose a preliminary 0.3% in October from September and was up 3.3% from a year earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said 0 *T*-1.
The increase follows a monthly rise of 0.2% in September from August.
Preliminary cost - of - living data for the current month are calculated *-1 based on inflation data from the four largest West German states--Baden - Wuerttemberg, North Rhine - Westphalia, Bavaria and Hesse.
They want late - night shuttles to the biology labs.

And like college radicals everywhere, they are talking about a demonstration--where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands, classroom style *T*-1.
Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly *T*-1 at gatherings of Harvard University's new Society of Nerds and Geeks, or SONG.
SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they aren't going *-1 to take it anymore, at least not without *PRO*-2 trying a few really neat ideas first.
"We could have called ourselves *PRO*-2 the Academic Intellectual Society, but then everyone would have said, ` Oh, you mean the nerd - and - geek club,"' Leonid Fridman, SONG's graduate - student adviser, told 19 attendees at the club's inaugural meeting *T*-1 earlier this month.
Membership has since swelled to between 20 and 25.
Some people may think of nerds as calculator - toting, socially awkward individuals with shirt - pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical.
Geeks, by at least one definition, are chicken - mutilating circus freaks.
But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn, a Harvard junior, thinks of nerds and geeks more as "nonconformists," albeit with a studious bent.
One of the group's first projects is a "procrastination hot line" that students could call *T*-1 when they have an urge *PRO* to delay *PRO*-2 studying *T*-3.
The club plans *PRO*-1 to show nerdy movies, such as "Real Genius," in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers *T*-2; and naturally, the "Revenge of the Nerds," a tale of college males with runny noses and ill - fitting pants.
One of its "more ambitious goals" is *PRO* to get Jaime Escalante, the Los Angeles high - school mathematics teacher featured * in the film "*PRO* Stand and Deliver," to come to Harvard for a guest lecture.
Nerds and geeks sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at Harvard.
So Mr. Kahn says 0 high priority is being given *-1 to *PRO* creating a computerized matchmaking service "where instead of *PRO* being matched *-2 for eye color, you could be matched *-3 for similar intellectual interests *T*-4."
For instance?
"I'm a math major, but I want *PRO*-1 to know about psychobiology.
Hopefully, I'd find someone in psychobiology who *T*-1 wanted *PRO*-2 to know more about mathematics."
It could work.
Meanwhile, *PRO* finding a volunteer 0 *T*-1 to write the computer program isn't a problem.
Two of Japan's largest paper manufacturers, Oji Paper Co. and Jujo Paper Co., posted unconsolidated pretax profit gains from a year earlier *ICH*-1 for the first half ended Sept. 30, on continuing robust domestic demand for paper products.
Oji Paper, the nation's largest in terms of sales, said 0 its pretax profit rose 1.5% to 23.11 billion yen (US$163.3 million *U*) from 22.76 billion yen.
Sales jumped 12.2% to 232.12 billion yen from 206.87 billion yen.
Net income increased 6.7% to 12.43 billion yen from 11.66 billion yen.
Per - share net rose to 20.48 yen from 19.51 yen.
Oji Paper's sales strength was evident in overall paper products sales, including newsprints, printing and wrapping papers, which *T*-1 rose to 221.61 billion yen in the first half from 200.70 billion yen a year earlier.
Pulp, processed and miscellaneous paper sales also surged.
For the full fiscal year ending next March, Oji predicted that total sales of 477.00 billion yen, up from 420.68 billion yen in the previous fiscal year.
Pretax profit is seen *-1 at 45.00 billion yen, down from 47.17 billion yen, while net income is estimated *-2 at 23.500 billion yen, up from 23.031 billion yen.
The company didn't provide an explanation for the softer pretax profit performance and officials couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
Jujo Paper said 0 its pretax profit rose 0.3% to 13.05 billion yen from 13.02 billion yen.
Sales rose 8.5% to 195.19 billion yen from 179.916 billion yen.
Net income surged 10% to 7.12 billion yen from 6.47 billion yen.
Per - share net rose to 14.95 yen from 14.44 yen.
General paper product sales, including newsprints and other papers, accounting for the bulk of sales, rose to 157.78 billion yen from 143.88 billion yen.
Jujo Paper predicted that for the full fiscal year ending next March 31, sales will total 400.0 billion yen, up from 366.89 billion yen.
Pretax profit was estimated *-1 at 23.0 billion yen, down from 25.51 billion yen, while net income was estimated *-2 at 12 billion yen, up from 11.95 billion yen.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,000 for the week ended * Oct. 14 from 396,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said 0 *T*-1.
The number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended * Oct. 7 fell to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.1% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate was 2.2% *T*-1.
*PRO* Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended * Oct. 7 fell to 1,784,400 from 1,810,700 a week earlier.
These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.

Albert Engelken and Robert Thomson had never met, though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined *-1 in a way peculiar to the sports world.
Mr. Engelken, now a transit - association executive in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Thomson, a paper - products salesman in Montvale, N.J., hadn't even talked to each other.
But one recent day, they became much closer.
Mr. Engelken, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages *PRO*-1 to chart the exploits of "my favorite and not - so - favorite teams and players."
He often groans, he says 0 *?*, at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions 0 he is offered *-1 *T*-2 *PRO*-1 to play the game."
His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called *PRO* *PRO*-2 "Jurisprudence" that *T*-1 recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers.
Like many sports buffs, Mr. Engelken has turned cynic.
But his is a story about a hero in an era of sports anti-heroes, and about what Babe Ruth, Mr. Engelken reminds us 0 *?*, once called *T*-1 "*PRO*-2 the only real game in the world."
To Mr. Engelken, it is also a story "about love, because I'm blessed *PRO*-2 to have a wife who *T*-1 still thinks 0 her slightly eccentric husband's 50th birthday deserves the ultimate present."
*PRO*-4 To understand what Mr. Engelken means *T*-3, one must go back to a sunny October afternoon in 1951 at New York's Polo Grounds stadium, where, it can be argued *-1, the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played *-2 out *T*-5.
It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three - game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants (the predecessor to the San Francisco Giants scheduled *PRO* to play in tonight's world series).
Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams, and now it had come to this: a battle between the two for the National League pennant--down to the last inning of the last game, no less.
Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and shouted at the top of their lungs.
Mr. Engelken was doing the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where, with his nose pressed * against the front window of the Passaic - Clifton National Bank, he watched the duel on a television set 0 the bank set up *T*-1 for the event *T*-2.
The playoff series had riveted the 12 - year - old Giants fan.
"The Giants struck first, *PRO*-1 winning the opener, 3 - 1, on a two - run homer off Dodger right - hander Ralph Branca," Mr. Engelken recalls *T*-2 with precision today.
"The Giants got swamped in the second game, 100, and trailed 4 - 1 *PRO*-1 going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game.
The Giants scored once and had runners *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 on second {Whitey Lockman} and third {Clint Hartung} as Bobby Thomson advanced to the plate."
The rest, as they say *?*, is history.
Mr. Thomson, a tall, Scottish - born, right - hand hitter, stepped into the batter's box.
"Thomson took a called strike," Mr. Engelken recounts *T*-1.
The tension mounted as Ralph Branca, again on the mound, stared down the batter.
He wound up and let loose a fastball.
The pitch sailed toward Bobby Thomson high and inside and then, with a crack of the bat, was sent *-1 *PRO*-2 rocketing back into the lower leftfield stands.
"Giants fans went into euphoria," says *T*-1 Mr. Engelken.
And Bobby Thomson was made *-1 a legend.
The same Bobby Thomson *ICH*-2, it turns out, who *T*-1 sells those paper - goods today.
There can't be an older baseball fan alive who *T*-1 doesn't clearly remember that Bobby Thomson homer, who *T*-2 can't tell you where he was when he heard the famous Russ Hodges radio broadcast--the one that *T*-3 concluded with Mr. Hodges shouting, over and over, "The Giants win the pennant, the Giants win the pennant *T*-4 *T*-5!"
Mr. Engelken and Mr. Thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years, and the Polo Grounds, located * under Coogan's Bluff in upper Manhattan, was replaced *-1 by a public - housing project.
Mr. Thomson played outfield and third base until 1960, *PRO*-1 posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before *PRO*-2 retiring and going into paper - goods sales.
Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951.
When his wife, Betsy, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 *T*-1, Mr. Engelken--no slouch on the romantic front--gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than Bobby Thomson's home run."
The couple's first dog, Homer, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 after the Great Event, though unwitting friends assumed 0 he was the namesake of the poet.
And when Mr. Engelken's sister, Martha, who *T*-2 was born *-1 two days before the home run, reached her 25th birthday *T*-4, Mr. Engelken wrote his sports hero *PRO*-3 to tell him of the coincidence of events.
Mr. Thomson sent off a card to Martha: "It doesn't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run *PRO*-1 to celebrate your birth," it read *T*-2.
Martha was pleased, but nowhere near as much as Mr. Engelken.
The family license plate reads "ENG 23," the first three letters of the family name and--no surprise here--Bobby Thomson's uniform number.
And on Mr. Engelken's 40th birthday, his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. Thomson *PRO*-2 to be autographed *-1.
"What *T*-1 could have been better?" asks *T*-2 Mr. Engelken.
Betsy Engelken asked the same question earlier this year, when her husband was about to turn 50 *T*-1.
She had an idea.
On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it *EXP*-1 should be noted *-3 *?* *T*-4), Betsy, Al and their college - bound son set out for New York *PRO*-2 to visit Fordham University.
Mrs. Engelken had scheduled a stop on the New Jersey Turnpike *PRO*-1 to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor.
The papers would be handed *-1 over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10.
"It sounded like something out of Ian Fleming," Mr. Engelken recalls *T*-1.
At the appointed exit, the family pulled over, and Mrs. Engelken went *PRO*-1 to get her papers.
Mr. Engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window.
In a matter of minutes, she was back, with a tall, silver - haired man in tow.
She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname:
"Bertie," she said *T*-1, "Happy 50th Birthday.
This is Bobby Thomson."
"And there he was *-1," recalls *T*-2 Mr. Engelken.
"The hero of my youth, the one person in history 0 I'd most like *PRO*-1 to meet *T*-2.
*PRO* Keep your Thomas Jeffersons, or St. Augustines or Michelangelos; I'd take baseball's Flying Scot without hesitation."
They talked of the home run.
"I thought 0 it was in the upper deck," said *T*-1 Bobby Thomson, now 66 years old.
They talked of the aftermath.
"I never thought 0 it would become so momentous," Bobby remarked *T*-1.
Mr. Engelken, says 0 *?* his wife, "was overwhelmed *-2 by the whole thing.
It was worth it, just for the look on Albert's face."
The two men spent an hour at Exit 10, *PRO*-1 rehashing the event, "*PRO*-1 fulfilling the lifelong dream of a young boy now turned * 50," Mr. Engelken says *T*-2.
His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca "*PRO*-1 a very fine pitcher."
And when Mr. Engelken asked him why he took time *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 off from work for somebody 0 he didn't even know *T*-4 *T*-5 *T*-6, Bobby Thomson replied: "You know, Albert, 0 if you have the chance *ICH*-3 in life *PRO* to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation *PRO* to do it."
In an interview, Mr. Thomson, who *T*-1 is married *-2 and has three grown children, says 0 he has few ties to baseball *ICH*-3 these days, other than *PRO* playing old - timers games now and again.
But his fans, to his constant amazement, never let him forget the famous four - bagger.
His mail regularly recalls "my one event," and has been growing in recent years.
In response to the letters, Mr. Thomson usually sends an autographed photo with a polite note, and rarely arranges a rendezvous.
But when Betsy Engelken wrote him, *PRO*-1 saying 0 she could stop near his New Jersey home *T*-2, it seemed *-4 different.
"What a good feeling it *EXP*-3 would be *T*-2 for me to do that," he says 0 he thought *T*-4.
When the Engelken family got back from its trip up north *T*-3, Mr. Engelken wrote it all down, *PRO*-2 just to make sure 0 no detail was missed *-1.
"On the way home," his notes recall *?*, "it took concentrated effort *PRO* to keep that car pointed * south.
My mind was miles north at a place called *PRO* *PRO*-3 Coogan's Bluff, where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who *T*-1 never fully grew up and is all the richer for it *T*-2.
"*PRO* Take heart, sports fans," he wrote *T*-1.
"Real heroes exist.
You might not find one in the ` Jurisprudence' column.
But who *T*-1 knows?
You might meet up with him at that bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10 of the New Jersey Turnpike.
Mark Q. Huggins was named *-1 *PRO*-2 executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Mr. Huggins, 39 years old, formerly was controller and chief accounting officer at Harte - Hanks Communications Inc.
Management Co. manages entertainers and produces, markets and finances entertainment.
Kinder - Care Inc. was dropped *-1 from the consumer services industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market index because the company split itself in a restructuring.
It was succeeded *-1 in the group by Fuqua Industries Inc.
Both moves are effective today.
Toni Johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what *T*-1 was once a stately Victorian home.
A deep trench *ICH*-1 now runs along its north wall, exposed * when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week's earthquake *T*-2.
A side porch was ripped *-1 away.
The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn.
The remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree.
The petite, 29 - year - old Ms. Johnson, dressed * in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain, is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life & Casualty.
She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday, when an army of adjusters, employed * by major insurers, invaded the San Francisco area *PRO*-1 to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Equipped *-2 with cellular telephones, laptop computers, calculators and a pack of blank checks, they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters, buy food, replace lost clothing, repair broken water heaters, and replaster walls.
Some of the funds will used *-1 *PRO* to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction.
Many adjusters are authorized *-1 *PRO*-2 to write checks for amounts up to $100,000 *U* on the spot.
They don't flinch at *PRO* writing them.
"That's my job--*PRO* get {policyholders} what they're entitled to *T*-3," says *T*-4 Bill Schaeffer, a claims supervisor who *T*-1 flew in from Aetna's Bridgeport, Conn., office.
The Victorian house that Ms. Johnson is inspecting *T*-2 has been deemed *-1 unsafe by town officials.
But she asks a workman toting the bricks from the lawn *PRO*-1 to give her a boost through an open first - floor window.
Once inside, she spends nearly four hours *PRO*-2 measuring and diagramming each room in the 80 - year - old house, *PRO*-2 gathering enough information *PRO* to estimate what it *EXP*-3 would cost *T*-1 *PRO* to rebuild it.
She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster that *T*-1 has fallen away from the walls.
While she works inside, a tenant returns with several friends *PRO*-1 to collect furniture and clothing.
One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop and starts *-3 to pack what *T*-2 can be salvaged *-1 from the kitchen.
Others grab books, records, photo albums, sofas and chairs, *PRO*-1 working frantically in the fear that an aftershock will jolt the house again.
The owners, William and Margie Hammack, are luckier than many others.
A few years ago, Mrs. Hammack insisted on *PRO* buying earthquake insurance for this house, which *T*-2 had been converted *-1 into apartments.
Only about 20% of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage.
The Hammacks' own home, also in Los Gatos, suffered comparatively minor damage.
Ms. Johnson, who *T*-1 works out of Aetna's office in Walnut Creek, an East Bay suburb, is awed *-2 by the earthquake's destructive force.
"It really brings you down to a human level," she says *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to accept all the suffering 0 people are going through *T*-2, but you have *-3 to *?*.
If you don't *?*, you can't do your job."
For Aetna and other insurers, the San Francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched *-1 *T*-2.
Most companies still are trying *PRO*-1 to sort through the wreckage caused * by Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas last month.
Aetna, which *T*-1 has nearly 3,000 adjusters, had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte, Columbia, and Charleston.
Adjusters who *T*-1 had been working on the East Coast say 0 the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through December.
It *EXP*-1 could take six to nine months *PRO* to handle the earthquake - related claims.
When the earthquake rocked northern California last week *T*-1, Aetna senior claims executives from the San Francisco area were at the company's Hartford, Conn., headquarters for additional training on how *PRO* to handle major catastrophes, including earthquakes *T*-2.
Since commercial airline flights were disrupted *-1, the company chartered three planes *PRO*-3 to fly these executives back to the West Coast and bring along portable computers, cellular phones and some claims adjusters.
Because of the difficulty of *PRO* assessing the damages caused * by the earthquake, Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country.
Even so, few had ever dealt with an earthquake.
Some adjusters, like Alan Singer of San Diego, had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks.
He returned home last Thursday, packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty Friday in Walnut Creek.
Offices were set *-1 up in San Francisco and San Jose.
In a few instances, Aetna knew 0 it would probably be shelling out big bucks, even before a client called or faxed in a claim.
For example, officials at Walnut Creek office learned that the Amfac Hotel near the San Francisco airport, which *T*-2 is insured *-1 by Aetna, was badly damaged *-4 when they saw it on network television news *T*-3.
"The secret to *PRO* being a good adjuster is counting," says *T*-1 Gerardo Rodriguez, an Aetna adjuster from Santa Ana.
"You have *-1 to count everything."
Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms, balconies, fireplaces, chimneys, microwaves and dishwashers.
But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding, *PRO*-1 to come up with a total value for a house.
*PRO*-1 To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot.
*PRO*-2 Using a calculator and a unit - price guide for such jobs as painting, plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country, adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today's market and what it would cost *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to rebuild it.
Sometimes repairs are out of the question.
When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday *T*-1, he found them living in a mobile home parked * in front of their yard.
The house itself, located * about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double - decker highway Interstate 880, was pushed *-1 about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement.
The next day, Mr. Schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $151,000 *U* *PRO*-1 to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood.
He also is working with a real - estate agent *PRO*-2 to help find them an apartment 0 *PRO* to rent *T*-3 while their home is being built *-1.
Many of the adjusters employed * by Aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or carpentry.
But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson.
Four years ago, she was managing a film - processing shop and was totally bored.
A friend mentioned that she might want *PRO*-2 to look into a position at Aetna, if she was interested in a job that *T*-1 would constantly challenge her.
She signed up, *PRO*-2 starting as an "inside" adjuster, who *T*-1 settles minor claims and does a lot of work by phone.
A year later, she moved to the commercial property claims division.
She spent a month at an Aetna school in Gettysburg, Pa., *PRO*-1 learning all about the construction trade, including masonry, plumbing and electrical wiring.
That was followed *-1 by three months at the Aetna Institute in Hartford, where she was immersed *-2 in *PRO* learning how *PRO*-3 to read and interpret policies *T*-4 *T*-5.
Her new line of work has some perils.
Recently, a contractor saved her from *PRO*-3 falling three stories as she investigated what *ICH*-2 *T*-1 remained of an old Victorian house torched * by an arsonist.
"I owe that contractor.
I really do," she says *T*-1.
As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house after *PRO*-2 winding up her chores there, the house begins *-1 to creak and sway.
The ground *ICH*-1 shakes underneath her.
It is an aftershock, one of about 2,000 since the earthquake, and it makes her uneasy.
The next day, as she prepares a $10,000 *U* check for the Hammacks, which *T*-1 will cover the cost of *PRO* demolishing the house and clearing away the debris, she jumps at the slightest noise.
On further reflection, she admits that *PRO*-1 venturing inside the Hammacks' house the previous day wasn't "such a great idea."
During her second meeting with the Hammacks, Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers *T*-1.
They would like *PRO*-1 to retrieve some appliances on the second floor, but wonder if it *EXP*-2's safe *PRO* to venture inside.
Ms. Johnson tells them that, if the appliances can't be salvaged *-1, their policy covers the replacement cost.
Mr. Hammack is eager *PRO*-3 to know what Aetna will pay *T*-2 for the house, which *T*-1 has *-4 to come down.
"When will I get that check for a million dollars *T*-1?" he jokes *T*-2.
The adjuster hadn't completed all the calculations, but says: "We're talking policy limits."
In this case, that's about $250,000 *U*.
It *EXP*-1 suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack that *PRO* rebuilding the house in Los Gatos, an affluent community in Santa Clara County, may cost more than Aetna's policy will pay *?*.
"We can lose money on this," he says *T*-1.
"And you didn't want me to buy earthquake insurance," says *T*-2 Mrs. Hammack, *PRO*-1 reaching across the table and gently tapping his hand.
Earthquake insurance costs about $2 to $4 *U* annually for every $1,000 *U* of value, and high deductibles mean 0 it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe *T*-1.
So, many Californians believe 0 they can get by without it.
Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption.
"I always knew that the ` Big One' was coming, but not during my lifetime," she says *T*-1.
Now she says 0 she's thinking of *PRO*-1 contacting her own insurance agent.
For Ms. Johnson, *PRO* dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience.
She lives in Oakland, a community hit * hard by the earthquake.
She didn't have hot water for five days.
The apartment 0 she shares *T*-2 with a 12 - year - old daughter and her sister was rattled *-1, books and crystal hit the floor, but nothing was severely damaged.
Her sister, Cynthia, wishes 0 Toni had a different job.
"We worry about her out there," Cynthia says *T*-1.
Last Sunday, Ms. Johnson finally got a chance *PRO*-1 to water her plants, but stopped abruptly.
"I realized 0 I couldn't waste this water when there are people in Watsonville who *T*-1 don't have fresh water 0 *PRO* to drink *T*-2 *T*-3."
She hasn't played any music since the earthquake hit, out of respect for those who *T*-1 died on Interstate 880 where the roadway collapsed *T*-2.
September sales at major Japanese retail stores rose 9.4% from a year earlier to 1.388 trillion yen ($9.81 billion *U*), *PRO* marking the fifth - consecutive monthly increase, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced 0 *T*-1.
According to the ministry, retail sales at major department stores were up 12% to 745.7 billion yen, while sales at supermarkets rose 6.7% to 642 billion yen.
September's growth followed a 8.7% rise in July and an 8% increase in August, *PRO* showing continued expansion at high year - on - year levels.
A ministry official said 0 the growth leads to the conclusion 0 the adverse effects of a consumption tax introduced * in April have diminished.
Calgene Inc. and Gustafson Inc. said 0 they plan a joint project 0 *T*-1 to develop biological products 0 *T*-2 to control such plant diseases as aflatoxin, a potent cancer - causing agent.
Under the plan, the companies will use Calgene's patented technology *PRO*-1 to encapsulate microbes such as Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium, *PRO*-2 to enhance their biological activity against plant diseases.
Calgene, an agricultural biotechnology concern, said 0 initial work will concentrate on a proprietary strain of Bacillus subtilis which *T*-1 has shown promise for *PRO* controlling aflatoxin.
The strain was discovered *-1 by Morinaga & Co. and licensed *-1 to Gustafson, a unit of Uniroyal Chemical Co.
Aflatoxin is released *-1 by molds during grain and seed storage.
The recent appearance of aflatoxin in such foods as corn and peanut butter has sparked public concern and consumer scrutiny of food handling and storage procedures.
Y.J. Park and her family scrimped for four years *PRO*-2 to buy a tiny apartment here, but found that the closer they got *-3 to saving the $40,000 *U* 0 they originally needed *T*-1, the more the price rose.
By this month, it had more than doubled.
Now the 33 - year - old housewife, whose husband *T*-1 earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics, is saving harder than ever.
"I am determined *PRO*-1 to get an apartment in three years," she says *T*-2.
"It's all 0 I think about *T*-1 or talk about *T*-1."
For the Parks and millions of other young Koreans, the long - cherished dream of home ownership has become a cruel illusion.
For the government, it has become a highly volatile political issue.
Last May, a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem.
During the past 15 years, the report showed 0 *?*, housing prices increased nearly fivefold.
The report laid the blame on speculators, who it said 0 *T*-1 had pushed land prices up ninefold.
The panel found that since 1987, real - estate prices rose nearly 50% in a speculative fever fueled * by economic prosperity, the 1988 Seoul Olympics and the government's pledge *PRO* to rapidly develop Korea's southwest.
The result is that those rich enough *PRO* to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially.
For those with no holdings, the prospects of *PRO* buying a home are ever slimmer.
In 1987, a quarter of the population owned 91% of the nation's 71,895 square kilometers of private land, the report said 0 *?*, and 10% of the population owned 65% of the land devoted * to housing.
Meanwhile, the government's Land Bureau reports that only about a third of Korean families own their own homes.
Rents have soared along with house prices.
Former National Assemblyman Hong Sa - Duk, now a radio commentator, says 0 the problem is intolerable for many people.
"I'm afraid of a popular revolt if this situation isn't corrected *-2," he adds *T*-1.
In fact, during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the Land Bureau is housed *-1 *T*-2, and at the National Assembly, demanding 0 the government put a stop to real - estate speculation.
President Roh Tae Woo's administration has been studying the real - estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land redistribution.
Last week, the government took three bills to the National Assembly.
The proposed legislation is aimed *-1 at *PRO* rectifying some of the inequities in the current land - ownership system.
Highlights of the bills, as *PRO* currently framed *-2, are:--A restriction on the amount of real estate 0 one family can own *T*-1, to 660 square meters in the nation's six largest cities, but more in smaller cities and rural areas.
The government will penalize offenders, but won't confiscate property.
-- A tax of between 3% and 6% *U* on property holdings that *T*-1 exceed the governmentset ceiling.
-- Taxes of between 15% and 50% *U* a year on "excessive" profits from the resale of property, or the sale of idle land to the government.
The government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized * for other similar - sized properties in an area.
-- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect.
The administration says 0 the measures would stem rampant property speculation, free more land for the government's ambitious housing - construction program, designed *PRO* to build two million apartments by 1992--and, perhaps, boost the popular standing of President Roh.
But opposition legislators and others calling for help for South Korea's renters say 0 the proposed changes don't go far enough *PRO*-2 to make it *EXP*-1 possible for ordinary people to buy a home.
Some want lower limits on house sizes; others insist on progressively higher taxation for larger homes and lots.
The Citizens Coalition for Economic Justice, a public - interest group leading the charge for radical reform, wants restrictions on landholdings, high taxation of capital gains, and drastic revamping of the value - assessment system on which property taxes are based *-1 *T*-2.
But others, large landowners, real - estate developers and business leaders, say 0 the government's proposals are intolerable.
*PRO*-1 Led *-2 by the Federation of Korean Industries, the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties.
Government officials who *T*-1 are urging real - estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure.
"There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing *T*-2," says *T*-3 Lee Kyu Hwang, director of the government's Land Bureau, which *T*-1 drafted the bills.
But, he adds 0 *?*, the constitution empowers the government to impose some controls, *PRO*-2 to mitigate the shortage of land.
The land available for housing construction stands at about 46.2 square meters a person--18% lower than in Taiwan and only about half that of Japan.
Mr. Lee estimates that about 10,000 property speculators are operating in South Korea.
The chief culprits, he says 0 *?*, are big companies and business groups that *T*-1 buy huge amounts of land "not for their corporate use, but for resale at huge profit."
One research institute calculated that as much as 67% of corporate - owned land is held *-1 by 403 companies--and that as little as 1.5% of that is used *-2 for business.
The government's Office of Bank Supervision and Examination told the National Assembly this month that in the first half of 1989, the nation's 30 largest business groups bought real estate valued * at $1.5 billion *U*.
The Ministry of Finance, as a result, has proposed a series of measures that *T*-1 would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed * at individuals.
Under those measures, financial institutions would be restricted *-1 from *PRO*-1 owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations.
Banks, investment and credit firms would be permitted *-1 *PRO*-2 to own land equivalent in value to 50% of their capital--currently the proportion is 75%.
The maximum allowable property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced *-1 to 10% of their total asset value, down from 15% currently.
But Mrs. Park acknowledges that even if the policies work *PRO*-1 to slow or stop speculation, apartment prices are unlikely *-2 to go down.
At best, she realizes 0 *?*, they will rise more slowly--more slowly, she hopes 0 *?*, than her family's income.
Shell Canada Ltd. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to build a lubricants blending and packaging plant at Brockville, Ontario, with start - up scheduled *-2 for 1992.
A spokesman said 0 the plant, which *T*-1 will replace older lubricant and grease manufacturing plants in Montreal and Toronto, will cost about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$42.5 million *U*) *PRO* to build *?*.
Brockville is about 100 miles east of Toronto.
Shell Canada, an oil and gas producer and marketer, is a unit of Royal Dutch / Shell Group, an Anglo - Dutch concern.
Iverson Technology Corp. was one of the fastest - growing small companies in America--until last year.
The McLean, Va., company modifies computers *PRO* to keep sensitive military data *PRO*-1 out of unfriendly hands.
From 1984 to 1987, its earnings soared six-fold, to $3.8 million *U*, on a seven-fold increase in revenue, to $44.1 million *U*.
But in 1988, it ran into a buzz saw: a Defense Department spending freeze.
Iverson's earnings plunged 70% to $1.2 million *U*.
The troubles continued in this year's first half, when profit plunged 81% to $302,000 *U* *T*-1.
Iverson Technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged * by the slowdown in defense spending.
Unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base 0 *PRO* to weather the downturn easily *T*-1, these companies are suffering big drops in business as once - lucrative specialty niches in the massive military market erode or even disappear.
Companies that *T*-1 only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling *PRO*-2 to survive.
As their varied strategies suggest, there is more than one way 0 *PRO* to respond to a disaster *T*-1--though it's too soon *PRO* to tell whether the changes will pay off.
For many companies, the instinctive first response is *PRO* to cut costs.
Others are trying *PRO*-1 to find specialty defense work spared * by the slowdown or new niches created * by budget - cutting.
More venturesome businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields.
ERC International Inc., which *T*-1 provides professional and technical services to the military, is refining its defense niche, not retreating from it.
After *PRO*-1 quadrupling annual earnings over four years to $6.8 million *U* in 1988, the Fairfax, Va., company, posted a 23% drop in earnings for this year's first half.
In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top Defense Department priority, ERC last year acquired W.J. Schafer Associates, a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative.
While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded W.J. Schafer two contracts totaling $13.4 million *U*, ERC's chairman and founder, Jack Aalseth, says 0 he bought the company "more for its technology than its customer."
UNC Inc., an Annapolis, Md., contractor that *T*-1 earned $23.8 million *U* on revenue of $400.4 million *U* in 1988, has gone even further in *PRO* realigning its military business.
As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled, three years of steady growth ended with a 69% drop in income in this year's first half.
The company hit on a new strategy: If the Defense Department is so intent on *PRO* saving money, why not *PRO* make money off that trend?
Among the company's current efforts: *PRO* repairing old parts at 25% of the cost of *PRO* replacing them.
UNC also is selling new parts, if *PRO* needed *-1, directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor.
At as little as one - third of the government's cost, the company is running a program 0 *T*-1 to train Army helicopter pilots.
It is also taking over the maintenance of certain Navy aircraft with 40% fewer people than the military used.
In another approach, tiny Iverson Technology is trying *PRO*-1 to resume its growth by *PRO*-2 braving the new world of commercial products.
Donald Iverson, chairman, says 0 he hopes 0 the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets.
For now, he says 0 *?*, "we're looking at *PRO* buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal - computer business."
Earlier this month, Mr. Iverson agreed *PRO*-1 to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed * by Visher Systems Inc., Salt Lake City.
The product automates an array of functions performed * at small *RNR*-1 to medium *RNR*-1 - size printing companies.
Mr. Iverson says 0 there are 5,000 potential customers for the software in the Washington, D.C., area alone.
QuesTech Inc., Falls Church, Va., also has acquired some companies outside the military market.
Moreover, it's trying *PRO*-1 to transfer its skill at *PRO* designing military equipment to commercial ventures.
A partnership with a Williamsburg, Va., unit of Shell Oil Co. recently patented a process for *PRO* producing plastic food containers that *T*-1 won't melt in microwave ovens.
"We're trying *PRO*-1 to take the imagination and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry," says *T*-2 Vincent Salvatori, QuesTech's chief executive.
"It is an effort *PRO* to branch out from the government, which *T*-1 is very difficult for a defense contractor."
Mr. Salvatori should know.
Instead of *PRO*-2 helping his company in the defense spending slowdown, Dynamic Engineering Inc., a troubled subsidiary that *T*-1 makes wind tunnels for the space industry, contributed to much of QuesTech's $3.3 million *U* loss on $55.6 million *U* in revenue last year.
In January, Mr. Salvatori sold the unit.
"It was our first acquisition," he says *?*, "and it was a mistake."
Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best.
Telos Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., provider of software - development and hardware - maintenance services to the military, enjoyed steady growth until this year.
Following a tripling of earnings, to $3.9 million *U*, on a doubling of revenue, to $116 million *U*, over four years, earnings in the company's fiscal first quarter, which *T*-1 ended June 30, plunged 90% to $45,000 *U*.
A one - time write - off for *PRO* booking nonexistent revenue was partly *PRO* to blame *-1, but so were *T*-2 lower profits from a stingier contract with the Army and delays in *PRO* getting paid.
Telos responded by *PRO*-1 combining three of its five divisions *PRO*-2 to reduce expenses and "bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities," says *T*-3 Lin Conger, Telos chairman and controlling shareholder.
"It *EXP*-1's evident 0 we're entering a more competitive era," he says *T*-2.
TransTechnology Corp., a Sherman Oaks, Calif., defense contractor that *T*-1 earned $9.2 million *U* on revenue of $235.2 million *U* in 1988, provides a more dramatic example of cost - cutting.
The company not only merged three military - electronics manufacturing operations, but also closed an unrelated plant that *T*-1 makes ordnance devices used * in fighter planes and missiles.
The closing contributed to a $3.4 million *U* loss in the fiscal first quarter ended * July 31--its first quarterly loss since 1974.
"Our ordnance business has been hurt *-1 very badly by the slowdown," says *T*-2 Arch Scurlock, TransTechnology's chairman.
"I wouldn't say 0 we're out of the business.
But we're not making as many {pyrotechnic devices} as we used to *?*.
Joe Frank Sanderson Jr. was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive officer of this poultry producer.
Joe Frank Sanderson, who *T*-1 is currently chairman, chief executive and treasurer, will remain chairman.
The current president and chief operating officer, J. Odell Johnson, was elected *-1 to the new position of vice chairman of the board.
Energetic and concrete action has been taken *-1 in Colombia during the past 60 days against the mafiosi of the drug trade, but it has not been sufficiently effective, because, unfortunately, it came too late.
Ten years ago, the newspaper El Espectador, of which my brother Guillermo was editor *T*-1, began warning of the rise of the drug mafias and of their leaders' aspirations *PRO* to control Colombian politics, especially the Congress.
Then, when it *EXP*-1 would have been easier *PRO* to resist them *T*-4, nothing was done *-2 and my brother was murdered *-3 by the drug mafias three years ago.
The most ruthless dictatorships have not censored their press more brutally than the drug mafias censor Colombia's.
The censorship is enforced *-1 through terrorism and assassination.
In the past 10 years about 50 journalists have been silenced *-1 forever, murdered *-1.
Within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the El Espectador in Bogota, *PRO*-1 destroying a major part of its installations and equipment.
And only last week the newspaper Vanguardia Liberal in the city of Bucaramanga was bombed *-1, and its installations destroyed *-2.
Journalists and their families are constantly threatened *-1 as are the newspaper distribution outlets *?*.
Distribution centers are bombed *-1, and advertisers are intimidated *-2.
Censorship is imposed *-1 by terrorism.
If the Colombian media accept this new and hideous censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published * in the free world.
The solidarity of the uncensored media world - wide against drug terrorism is the only way 0 press freedom can survive *T*-1.
The American people and their government also woke up too late to the menace 0 drugs posed *T*-1 to the moral structure of their country.
Even now, the American attack upon this tremendous problem is timid in relation to the magnitude of the threat.
I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered *-1 drugs three times in the few blocks' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
Colombia alone--its government, its people, its newspapers--does not have the capacity 0 *PRO* to fight this battle successfully *T*-1.
All drug - consuming countries must jointly decide *PRO*-1 to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs.
The U.S., as the major drug consumer, should lead this joint effort.
Reduction, if not the total cessation, of drug consumption is the requirement for victory.
Much *ICH*-3 is being done *-1 in Colombia 0 *T*-2 to fight the drug cartel mafia.
Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided *-1 by the military authorities, and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized *-2.
More than 300 planes and helicopters have been impounded *-1 at airports, and a large number of vehicles and launches has been confiscated *-2.
The military has also captured enormous arsenals of powerful and sophisticated weapons, explosives and other war - like materiel.
Much has been accomplished *-1 and public opinion decisively supports the government and the army--but, on the other hand, none of the key drug barons have been captured *-2.
There has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the Colombian economy is sustained *-1 by the laundering of drug money.
In my opinion, this is not true.
Laundered drug money has served *PRO*-2 only to increase, unrealistically, the price of real estate, *PRO* creating serious problems for low - income people who *T*-1 aspire *PRO*-3 to own their own homes.
Drug money has also gone *PRO*-2 to buy expensive cars, airplanes, launches and nightclubs where drugs are consumed *-1 *T*-3.
But most of the drug money is kept *-1 in investments and in financial institutions outside Colombia.
In fact, the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle.
What *T*-1 is of much more importance to the Colombian economy than the supposed benefits of laundered drug money is higher prices for Colombia's legitimate products.
The price of coffee has gone down almost 45% since the beginning of the year, to the lowest level (after inflation) since the Great Depression.
Market conditions point to even lower prices next year.
The 27 - year - old coffee cartel had *-1 to be formally dissolved *-2 this summer.
As a result, Colombia will earn $500 million *U* less from its coffee this year than last.
Our coffee growers face reductions in their income, and this tempts them to contemplate *PRO*-1 substituting coca crops for coffee.
U.S. interests occasionally try *PRO*-1 to impose barriers to the import of another important Colombian export--cut flowers--into the American market.
A just price and an open market for what Colombian produces and exports *T*-1 should be the policy of the U.S. .
I take advantage of this opportunity given * to me by The Wall Street Journal *PRO*-1 to make a plea *ICH*-2 to the millions of readers of this newspaper, *PRO* to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs.
Each gram of cocaine consumed * is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who *T*-1 fight this terrible scourge.
A crusade of NO to the consumption of drugs is imperative.
Mr. Cano is president of El Espectador, a newspaper founded * by his grandfather.
Carl E. Pissocra, president and chief executive officer of Bank One, Dover, has been named *-1 *PRO*-2 regional president, a new post at the bank - holding company.
Mr. Pissocra, 56 years old, will be responsible for the company's 10 banks in the Eastern region.
Dan J. Hartwell, 41, executive vice president of Bank One, Dover, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive of the Dover bank, *PRO*-1 succeeding Mr. Pissocra.
No one was named *PRO*-1 *PRO*-2 to succeed Mr. Hartwell.
Canadian production of market pulp rose 1% in September from a year earlier as the industry operated at 87% of capacity.
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said 0 Canadian mills produced 532,000 metric tons of market pulp in September, compared with 527,000 metric tons a year earlier.
Market pulp is wood pulp sold * on the open market to producers of paper and other products.
The statistics exclude pulp consumed * at the producing mill or shipped * to another mill that *T*-1 is affiliated *-2 with the producing mill.
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
The September 87% operating rate compared with a rate of 101% in August but was unchanged from a year earlier.
In the first nine months of this year output was 5,377,000 metric tons, down from 5,441,000 metric tons a year earlier.
Contrary to what *T*-3 might be expected *-1 based on the headline on John R. Dorfman's recent Money Matters article ("Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts *T*-4" Oct. 3), I was able *PRO*-5 to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught *-2 *T*-6 in the classroom.
In particular, I do not find the fact that your group of pros' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency.
Mr. Dorfman states that an investor who *T*-1 invested $100,000 *U* a year ago in the first four stocks selected * by your pros and then sold those one month later, *PRO*-2 purchasing the four new pro picks, and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $166,537 *U*, excluding account dividends, taxes and commissions.
In contrast, an investor holding the Dow Jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $127,446 *U*.
Accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation.
Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments.
Thus, rather than *PRO* seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as *PRO* being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for *PRO* taking on added risk.
I believe 0 the risk for each individual stock selected * by your pros is very large.
If you asked me *PRO*-1 to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk, as I am sure 0 your pros do *?*.
Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated *-1 for *PRO* taking on this added risk.
Moreover, your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains 0 *T*-2 to be had *-1 in *PRO* reducing risk by *PRO* diversifying his portfolio.
A four - stock portfolio is still exposed *-1 to a great deal of unnecessary risk.
This means 0 the returns can vary a great deal.
Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $112,383 *U* by *PRO* randomly selecting four new stocks 0 *T*-2 to be held *-1 in a portfolio each month *T*-3.
Scott E. Hein Texas Tech University Lubbock, Texas Your Investment Dartboard article misses the target.
The fact that stock pickers have bested a randomly selected portfolio in eight of 12 months has no bearing on the efficient - market theory.
What *T*-1 matters is that the stocks recommended * by your pros tend *-2 to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio.
For example, your pickers' recommendations for the coming month are, on average, 22.5% riskier than *PRO* holding the market portfolio according to Value Line's Beta estimates.
James Morgan's pick for October--Dynascan--is a substantial 35% riskier than the market portfolio; his lauded Thermo Electron pick is 40% riskier.

Ground zero of the HUD scandal is the Secretary's "discretionary fund," a honey pot used * *PRO* to fund projects that *T*-1 weren't approved *-2 through normal HUD channels.
Jack Kemp wants *PRO*-1 to abolish it.
Instead, Congress's idea of reform is *PRO* to increase this slush fund by $28.4 million *U*.
And transfer control of much of it to Capitol Hill.
The HUD scandals will simply continue, but under new mismanagement.
After one of the most amazing debates 0 we've ever seen *T*-2 on the cable channel C - SPAN, the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday *PRO*-3 to order $28.4 million *U* in spending for a New Jersey arts center, a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that *T*-1 was supposed *-4 to have been so abused *-5 during Sam Pierce's tenure.
HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects, none of the others has been approved *-1 and not a single congressional hearing *ICH*-3 has been held *-2 on any of them.
However, four are in the Michigan district of Rep. Bob Traxler, the chairman of the House subcommittee that *T*-1 writes the HUD spending bill.
Of course, this kind of blatant congressional pork - barreling is called *-1 *PRO*-3 "constituent service" by Members, while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at HUD is labeled *-2 "*PRO*-4 influence peddling."
Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from HUD projects.
They merely collect campaign contributions from developers that *T*-1 help *PRO*-2 keep them *PRO*-3 in office.
The 40 pet projects were discovered *-1 *PRO*-3 buried *-5 in the appropriations bill for HUD and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that *T*-2 was called *-4 *PRO* to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.
Conference committees are breeding grounds for mischief.
They are often closed *-2 to the public and no minutes are taken *-1.
Members find it *EXP*-1 easy *PRO* to doctor legislation by *PRO* slipping in special provisions that *T*-2 could never survive in the cold light of day.
In this case, the Members outdid themselves.
They transferred some $28 million *U* from the Community Development Block Grant program designated * largely for low - and moderate - income projects and funneled it into such items as:--$1.2 million *U* for a performing - arts center in Newark,--$1.3 million *U* for "job retention" in Hawaiian sugar mills .--$400,000 *U* for a collapsing utility tunnel in Salisbury,--$500,000 *U* for "equipment and landscaping 0 *T*-1 to deter crime and aid police surveillance" at a Michigan park .--$450,000 *U* for "integrated urban data based * in seven cities ." No other details .--$390,000 *U* for a library and recreation center at Mackinac Island, Mich.
Rep. Traxler recently purchased an unimproved building lot on the island.
SYDNEY - Qintex Australia Ltd., under pressure from bank lenders, has called in accounting firm Peat Marwick Hungerfords *PRO*-1 to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company.
Analysts said 0 the move could presage even harsher action by the banks.
But any move by the banks 0 *T*-1 to take over Qintex Australia's management could threaten its ability *PRO* to operate its national television network under Australian broadcast license rules.
That, in turn, could substantially reduce the value of the television assets.
The appointment of Peat Marwick, which *T*-1 has a unit that *T*-2 specializes in *PRO* advising troubled companies, came about as a result of a round of meetings held * by Qintex Australia Chairman Christopher Skase with bank creditors.
Yesterday, Mr. Skase said 0 the company is "solvent and with the continued support of its bankers is able *PRO*-1 to meet its financial commitments."
Qintex Australia is a unit of Qintex Ltd.
The Qintex group's problems began in earnest in March, when Mr. Skase agreed *PRO*-1 to buy MGM / UA Communications Co *T*-2.
But the transaction faltered in September, when Qintex Australia was forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to increase its offer to US$1.5 billion *U* following a counterbid from Rupert Murdoch *T*-2; the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month.
Qintex Australia owes creditors around A$1.2 billion *U*.
Last Friday, Qintex Entertainment Inc., its 43% - owned U.S. TV production and distribution affiliate, filed for Chapter 11 protection.
On the hungry streets of Naguib Mahfouz's Cairo, life is nasty, brutish and wickedly entertaining.
Zaita the "cripple - maker" rearranges the limbs of aspiring beggars--and takes a cut of every cent 0 they cadge *T*-1.
Hassan Kamel Ali is a card shark and dope dealer who *T*-1 has a simple creed: "I live in this world, *PRO*-2 assuming that there is no morality, God or police."
For the killer and thief, Said Mahran, fame flows from the barrel of a gun.
"One man said 0 you act as a stimulant," a prostitute tells him *?*, "a diversion *PRO* to relieve people's boredom."
Mr. Mahfouz's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who *T*-1 look to God, not crime, for their salvation.
But it is his portrait of Cairo low - life--of charlatans and opium addicts, of streets filled * with "dust, vegetable litter, and animal dung"--that *T*-1 made his reputation, and won him the Nobel Prize in 1988.
Three novels, "The Beginning and the End" (412 pages, $19.95 *U*), "The Thief and the Dogs" (158 pages, $16.95 *U*), and "Wedding Song" (174 pages, $16.95 *U*), recently published * by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77 - year - old Mr. Mahfouz's talent.
But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30 - odd novels *T*-1 span five decades and include work of social realism, protest and allegory.
They also chart the evolution of a city that *T*-1 has grown tenfold in the author's lifetime, from a colonial outpost of fez - wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse.
"Soon it'll be so crowded," a narrator complains *?*, "that people will start *-2 eating each other."
"The Beginning and the End," easily the best of the three, belongs to Mr. Mahfouz's "realistic" period and it is the one for which he is most renowned *T*-1.
*PRO*-3 Published *-2 in 1949, it follows the decline of a Cairo family with the saga - like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare *T*-1 to Dickens, Balzac and Galsworthy.
A minor bureaucrat dies suddenly, *PRO*-1 dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace.
His daughter turns to dressmaking, then to *PRO* peddling herself for a few piasters.
One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed, while another helps *PRO* support the family with money siphoned * from crime.
The real tragedy, though, lies not in the family's circumstances but in its concern for appearances.
*PRO* Mourning for the father is overshadowed *-2 by the shame of *PRO* burying him in a pauper's grave.
The family moves to another house at night *PRO*-1 to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors.
And the successful son wishes his embarrassing siblings dead.
As a critique of middle - class mores, the story is heavy - handed.
But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz.
We see, smell and hear slums filled * with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed * with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street."
And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed * for his head - butting fights, his whoring and his hashish.
"` God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings,' he tells his worried mother *T*-1."
Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does *T*-1 almost everyone else in the book.
If the setting is exotic, the prose is closer to Balzac's "Pere Goriot" than it is *?* to "Arabian Nights."
Mr. Mahfouz began *-1 writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic *T*-2, and he modeled his work on Western classics.
In one sense, this limits him; unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who *T*-2 has a distinctive Latin voice, Mr. Mahfouz's style offers little that *T*-3 can be labeled *-1 *PRO*-4 "Egyptian."
But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible, as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens's London or Dostoevski's St. Petersburg.
"The Thief and the Dogs," written * in 1961, is a taut, psychological drama, reminiscent of "Crime and Punishment."
Its antihero, Said Mahran, is an Egyptian Raskolnikov who *T*-1 seeks nobility in robbing and killing.
"I am the hope and the dream, the redemption of cowards," he says *T*-1 in one of many interior monologues.
Later, he recalls the words of his Marxist mentor: "The people! Theft! The holy fire!"
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule *T*-1 replaced the monarchy overthrown * in 1952.
By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has *?* in Said.
His giddy dream of *PRO* redeeming a life of "badly aimed bullets" by *PRO*-2 punishing the "real robbers"--the rich "dogs" who *T*-1 prey on the poor--leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own.
Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray.
Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism: Said has left his jail cell only *PRO*-1 to enter the larger prison of Cairo society.
While the theme is compelling, the plot and characters are not *?*.
We never care about Said or the "hypocrites" 0 he hunts *T*-1.
"The Thief and the Dogs" is a pioneering work, the first stream - of - consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely *-1 to disappoint Western readers.
The 1981 novel "Wedding Song" also is experimental, and another badly aimed bullet.
The story of a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first - person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury."
But the device obscures more than it illuminates.
Buried in the work is *T*-1 a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world.
But again, the themes get tangled *-1 in Mr. Mahfouz's elliptical storytelling.
The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world.
Mr. Mahfouz has been pilloried and censored *-1 for *PRO*-1 questioning Islam and advocating peace with Israel.
*PRO* Veiling his message has helped him *PRO*-1 endure.
Art, says 0 *?* the playwright in "Wedding Song," is "the surrogate for the action that an idealist like me is unable *PRO*-3 to take *T*-2."
"Wedding Song" gives glimpses of a Cairo that *T*-1 has become so much harsher since his youth, when, as he once said *T*-2, "the poorest person was able *PRO*-3 to find his daily bread and without great difficulty *T*-4."
The clutter of the 1940s remains, but its color has drained away, and the will *PRO* to overcome has been defeated *-1.
Cars can't move because of overflowing sewers.
Characters complain ceaselessly about food queues, prices and corruption.
And the ubiquitous opium addict is now a cynical and selfish man who *T*-1 gripes: "Only government ministers can afford it these days!"
*PRO*-1 Having lost their faith in God, in social reform and in opium, Cairenes are left *-1 with nothing but their sense of humor.

W.R. Grace & Co. said 0 it formed a new horticultural - products company by *PRO* combining its soil - nutrients and fertilizers business with Sierra Chemical Co., Milpitas, Calif.
Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals that *T*-1 already owned about 30% of closely held Sierra, said 0 it owns a 49% stake in the new company.
Grace said 0 it didn't invest any additional capital in the venture, which *T*-2 will be known *-1 as Grace - Sierra Horticultural Products Co.
The business is expected *-1 to have sales of about $100 million *U* in 1990, Grace said 0 *T*-2.
The new company's product lines will be aimed *-1 at nurseries, greenhouses and the lawn and garden industry.
Furukawa Electric Co., one of Japan's leading electric wire and cable manufacturers, said 0 unconsolidated pretax profit in the fiscal first half ended * Sept. 30 fell 5.3% to 6.11 billion yen ($43.1 million *U*) from 6.45 billion yen a year earlier.
Sales increased 11.9% to 279.39 billion yen from 249.68 billion yen.
Net fell 1% to 3.23 billion yen from 3.26 billion yen.
Pershare net fell to 4.97 yen from 5.40 yen.
The growing sales sustained * by domestic demand failed *-2 to counter rising material metal costs and declining profitability in overseas construction, Furukawa said 0 *T*-1.
Rolled copper product sales were major contributors to overall sales growth.
Sales by category rose 24% to 35.23 billion yen, *PRO* reflecting increased production in automobile, airconditioner and electric machine industries, which *T*-1 are major users of wire and cable products.
Sales for electric wires and cables rose 13.2% to 153.93 billion yen.

When the going gets tough *T*-2, it *EXP*-1's tough *PRO* to trade stocks in continental Europe.
That's the troubling conclusion reached * by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week's global market turbulence.
They say 0 the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way 0 many European exchanges trade stocks *T*-1.
The weaknesses of Continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded * on London's stock exchange, which *T*-1 quotes firm trading prices for about 350 blue - chip issues from 12 major countries.
"I'm not saying 0 London covered itself in glory, but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe's weaknesses," says *T*-2 Stewart Gilchrist, a director of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow, Scotland, which *T*-1 manages about #6 billion *U* ($9.63 billion *U*) in institutional money.
He says 0 the problems on European exchanges included market - system breakdowns, delayed execution of *PRO* buy and sell orders and trading suspensions.
"The events strengthen London's hand in *PRO* becoming the center for *PRO* trading European stocks," Mr. Gilchrist says *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Unable *PRO*-2 to unload a large block of a French blue - chip company's shares in Paris for two days last week, a frustrated Scottish Amicable fund manager finally tossed down her phone in disgust and called James Capel & Co., a London brokerage firm.
The firm did the trade in seconds on the London stock exchange's SEAQ automated - quotation system.
On so - called Manic Monday, Oct. 16, stock prices plunged across Europe and trading problems erupted.
London had some problems, too.
The London exchange's electronic price - reporting system provided only indicative, or non-firm, prices for about 40 minutes on Manic Monday.
Some dealers say 0 other traders weren't picking up their phones.
But London's problems were nothing compared with the Continent's.
In Brussels, which *T*-1 recently spent millions of dollars on a computer - assisted trading system, disgusted traders watched helplessly as a software failure before opening on Manic Monday prevented trading for two days.
For 48 hours, no one had any idea precisely how much his securities were worth *T*-1.
By Wednesday, frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by *PRO* using the time - honored method of *PRO* quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard.
The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted *-2 on Tuesday of this week, with the aid of Toronto Stock Exchange officials who *T*-1 developed the system.
In Frankfurt, which *T*-1 only has a two - hour daily stock - trading session even in the best of times, stocks didn't open for the first 45 minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame *T*-2 on a wave of sell orders from small investors.
As banks processed six - foot telexes of sell orders, the crush led to Manic Monday's worst decline: German stocks ended down 13%.
Exchange officials extended trading hours, 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday, *PRO*-1 to clear up order backlogs.
In France, more than half the top 25 blue - chip stocks--including such giants as BSN and Elf Aquitaine--didn't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day, traders say 0 *T*-1.
The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders, *PRO* solving an order - imbalance problem.
But by that time, many big institutions had switched business to London.
"Belgium was closed *-1 for two days, France closed for a couple of hours, Germany was stuck *-2.
It was a nightmare," says *T*-1 Susan Noble, an investment manager at Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd.'s International Investment Management unit in London.
"It *EXP*-2's very worrying that these markets can't cope."
On Manic Monday, the volume of German shares traded * in London more than tripled to 2.2 million, and the volume of French shares rose 48%.
(By comparison, German domestic stock volume in Frankfurt only doubled that day.)
The switch to the London market during such turbulent times is significant.
For one thing, the size of the affected market is enormous--the European stock markets account for some 22.5% of global stock market capitalization, with an estimated value of $2.175 trillion *U*, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International.
The Continental markets alone contribute about 14.3% of estimated world market capitalization of $9.671 trillion *U*.
Though the widely traded shares that *T*-2 are quoted *-1 in London account for only a small portion of those totals, they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally.
The switch to London underscores the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated * with European Community efforts *PRO* to develop a single market by 1992, European stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity.
Against this backdrop, one thing that *T*-1 doesn't seem *-2 likely *PRO*-3 to result from 1992 is a single European stock market.
Rather, there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that *T*-4 operate in most European financial centers--including European giants such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank, as well as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Japan's Nomura Securities Co.
These firms, which *T*-1 often have acquired a local brokerage firm, are calling the shots when it comes to *PRO* deciding in which market *PRO*-2 to transact a trade *T*-3 *T*-4.
And senior officials of two U.S. securities houses say 0 they switched trades in European stocks to the London market last week when they couldn't unwind positions on the Continent *T*-1.
Meantime, brokers on the Continent are worried *ICH*-1, too, mostly by the potential loss of business.
"I would be much happier if this volume {in German stocks} were in Frankfurt rather than London," says *T*-1 Dieter Bauernfeind, head of international equity sales at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt.
He acknowledges that spreads "were too wide and volumes too light" in the extreme conditions on Manic Monday.
Already the Germans appear *-1 to be acting; at a special meeting on the day of the decline, directors of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange voted *PRO*-2 to extend their trading hours, although they haven't decided when or by how much.
A Frankfurt exchange official, *PRO*-1 acknowledging the brokers' anxieties, says 0 the market still feels 0 it "functioned OK during this crash."
The Dutch, who *T*-2 had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity, say 0 new equipment 0 *T*-4 to solve the problems ought *PRO*-1 to be installed *-3 within a month.
Says *ICH*-1 a spokeswoman for the Brussels Bourse: "Nobody around here will tell you 0 they are happy 0 the system didn't work.
But it's just one of those things that *T*-1 happened.
Investors can be assured *-1 now that this kind of problem can never occur again."
But for others, the pledges echo the promises made * after the 1987 stock crash, when similar problems led many markets *PRO*-3 to develop the new systems that *T*-1 performed so badly last week *T*-2.
"They all said 0 they invested huge amounts of money.
But they either didn't buy the right machines or they wasted it," says *T*-1 Fleming's Ms. Noble.
Trinova Corp. said 0 it will resume *PRO*-1 buying back as many as three million of its common shares under a program announced * two years ago.
Trinova, which *T*-1 had 34.2 million common shares outstanding Sept. 30, had repurchased 29,700 shares since October 1987 before this latest announcement.
The company said 0 it isn't *-1 making a commitment *PRO*-2 to purchase a specific number of shares.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Trinova closed at $32.125 *U*, up 12.5 cents.
It has more drug users than Boston has people.
Thirty - four thousand of its children live in foster homes, while 50,000 residents have no homes at all.
Its tax base is shrinking, a $1 billion *U* budget deficit looms, and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year.
This is New York City.
When the dust and dirt settle in an extra-nasty mayoral race *T*-1, the man most likely *PRO* to gain custody of all this is a career politician named *PRO* *PRO*-2 David Dinkins.
*PRO* Running the nation's largest and most ornery city may be no treat, but at least Mr. Dinkins knows what *PRO*-2 to expect *T*-1 from it.
As the campaign hits the home stretch, however, voters still have very little idea what they can expect *T*-1 from him.
After 25 years in city politics, David Dinkins remains an enigma.
The soft - spoken, silver - haired Manhattan borough president--the first black man 0 *T*-1 to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here--doesn't have a single prominent political enemy.
While he is widely described *-3 as a man with deep convictions, he has few major political programs that he can call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 his own.
*PRO*-2 Asked *-1 about his greatest achievement in public life, he first speaks about the quality of his staff.
Now, as election day nears, even some supporters wonder what he will do *T*-1 if he wins the mayoralty on Nov. 7.
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies, including union leaders and political cronies who *T*-1 may seek a place at the trough.
They wonder whether he has the economic know - how 0 *PRO* to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis *T*-2, and they wonder who *T*-1 will be advising him.
Will he, if he wins, be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies, who *T*-1 advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings, or will he tilt toward the real - estate interests that *T*-2 have funneled money into his campaign?
After his decisive primary victory over Mayor Edward I. Koch in September, Mr. Dinkins coasted, until recently, on a quite - comfortable lead over his Republican opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, the former crime buster who *T*-1 has proved *-2 a something of a bust as a candidate.
But Mr. Dinkins has stumbled in the past two weeks over his campaign's payments to a black activist who *T*-1 is a convicted kidnapper, and over his handling of a stock sale to his son.
Polls also have recorded some slippage in Mr. Dinkins's support among Jewish voters, and citywide projections now put his lead at between four and 20 percentage points.
In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears *-1 quite confident of victory and of his ability *PRO* to handle the mayoralty.
"A lot of people think 0 I will give away the store, but I can assure you 0 I will not *?*," he says *T*-1.
"I am aware 0 we have real budgetary problems."
The city is full of aging bridges, water mains and roadways that *T*-1 are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair.
Renewed efforts *PRO* to fight drugs and crime will be costly.
But city officials say 0 tax revenues are lagging.
And after a decade of explosive job growth on Wall Street, a period of contraction is under way.
Mr. Koch already has announced 0 he will drop 3,200 jobs from the city payroll, but that won't be enough.
New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $1.3 billion *U* budget gap for the city's next fiscal year, a gap that *T*-1 could grow if there is a recession.
If *PRO*-1 elected *-2, Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but *PRO*-1 to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under - serviced neighborhoods.
"He is going *-1 to face a mess," says *T*-2 City Council President Andrew Stein.
"His supporters are not venal, but their solution to everything will be *PRO* to spend more money, and he won't have any money."
By and large, Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore *T*-1.
Instead of *PRO*-1 focusing on the financial future, Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched * by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated * by Mayor Koch.
"The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people," says *T*-1 Meyer Frucher, a real - estate executive and former aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
"It is a *PRO* feel - good candidacy."
No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence.
He is an avuncular figure who *T*-1 remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word 0 *PRO* to say *T*-3 about anybody.
More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger--in which a group of Harlem teens was charged *-1 *T*-2--and the racial murder of a black teen - ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst.
Rather than *PRO*-1 scaring off white voters, as many predicted 0 he would *?*, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for *PRO* having a cool head.
(*PRO* Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority: On humid days this summer, he was known *-1 to change his double - breasted suits as many as four times a day.)
But even in his front - runner campaign, he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say 0 *T*-1 has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president--and might hinder him as mayor.
Over the last few weeks, he has frittered away roughly half of what *T*-1 was once a 33 - point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani.
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled * by his political patron Percy Sutton *T*-2 was allowed *PRO*-3 to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media.
He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke.
His campaign was caught *-1 *PRO*-4 flat - footed amid allegations 0 it paid almost $10,000 *U* for what it said 0 *T*-2 was a "*PRO* get - out - the - vote" effort by black activist Sonny Carson, a convicted kidnapper who later *T*-3 said publicly that he is "anti-white."
Critics have said 0 the payment looked like an attempt *ICH*-3 by the Dinkins camp *PRO* to get Mr. Carson to stop *-1 leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder--protests 0 the campaign may have feared 0 *T*-2 could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate.
Mr. Dinkins also has failed *-1 to allay Jewish voters' fears about his association with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, despite the fact that few local non-Jewish politicians have been as vocal for Jewish causes in the past 20 years as Mr. Dinkins has *?*.
These campaign problems have echoed difficulties 0 Mr. Dinkins has run into *T*-1 before.
A former U.S. Marine, Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics, *PRO*-1 joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s, *PRO*-1 linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel, Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton, and *PRO*-1 getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965.
But his chance *PRO* to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame, a plan boosted * by Mr. Sutton, was squandered *-1 because of Mr. Dinkins's failure *ICH*-2--still largely unexplained--*PRO* to file income tax returns for four years running.
"I always thought of this as a thing that *T*-2 could always be done *-1 tomorrow," he said *T*-3 at the time.
Later, Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols, including then - City Council President Paul O'Dwyer, when they helped him get appointed *-1 *PRO*-3 city clerk, a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city's marriage bureau, among other things *T*-2.
(Mr. O'Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for Mr. Sutton's media company.)
The debt rose further in 1977 when Mr. Sutton resigned his position as Manhattan borough president *PRO*-1 to run for mayor *T*-2.
Mr. Sutton recalls: "When I left *T*-1, I sat down with Charlie {Rangel}, Basil {Paterson} and David, and David said, ` Who *T*-2 will run for borough president?' And I said, ` You will *?*."'
David Garth, Mayor Koch's longtime media adviser, says of Mr. Dinkins, "He really is the personification of the patronage system.
But the guy is so personally decent, 0 people tend *-1 to forget that."
Mr. Dinkins lost twice by wide margins before *PRO* finally getting elected *-1 *PRO*-2 borough president in 1985.
But by most accounts, he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city's Board of Estimate, the body that *T*-1 votes on crucial budget and land - use matters.
Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours *T*-1 as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office *PRO*-2 to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals.
"He taught me how *PRO* to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m. *T*-2, I'll give him that," says *T*-1 Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard.
Often, Mr. Dinkins's procrastination prevented him from *PRO* having a say in the way 0 things turned out *T*-1, critics claim 0 *T*-2.
On the campaign stump, he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member 0 *T*-1 to vote against a controversial real - estate project at Manhattan's Columbus Circle.
But board members say 0 he took so long *PRO*-1 to decide how *PRO* to vote *T*-2 that by the time 0 he decided *T*-3, it was too late *PRO* to try *PRO*-4 to draw other members to his position.
Says *ICH*-1 one city official: "Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal.
He would have got a lot more done *-1 if he made up his mind faster."
One Board member, Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer, was said *-1 to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign.
"I had some problem from time to time on the length of time 0 he would take *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to make up his mind," Mr. Ferrer admits *T*-3, but he maintains that he didn't delay his support of Mr. Dinkins and that he backs the Democratic candidate enthusiastically.
Mr. Dinkins's campaign manager and former chief of staff, Bill Lynch, denies that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long *PRO*-1 to decide important issues.
"We didn't rubber - stamp everything that *T*-1 came to us," Mr. Lynch says *T*-2.
On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign *T*-1, he has run into a familiar kind of trouble.
Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested *PRO* weakening the law forbidding public employees *PRO*-1 to go on strike *T*-2.
He withdrew the remark.
When he later sided with striking hospital workers *T*-1, some allies *ICH*-2 cringed a little more, concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees.
Then, two days before *PRO* receiving an endorsement from environmental groups, Mr. Dinkins promised 0 he would issue a three - year moratorium on construction of garbage - incinerator plants.
That announcement was roundly criticized *-4 by Mayor Koch--who *T*-2 has endorsed Mr. Dinkins--because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $5 million *U* *PRO*-5 planning for an incinerator that *T*-3 would be scrapped *-1 under Mr. Dinkins's proposal.
While his public statements have at times been confusing, Mr. Dinkins's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment.
He favors a form of commercial rent control, which the financial community believes 0 *T*-1 would make it *EXP*-2 more difficult *PRO* to attract investment in the city.
In the midst of a labor shortage, he proposes *PRO* linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of *PRO* hiring New York City residents.
With an untrained local labor pool, many experts believe 0 *?*, that policy could drive businesses from the city.
And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of *PRO* moving employees out of New York City.
Many economic - development officials say 0 the Koch administration's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank jobs from *PRO* moving across the Hudson.
But Mr. Dinkins's economic planks don't seem *-1 to bother the business community, where he draws significant support *T*-2.
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry organization, says 0 Mr. Dinkins's "economic development program is shortsighted, but when it comes down to it *T*-1, he can be reasonable."
Mr. Dinkins's inner circle of advisers appears *-1 to include both ideologues and pragmatists, *PRO* leaving voters with little clue as to who *T*-2 will be more influential.
The key man seems *-1 to be the campaign manager, Mr. Lynch.
A disheveled, roly - poly son of a Long Island potato farmer, Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer who *T*-1 worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson.
But as the Dinkins campaign hit tough times this month, Andrew Cuomo, the politically seasoned son of the New York governor, is also said *-1 to have taken a more active role on strategy.
Another close ally is Ruth Messinger, a Manhattan city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, *T*-1 have made their way into Mr. Dinkins's position papers.
If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins, as some suggest 0 she will *?*, his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor.
But Lincoln Center President Nathan Leventhal, who *T*-1 would head a Dinkins transition team, is more mainstream, as is *?* real - estate executive Anthony Gliedman, another insider.
Mr. Dinkins also has said 0 he would receive economic advice from a board that *T*-1 would include American Express Co. chairman James D. Robinson III, investment banker Felix Rohatyn, leveraged - buy - out specialist Reginald Lewis and attorney Joseph Flom.
Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background.
Names of possible deputies that *T*-1 have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch, former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs. Leventhal and Gliedman.
Then there are Mr. Dinkins's old - time Harlem colleagues, such as U.S. Rep. Rangel, former Deputy Mayor Paterson and Mr. Sutton.
*PRO*-3 Having attained positions of real influence or wealth, these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics; they are less confrontational than the younger, more activist black political community that *T*-2 has been based *-1 largely in Brooklyn.
(Part of Mr. Dinkins's strength is his ability *PRO* to win the support of both the Brooklyn and Harlem factions.)
"We know 0 there are potholes for the city out there," says *T*-1 Mr. Paterson, Mr. Dinkins's former law partner.
"If any of us think 0 we're going *-1 to sidetrack David's determination 0 *T*-2 to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us, we are making a sad mistake."
Adds *ICH*-3 Ms. Messinger, who *T*-1 is expected *-4 to win the borough president's job 0 Mr. Dinkins is vacating *T*-2, "You have *-5 to remember 0 David is a pragmatist."
But Mr. Dinkins's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider's determination *PRO* not to upset the political apple cart.
He is taken *-4 aback in an interview when *PRO* asked *-1 whether, as mayor, he plans on *PRO* reforming the political "fiefdoms" that *T*-2 perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York's school system *T*-3.
"I will sit down and talk some of the problems out, but take on the political system? Uh-uh," he says *T*-1 with a shake of the head.
Despite many doubts about his candidacy, white New Yorkers--who *T*-1 gave Mr. Dinkins 30% of their votes in the primary--aren't expected *-2 to desert in sufficient numbers *PRO* to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani.
The former U.S. attorney, who *T*-1 prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives, has succeeded in *PRO*-2 raising questions about Mr. Dinkins's ethical standards, but so far has failed *-2 to generate excitement about his own candidacy.
As a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, Mr. Giuliani has an inherent handicap.
As a first - time candidate, he has been slow *PRO*-1 to learn the nuances of New York City politicking.
Mr. Giuliani is finding that Mr. Dinkins, in his many years in public life, has built up considerable good will that so far *T*-1 has led many voters *PRO*-2 to overlook certain failings.
"The bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy," says *T*-1 Malcolm Hoenlein, a Jewish community leader.
"In the end, I think 0 David will be judged *-1 for *PRO*-2 being David.
I was impressed *-1 by the perceptiveness of your Sept. 12 story "Rural Enterprise: Tough Row 0 *PRO* To Hoe *T*-2."
We lived in rural areas many years, but now live in St. Louis County, Mo.
This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice - daily journey, I thought of how fortunate it *EXP*-2 was *T*-4 that we made the decision *PRO* to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening *T*-3.
The presence of so many people, cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want *PRO*-1 to live *T*-2.
I thought back to our time in small, sparsely populated communities.
I remembered how hard it *EXP*-5 was *T*-4 for an outsider to become accepted *-3 by long - established, stake - holding residents, and what pitfalls *T*-1 awaited an original thinker in societies that *T*-2 were long accustomed to unchanging, "safe" ways of thought and action.
I remembered *PRO*-3 being fired *-1 at age 44, with five children at home, when my views and actions were deemed *-2 unsettling by a timid, small - town employer *T*-4.
How difficult it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 for a thinking person to live among societies rooted * in the past.
Now, I revel in the freedom, culture, activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic jams and perpetual road - building projects.
Yet when my youngest child died two years ago *T*-1, I buried him in the church cemetery of a small Missouri town.
So after all, even the bitterest critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing yearning for those scarce, rural virtues thought *PRO* to exist amid fields, forests and country lanes.
Ronald Edwin Parsons Ballwin, Mo.
As the Soviet Union grapples with its worsening economy, leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed *PRO* to push the nation much closer to a free - market system.
The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring of the economy.
They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for *PRO* liberalizing the system of *PRO* setting prices, breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state - owned companies out of business.
They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation, and recommend ways 0 *PRO* to soften the social consequences *T*-1.
While many solutions to the nation's economic troubles are being discussed *-1, the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high - level authorship.
Although it was published *-1 *PRO*-3 unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, Soviet sources say 0 the article was written *-2 by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues.
Mr. Abalkin, head of the Academy of Science's Institute of Economics, was recently appointed *-1 *PRO*-2 deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform.
"It's clearly a manifesto for the next stage of perestroika," said *T*-1 one analyst.
The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies.
For example, the proposed overhaul of prices--an extremely sensitive political topic--is far more precise than the vague plans announced * by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped *.
But the proposals also display political savvy, *PRO* couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not *PRO*-3 to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who *T*-2 stand *PRO*-4 to lose out if they are implemented *-1.
*PRO*-3 Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who *T*-1 demand overnight solutions, the article advocates what it calls *T*-2 *PRO*-4 a "radical - moderate approach."
The document is *-2 to be discussed *-1 at a conference of leading economists late this month, and will probably be presented *-2 to the Soviet Parliament for consideration this year.
As policy - makers draw up proposals for the next five - year plan, which *T*-1 starts in 1991, the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what *T*-2 is likely *-3 to be a fierce battle over economic reform.
The authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that "quick and easy paths to success simply don't exist."
Instead, they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995.
Most of the measures would probably only start *-1 to have an effect on beleaguered Soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest.
The key steps advocated * include:--PROPERTY.
Rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned *-1.
The document proposes *PRO*-1 breaking up the monolithic system of state - owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to flourish, *PRO*-2 helped *-3 by tough anti-monopoly legislation.
The economy would be thrown *-2 open to numerous types of ownership *ICH*-3 between now and 1992, including factories leased * by workers or owned * by shareholders, cooperatives and joint ventures.
Some forms of private property would be sanctioned *-1.
Such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries, who now *T*-1 jealously guard their turf and are seen *-2 as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform.
-- FINANCES.
Emergency measures would be introduced *-1 *PRO*-1 to ease the country's financial crisis, notably its $200 billion *U* budget deficit.
By the end of next year, all loss - making state enterprises would be put *-2 out of business or handed *-2 over to workers who *T*-1 would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives.
Similar steps would be taken *-1 *PRO*-1 to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of 1991.
A unified system of taxation should be introduced *-1 rapidly.
*PRO*-2 To mop up some of the 300 billion rubles in circulation, the government should encourage home ownership, including *PRO* issuing bonds that *T*-1 guarantee holders the right *PRO* to purchase an apartment.
-- LABOR.
A genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid, centralized system.
*PRO*-1 Departing from decades of Soviet dogma, the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment.
*PRO*-1 To cushion the blows, the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits.
-- PRICES.
The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled *-1, and free - market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade.
Consumers would still be able *PRO*-2 to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices, but luxury and imported items, including food, would be sold *-1 at market prices.
Wholesale prices would be divided *-1 into three categories: raw materials sold * at fixed prices close to world levels; government - set procurement prices for a small number of key products; and free prices for everything else *PRO* to be determined *-2 by contracts between suppliers and purchasers.
Inflation - adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly don't suffer unduly.
-- FOREIGN TRADE.
The current liberalization and decentralization of foreign trade would be taken *-1 much further.
Soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad.
Foreigners would receive greater incentives *PRO* to invest in the U.S.S.R.
Alongside the current non-convertible ruble, a second currency *ICH*-2 would be introduced *-3 that *T*-1 could be freely exchanged *-4 for dollars and other Western currencies.
A domestic foreign exchange market would be set *-1 up as part of an overhaul of the nation's banking system.
The blueprint is at its vaguest when *PRO* referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that *T*-1 seem likely *PRO*-2 to oppose such sweeping plans: the State Planning Committee, known * as Gosplan, and the State Committee for Material Supply, or Gossnab *T*-3.
But it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes, particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies, take effect.
This is slightly adapted *-1 from remarks Oct. 7 by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz to an alumni gathering at the Stanford Business School, where he has returned to the faculty *T*-2:
I was struck *-1 a couple of years ago by the drug - interdiction effort in the Bahamas.
We had intercepted during the year an estimated $5 billion *U* street value of cocaine.
I don't know how much *T*-1 got through.
Nobody has any credible estimate.
The GNP of the Bahamas is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars.
So you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about *T*-1.
I welcome the emphasis that *T*-2 is now being put *-1 on the drug problem.
The efforts *PRO* to get to the people who *T*-3 are addicted, try *PRO*-1 to rehabilitate them; if they cannot be rehabilitated *-2, at least *PRO* to contain them; *PRO* to educate people, *PRO* to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who *T*-4 are casual users and first users, *PRO* to stop this process among the young--all of these things I think 0 *?* are extremely important.
But, I have *-2 to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely *-1 to work.
The conceptual base--a criminal - justice approach--is the same that I have worked through *T*-1 before, in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs *T*-2.
We designed a comprehensive program, and we worked hard on it.
In the Reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program; we worked very hard on it.
Our international efforts were far greater than ever before.
You're looking at a guy whose motorcade *T*-2 was attacked *-1 in Bolivia by the drug terrorists, so I'm personally a veteran of this war.
What we have *T*-1 before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources plowed * into all of the efforts *PRO* to enforce and control.
These efforts wind up *PRO*-1 creating a market where the price vastly exceeds the cost *T*-2.
With these incentives, demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it.
It seems to me 0 we're not really going *-1 to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it.
Frankly, the only way 0 I can think of *T*-3 0 *PRO* to accomplish this *T*-4 is *PRO* to make it *EXP*-1 possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that *T*-2 approximates their cost.
When you do that *T*-2 you wipe out the criminal incentives, including, I might say, the incentive *ICH*-3 that the drug pushers have *T*-1 *PRO* to go around and get kids addicted, so that they create a market for themselves.
They won't have that incentive because they won't have that market.
So I think 0 the conceptual base needs *-2 to be thought *-1 out in a different way.
If I am catching your attention, then *PRO* read a bold and informative article in this September's issue of Science by Ethan Nadelmann on this subject.
We need *-1 at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs.
I find it *EXP*-2 very difficult *PRO* to say that.
Sometimes at a reception or cocktail party I advance these views and people head for somebody else.
They don't even want *PRO*-1 to talk to you.
I know that I'm shouting into the breeze here as far as what we're doing *T*-1 now.
But I feel that if somebody doesn't get up and start *-1 talking about this now, the next time around, when we have the next iteration of these programs *T*-2, it *EXP*-3 will still be true that everyone is scared *PRO*-4 to talk about it.
No politician wants *PRO*-2 to say what I just said *T*-1, not for a minute.
The Justice Department said 0 it is seeking *PRO*-2 to join a private lawsuit challenging a Pittsburgh suburb's zoning ordinance that *T*-1 sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped.
This would be the department's first suit challenging a local zoning ordinance under 1988 amendments to the Fair Housing Act.
Under those amendments, which *T*-1 took effect in March of this year, the federal government can intervene in private housing - discrimination lawsuits.
The ordinance, in Moon Township, prohibits *PRO* locating a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility.
In papers filed * with the federal district court in Pittsburgh, the Justice Department alleged that the ordinance, by *PRO* limiting the number of group homes that *T*-2 can be established *-1 in the township, makes housing unavailable on account of handicap.
The private suit was brought *-1 by three mentally retarded people who *T*-2 live in a group home in Moon.
Greg Smith, Moon Township manager, said 0 the ordinance is intended *-1 to prevent the concentration of group homes for the mentally retarded from *PRO* changing "the character and flavor of the neighborhood."
He said 0 the ordinance also will benefit the mentally retarded.
"Our intent is *PRO* to spread them out" *PRO*-1 to insure 0 they are well integrated *-2 into the community, he said 0 *T*-3.
France's unemployment rate was steady at a seasonally adjusted 9.5% in September, the Social Affairs Ministry said 0 *T*-1.
In September, the number of jobless rose 0.1% from the previous month to 2.5 million on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far - reaching bill that *T*-1 would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989.
The proposed legislation has a laudable goal: *PRO* to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets.
However, as *PRO* is common with sweeping legislation, the proposal contains many provisions that *T*-1 could destroy important parts of the system 0 it sets out *PRO*-3 to preserve *T*-2.
The complex bill, introduced * by Sens. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), and Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.), covers a wide range of provisions that *T*-2 would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way 0 the industry is regulated *-1 *T*-3.
These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that *T*-2 must be employed *-1 by exchanges, oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices, the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders, and exchange governance.
The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct.
Many aspects of the bill are salutary, *PRO*-3 providing appropriate public safeguards that *T*-2 can and should be instituted *-1 throughout the industry.
Indeed, some of the bill's requirements, including broad representation on the exchanges' boards of directors and strong measures *PRO* to prevent conflicts of interest, already have been put *-1 in place by the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges.
Other aspects of the bill, however, are either structured *-2 in ways that *T*-1 create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges, the industry and ultimately the general public.
One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that *T*-1 records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker.
The New York futures exchanges have been working together *PRO*-1 to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for * in the bill.
We would be delighted *PRO*-1 to have such a system in place today.
But is it *EXP*-3 realistic for Congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that *T*-2 has not yet been subjected *-1 to feasibility studies?
What if the system doesn't work?
What if the only system that *T*-1 does work is so expensive that, at best, only the largest exchanges can afford it?
Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets.
The U.S. futures exchanges compete world - wide as never before.
Today, trading in almost any commodity can be diverted *-1 from U.S. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard.
All foreign markets are aggressively courting U.S. business.
In fact, several London markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts.
The U.S. exchanges need both market integrity and cost - efficiency; long - term growth depends on it.
The Senate bill contains many provisions that *T*-1 will increase the costs of trading.
The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of "service fees," which *T*-1 will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets.
Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.
These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established * by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability 0 *T*-1 to include punitive damages.
In addition to *PRO*-1 increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far - reaching repercussions.
One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.
Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances.
It *EXP*-1 is only logical *PRO* to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.
In an already low - profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide *PRO*-1 to eliminate the risk and expense of *PRO* dealing with the retail public, *PRO*-2 depriving the private individual of access to the markets.
Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed * by independent floor brokers who *T*-1 execute trades for them.
This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages.
*PRO*-2 Faced *-1 with the virtually impossible task of *PRO*-1 supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely *-2 to stop *PRO*-3 doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.
This would force *PRO*-2 out of business many of the individuals and small firms that *T*-1 function as floor brokers.
A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity.
Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned *-1, unless the CFTC were *-2 to take specific and timely action *PRO*-3 to permit them *PRO*-4 to continue.
In other words, regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance, rather than through a normal deliberative procedure.
The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which *T*-2 is the way 0 most public customer orders are placed *-1 *T*-3, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way 0 *PRO* to obtain the best execution for a client *T*-4.
Also precluded would be *T*-2 dual trading, whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account *T*-3, a practice that *T*-1 provides needed liquidity to the markets.
All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision.
Nonetheless, each has too much potential value to the system *PRO* to be banned *-1 by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are *T*-2.
The markets are complex, as is *?* the environment in which they function *T*-1.
When problems surface *T*-2, the temptation *ICH*-3 becomes strong *PRO* to summarily overhaul a market system that *T*-1 has served for more than 100 years.
That temptation must be put *-3 aside *PRO* to permit careful consideration of all the implications, positive and negative, of the proposed resolutions to those problems, and to avoid *PRO*-4 creating a marketplace where no one trades *T*-2.

The Philippine government awarded Finland's Outokumpu Oy the contract *PRO* to upgrade the facilities of Philippine Associated Smelting & Refining Corp., according to documents from National Development Corp., one of Philippine company's owners.
The project costs $46.8 million *U*, and is intended *-1 to boost the company's production capacity by 25% to 34,500 metric tons of copper cathode a year.
Outokumpu is a mining, trading and construction concern.
As program trading comes under renewed attack for *PRO* causing stock market gyrations, a few people on Wall Street say 0 it is time 0 *PRO* to consider extreme measures *T*-1.
The real answer to *PRO* curbing wild swings in stock prices, they say 0 *?*, might be *PRO* to curb *RNR*-1 or even abolish *RNR*-1 stock - index futures.
A stock - index future is a contract *PRO* to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index.
Since stock futures were created *-1 in 1982, *PRO* trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where *PRO* trading in stock - index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves *T*-2.
The conventional view, as *PRO* voiced *-1 by Goldman, Sachs & Co. partner Fischer Black, is that stocks and "derivatives" such as futures and options "form a single market, and that derivatives make it a more liquid market."
But increasingly, people are questioning that view, and the critics include some of the country's most successful investors.
Warren Buffett has been on record as *PRO* opposing stock - index futures since their inception in 1982.
And Mario Gabelli, another star in the investing world, says, "My gut says 0 the negatives of futures and synthetics far outweigh the benefits."
Like others, Mr. Gabelli says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks, they will move away from stocks--as many have already done.
And those who *T*-1 remain, he says 0 *?* "will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies."
Essentially, the critics of stock - index futures fall into two camps.
One group says 0 the futures contribute to stock market volatility; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that *T*-1 detracts from the stock market's basic function of *PRO* raising capital.
"Before futures," says *?* New York investor Michael Harkins, "you actually had *-2 to pay attention to whether the thing 0 you were buying *T*-3 had any intrinsic value."
While it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices, traders now routinely check the futures markets in Chicago before they buy or sell stocks.
When Chicago futures prices jump up or down *T*-1, the New York Stock Exchange follows.
On Tuesday, for instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 80 points in little more than an hour.
Then, in the space of a 20 - minute coffee break, the average rallied almost all of the way back.
Paul Lesutis, who *T*-1 manages more than $3 billion *U* of investments at Provident Capital Management Inc., blames futures markets for *PRO* leading the way.
"The fundamentals don't change in an hour," he says *T*-1.
"I think 0 they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing."
Index arbitrage--the rapid - fire buying and selling of stocks offset * with opposite trades in futures--is frequently blamed *-1 for *PRO*-2 adding to stock market volatility.
Although index arbitrage is said *-1 to add liquidity to markets, John Bachmann, managing partner of Edward D. Jones, says 0 too much liquidity isn't a good thing
"The kind of instant liquidity that *T*-2 is implied *-1 by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day.
It's too disruptive," he says *T*-1.
"It isn't investing."
But stock - index futures have plenty of support.
Defenders say 0 futures make markets more efficient and provide ways 0 for investors to reduce risks *T*-1.
They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures.
And, defenders say 0 *?*, few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising *T*-2.
Louis Margolis, managing director in charge of equity options and futures at Salomon Inc., says that *PRO* trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s, a decade before the advent of futures.
Futures, he says 0 *?*, merely cut down on trading costs.
He says "*PRO* blaming futures is like *PRO* blaming the messenger."
Since stock - index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets, it can't add to volatility, he says 0 *T*-1.
Futures "don't need defending," says *T*-2 Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which *T*-1 trades the S&P 500, by far the largest *T*-3 stock - index futures contract.
Despite the current outcry over stock market volatility, few people expect stock futures to disappear.
For one thing, the Chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout--including many friends in Congress.
And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape.
"All life is about change--either you adapt or *PRO*-1 die," says *T*-2 one Chicago futures trader.
"If futures aren't permitted *-1 here, we'll take it to Australia or Tokyo."
Average daily volume in S&P 500 futures last year was 44,877 contracts.
*PRO*-2 Based *-1 on yesterday's closing price of the S&P, the average value of one day's trading amounts to $7.6 billion *U*.
By contrast, average dollar volume on the Big Board last year was $5.3 billion *U*.
Many investment managers say 0 futures are useful as a way 0 *PRO* to hedge portfolios *T*-1.
If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall, but want *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 owning stocks, they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts.

If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall, but want *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 owning stocks, they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts.
And although criticism of futures generally comes from Wall Street, one Chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions *T*-1.
One reason 0 futures are said *-1 to add volatility *T*-2 is that--unlike in stocks--people can speculate in futures with little money down.
Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7%.
"For $10 million *U*, you can move $100 million *U* of stocks," a specialist on the Big Board gripes *T*-1.
"That gives futures traders a lot more power."
By contrast, an investor in stocks must put up 50% in cash.
Some critics say 0 futures encourage people *PRO*-1 to think of stocks as a single commodity, rather than as investments in individual businesses.
Thus, they say 0 *?*, futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market: *PRO* to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it's needed *-1 most *T*-3.
The S&P 500 index futures "transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit - *PRO*-1 making them a simple commodity 0 *PRO* to trade *T*-2," says *T*-3 George Kegler, senior vice president at A. Webster Dougherty in Philadelphia.
"It took away the need *PRO* to know the bad third - quarter report of IBM, for example," Mr. Kegler says *T*-2.
Of course, portfolio trading--the increasingly common practice of *PRO* buying or selling baskets of actual stocks--also treats stocks as homogenous commodities.
"There is a class of investor that *T*-2 wants *PRO*-3 to be exposed *-1" to the whole market, says *T*-4 Sandip Bhagat, assistant vice president at Travelers Investment Management Co.
The S&P futures are merely a "cheaper and quicker" way 0 *PRO* to get access to all 500 stocks *T*-1, he says 0 *T*-2.
The Big Board yesterday began *-1 trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the S&P 500 stocks.
But *PRO* owning index futures isn't the same as *PRO* owning the underlying stocks.
Stockholders, as a group, can win, because they own a share of corporate earnings, which *T*-1 can grow and boost stock prices.
Futures, on the other hand, are a zero sum game--a market for *PRO* making side bets about the direction of stock prices.
"You don't own anything," says *T*-1 Stephen Boesel, a money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.
"You're making a pure bet on the market.
Private - sector union contracts signed * in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed * in the second quarter, but wage increases still are running above last year's levels.
The Labor Department said 0 wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of 3.6% in the first year and 3.0% over the life of the contracts.
The last time 0 parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases *T*-1, mostly in 1986 or 1987, wages increased an average of 2.4% a year over the life of the contracts.
If this pattern continues, the Labor Department said 0 *?*, 1989 will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase *T*-1 since 1981 when the department started *-2 comparing expiring contracts with those that *T*-5 replaced them *T*-4.
This reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who *T*-1 work in health - care facilities *.
Settlements reached * in the first nine months of 1989 called for wage increases averaging 3.7% in the first contract year and 3.1% annually over the life of the contracts, the department said 0 *T*-1.
For all of 1988, union contracts provided for 2.5% wage increases in the first year and 2.4% over the life of the contracts.
In the second quarter, contracts called for increases of 3.9% in the first year and 3.4% over the life of the contracts.
The figures exclude lump - sum payments and cost - of - living adjustments, so the actual wage increases may have been bigger.
About 35% of the workers covered * by contracts signed * in the first nine months of year get lump - sum payments; about 15% are covered *-1 by cost - of - living clauses.
Unions covered * by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases.
The Labor Department said 0 wage increases in manufacturing industries continue *-1 to be smaller than those in other industries.
For all six million workers under major collective bargaining agreements, regardless of when they were signed * *T*-1, wage increases in the first nine months of 1989 averaged 2.5%--including cost - of - living adjustments.
An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed *T*-1: He has made *PRO* speaking Filipino respectable.
The 6 1/2 - foot - tall turtle, Pong Pagong, is a character who *T*-1 stars in the children's television show "Batibot."
He speaks only in Filipino.
"Batibot," which *T*-1 started in 1983 as a hybrid of the U.S. program "Sesame Street," has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort.
Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show.
In the process, "Batibot," an archaic Filipino word meaning "strong" or "enduring," has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language.
"It impresses on ordinary, young Filipinos that there's nothing 0 *PRO* to feel inferior about *T*-1 in *PRO* using their own language," says *T*-2 Randy David, a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show.
"When we started the program six years ago *T*-1, the use of Filipino was deemed *-2 unwise by the predominantly middle class," says *T*-3 Lydia Brown, the program's creator.
Now, she says 0 *?*, "it's no longer an issue."
The success of "Batibot" stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts *PRO* to promote Filipino as a national language.
Filipino--once known * as Pilipino--is predominantly Tagalog, the Malay - based language spoken * in a part of the country's principal island of Luzon.
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country's elite, who *T*-1 generally prefer English.
But while better - off Filipinos are quick *PRO*-1 to cite the logic in *PRO* using a language as widespread as English, they are often slow *PRO*-2 to reveal that they are prejudiced against Filipino, say 0 *T*-3 advocates of the native language.
"For the middle and upper - middle class {Filipino} is declasse," says *T*-1 Bien Lumbera, a Philippine - studies professor at Quezon City's University of the Philippines.
There's also resentment.
Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions.
They argue that their own languages should have equal weight, although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country's population understands Filipino more than any other language.
(There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country.)
What tongue *PRO* to speak *T*-1 is an emotional mine field in the Philippines.
It is entrenched *-1 in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography.
As they did *?* when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S. *T*-1, teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children.
As a result, they often speak one language at home, another at school.
Mrs. Brown calls the modern - day cultural ambivalence to Filipino *PRO*-1 a "language schizophrenia."
The issue has been simmering for years.
It *EXP*-1 doesn't take much *PRO* to provoke an intense debate.
When President Corazon Aquino, whose command of Filipino *T*-1 is spotty, announced last year that the language would be used * in official communications *T*-2, there was an uproar from many legislators, who *T*-3 continue *-4 to conduct debates mostly in English.
But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling.
They believe 0 the media, including "Batibot," have played a crucial role.
According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva, "Batibot" doesn't set out *PRO*-1 to advance the cause of Filipino.
"It's not as if we're teaching language per se," he says *?*, "We're just using it."
These days, "Batibot" is produced *-1 in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $3,000 *U* a one - hour segment.
It is shown *-1 weekdays on two of the country's five networks.
With an audience totaling more than 400,000, "Batibot" consistently ranks in the country's top - four most - watched daytime programs.
But advertising revenue is inadequate.
Periodically, there are threats that the program will fold.
"Batibot" lacks the polish of "Sesame Street."
Sound stages echo.
Acting sometimes falls flat.
There are only two large puppets in the program: Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing.
But the production is the equal of any local program.
And the show's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies.
The program isn't afraid *PRO*-1 to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment.
Not that the language war is won *-1, even on "Batibot."
During one recent episode, all the advertisements were in English.
As *PRO* expected, First Interstate Bancorp reported a net loss of $15.5 million *U* for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its First Interstate Bank of Arizona unit.
The Los Angeles - based bank holding company disclosed last Friday that it had taken a huge $350 million *U* provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank, the result of the state's worsening real - estate market.
In yesterday's report, First Interstate said 0 its bank in Texas also reported a loss of $23.5 million *U* for the quarter.
But it said that its consumer banks in Oregon, California, Nevada and Washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by 14% over the year - ago period.
Dick Darman, *PRO* call your office.
Embedded *-2 in the "budget" being concocted * by the House - Senate conference committee is *T*-1 something that *T*-3 looks, smells and waddles like a duck.
It's a nuisance tax on mergers.
Congress has decided *PRO*-1 to raise $40 million *U* by *PRO*-2 charging companies $20,000 *U* for the honor of *PRO* filing the required papers under the Hart - Scott - Rodino law.
Ever since the bad days of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement, this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets.
The Hart - Scott filing is then reviewed *-1 and any antitrust concerns usually met *-4.
Typically, Hart - Scott is used *-1 now *PRO* to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance *PRO* to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic.
The $20,000 *U* tax would be a small cost in a multibillion - dollar deal, but a serious drag on thousands of small, friendly deals.
One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used *-1 *PRO* to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
This amounts to a bounty for regulators--the more regulating the more they get *PRO*-1 to keep *?*.
Also, as former Reagan antitrust chief Charles Rule has noted 0 *?*, this would "establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of *PRO* being sued *-1 regardless of whether the government prevails."
Yet another opportunity for President Bush to respond, "*PRO* Read my lips.
Line - item veto.
There are two versions of "Measure for Measure" on stage at the Alley Theater here.
One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare's play; the other is director Gregory Boyd's overlay of present - day punk rock decadence on old Vienna.
"Measure for Measure" is one of Shakespeare's "problem" plays, so named * because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy, comedy or history.
Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now *T*-1.
Last season, Hartford Stage director Mark Lamos mounted a production at Lincoln Center, and currently two other productions--one just closed * at the Old Globe in San Diego and another now at the Seattle Rep--overlap with Mr. Boyd's.
In the play, the Duke of Vienna despairs over the licentiousness of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo, *PRO*-1 hoping 0 he can set things *PRO*-2 right.
When Angelo hears that the young man Claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her *T*-1, Angelo summarily condemns Claudio to death.
When, however, Claudio's sister, Isabella, a novitiate in a convent, goes to Angelo *PRO*-1 to plead her brother's case *T*-2, the obdurate ruler immediately falls in love with her and, in a supreme act of hypocrisy, demands that Isabella yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother's life.
Meanwhile, the Duke, who *T*-1 set the original scheme in motion, appears on the scene *PRO*-2 disguised *-3 as a friar and becomes involved in a series of intrigues that *T*-4 has everyone fearing the worst possible outcome until the Duke arranges a last minute reprieve for all concerned.
For the Alley production, scene designer Peter David Gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a rectangular platform of white - washed boards that *T*-1 extends into the audience.
When the action requires *T*-1, a prison cell, consisting of an enlarged wire cage, rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform.
In the play's major scenes Mr. Boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic.
When Isabella (Ellen Lauren) confronts her brother Claudio (Matt Loney) in his cell, *PRO*-1 explaining the price 0 she has been asked * *T*-2 *PRO* to secure his freedom *T*-3; when Isabella and the disguised Duke (Philip Kerr) conspire *PRO*-4 to trick Angelo *T*-5; and when Mariana (Annalee Jefferies), a woman wronged * by Angelo, confronts him with his past misdeeds *T*-6, the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence.
At such moments Mr. Boyd makes it *EXP*-1 clear that he has the capacity 0 *PRO* to be a superior interpreter of Shakespeare *T*-2.
When, however, he decides *PRO*-1 to be modern *T*-3, or more accurately, when he decides *PRO*-2 to be trendy *T*-4, the results are far less satisfactory.
Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that *T*-1 believes 0 one must find modern parallels or metaphors *PRO*-2 to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences.
It's a valid approach, but it puts a heavy burden *ICH*-1 on the director *PRO* to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste.
In his "Measure," Mr. Boyd has "modernized" the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed *-2 to bring *T*-1 under control by *PRO*-3 converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno - inspired costumes.
Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes, even those in the convent.
When Claudio is arrested *-1 *T*-2, he is brought *-3 on stage *PRO*-4 nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles.
When the opportunist Lucio (Jack Stehlin) visits the convent *PRO*-1 to inform Isabella of her brother's fate *T*-2, Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (Jill Powell), not in Shakespeare's script, 0 *T*-3 to undulate lasciviously.
Meanwhile, the pimp Pompey (Glen Allen Pruett), *PRO*-2 dressed in black leather and a prominent codpiece, indulges in enough obscene gestures and pelvic thrusts 0 *T*-1 to launch a space probe.
The problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination.
The inclusion at one point, for example, of a list of glitzy modern - day malefactors, ranging from Jim Bakker and Leona Helmsley to Zsa Zsa Gabor, is a bid for a cheap laugh unworthy of Mr. Boyd's ability.
Despite the excesses, however, the scorecard for the production has many more pluses than minuses.
What *T*-1's more, it represents an important step for the Alley Theater.
"Measure for Measure" is Mr. Boyd's first directorial assignment as the theater's new artistic director.
He succeeded Pat Brown, who *T*-1 was fired *-2 by the Alley board 18 months ago.
Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler, head of Theatre Communications Group, *PRO*-1 to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board.
None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative.
Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts.
Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage, the balance sheet is the best 0 the theater has had *T*-1 in 10 years.
As *PRO* opposed to the $1.4 million *U* deficit of the 1987 - 88 season, the 1988 - 89 year concluded with a $200,000 *U* surplus and a $500,000 *U* cash reserve.
Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did *T*-1 cost cutting and other measures insisted on * by the board.
Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim 0 it received *T*-1 when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers *T*-2.
But it is clear 0 he is going *-1 to give it a shot.
Democratic leaders have bottled up President Bush's capital - gains tax cut in the Senate and may be able *PRO*-1 to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said 0 he intends *PRO*-1 to use Senate procedures *PRO*-2 to force advocates of the tax cut *PRO*-3 to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue.
And neither Democrats nor Republicans are predicting that the capital - gains forces can produce enough votes.
"The 60 - vote requirement will be there and they don't have the 60 votes," Sen. Mitchell said *T*-1.
"They don't have the votes 0 *PRO* to get it passed *T*-1."
Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut, didn't disagree.
"I'm not sure what *T*-1's going *-2 to happen," he said *T*-3.
Previously he had said 0 he would be able *PRO*-1 to find the requisite 60 votes eventually.
Sen. Packwood has offered his capital - gains - cut package as an amendment to a bill, now pending in the Senate, that *T*-1 would authorize aid to Poland and Hungary.
Democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by *PRO*-1 threatening a filibuster, or extended debate.
For a cloture vote *PRO* to stop the filibuster, Republicans must muster at least 60 votes.
Yesterday, Sen. Packwood acknowledged, "We don't have the votes for cloture today."
The Republicans show no sign of *PRO* relenting.
GOP leaders continued *-1 to press for a vote on the amendment to the Eastern Europe aid measure.
And they threatened *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to amend any other revenue bill in the Senate with the capital - gains provision.
"This is serious business; we're serious about a capital - gains reduction," said Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, the Senate's Republican leader.
"The strategy is ` *PRO* Let's vote."'
The Republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the 100 - member Senate for a capital - gains tax cut.
They accuse the Democrats of *PRO*-1 unfairly using Senate rules *PRO*-2 to erect a 60 - vote hurdle.
Democrats counter that the Republicans have often used the same rules *PRO*-1 to suit their own ends.
The two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the Packwood plan.
Democrats asserted that the proposal, which *T*-1 also would create a new type of individual retirement account, was fraught with budget gimmickry that *T*-2 would lose billions of dollars in the long run.
Republicans countered that long - range revenue estimates were unreliable.
The Packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held *-1 *T*-2.
It also would create a new IRA that *T*-1 would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made * for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first - home purchases and tuition.
A White House spokesman said 0 President Bush is "generally supportive" of the Packwood plan.
Black & Decker Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives unit to Orkem S.A., a French chemical company, for $345 million *U*.
Bostik is the first Emhart Corp. unit 0 *T*-1 to be sold *-2 as part of the power - tool manufacturer's effort *PRO* to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired Emhart earlier this year.
Black & Decker said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to put other Emhart units on the block in the future, with the goal of *PRO* raising $1 billion *U* in net proceeds.
Black & Decker rescued Emhart from the takeover bid of Topper Limited Partnership last March by *PRO*-1 agreeing *PRO*-2 to acquire the maker of door locks and gardening tools for about $2.8 billion *U*.
The move significantly expanded Black & Decker's product line, but also significantly increased its debt load.
The acquisition boosted Black & Decker's ratio of debt to total capital to more than 80%.
Company officials have said 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to reduce that ratio to less than 50% over the next 2 1/2 years.
Earlier this year, Black & Decker put three Emhart businesses *ICH*-1 on the auction block: the information and electronics segment, the Dynapert electrical assembly business and Mallory Capacitors.
The three units had combined 1988 sales of about $904 million *U*.
The three units contributed about a third of Emhart's total sales.
In addition, Black & Decker had said 0 it would sell two other undisclosed Emhart operations if it received the right price.
Bostic is one of the previously unnamed units, and the first of the five 0 *T*-1 to be sold *-2.
The company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects *PRO*-1 to announce agreements by the end of the year.
The five units generated sales of about $1.3 billion *U* *ICH*-1 in 1988, almost half of Emhart's $2.3 billion *U* revenue.
Bostic posted 1988 sales of $255 million *U*.
"Our divestiture program is on schedule, and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $1 billion *U* in net proceeds," said *T*-1 Nolan D. Archibald, Black & Decker's president and chief executive officer, in a statement.
The sales are an attempt *PRO* to quell investor concern about Black & Decker's increased debt burden from the Emhart purchase.
The company's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned *PRO*-1 to acquire Emhart *T*-2.
The company maintains that it doesn't expect Emhart to contribute to earnings for about another 12 months.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Black & Decker closed at $19.75 *U* yesterday, down 25 cents.
The company didn't announce the sale until after the close of the market.
The House joined the Senate in *PRO*-1 making federal reparations for Japanese - Americans held * in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement requiring the Treasury Department *PRO*-2 to meet expedited payments of an estimated $1.25 billion *U* during the next several years.
The 249 - 166 roll call came as the chamber approved a compromise bill allocating $17.2 billion *U* to the departments of State, Justice, and Commerce in fiscal 1990 and imposing increased fees on business interests making filings with the government.
An estimated $40 million *U* would come annually from a new $20,000 *U* charge on pre-merger notifications to the Justice Department, and Securities and Exchange Commission filing fees would rise by 25% *PRO* to fund a $26 million *U* increase in the agency's budget.
Yesterday's vote on Japanese - American reparations ensures final enactment of the entitlement provision, which *T*-1 abandons earlier efforts *PRO* to find offsetting cuts but is seen *-2 as a more realistic path to *PRO* expediting compensation first authorized * in 1988.
"The only way 0 *PRO* to reduce the costs *T*-2 is *PRO* to say 0 we don't want *PRO*-1 to pay the bill," said *T*-4 Rep. Neal Smith (D., Iowa), who *T*-3 taunted President Bush's party to back up his campaign promise of *PRO* supporting the claims of $20,000 *U* per individual.
"*PRO* Read my lips," said *T*-1 Mr. Smith.
"If you're for *PRO* paying the claims...I don't know how anyone can oppose this *T*-1."
No payments would be made *-1 this year, but *PRO* beginning in fiscal 1991, the bill commits the government to annual payments of as much as $500 million *U* until the total liability of $1.25 billion *U* is met *-2.
The issue has assumed some of the character of past civil - rights debates and reopens old regional divisions in the Democratic majority.
As much as Republicans led the opposition, among the 53 Democrats voting against *PRO* treating the payments as an entitlement, 42 *T*-1 came from the 13 states in the Old Dixiecrat South and its borders.
The odd mix of departments in the underlying bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and it is a lightning rod for a running battle over the fate of the Legal Services Corp.
The measure provides $321 million *U* 0 *T*-1 to maintain services but would sharply curb the power of the current board until successors are agreed to *-2 by the Bush administration.
The conservative bent of the incumbent appointees, named * by former President Reagan, has divided Republicans.
And on back - to - back roll calls, 206 - 199 and 223 - 178, the Appropriations Committee leadership turned back efforts *PRO* to weaken or strip the proposed restrictions first added * by Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.)
The estimated $40 million *U* from the new pre-merger notification fee would be divided *-1 between the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, which *T*-2 both face serious cuts if the income isn't realized *.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is slated *-1 *PRO*-3 to receive $30 million *U* by *PRO* charging for fingerprint services in civil cases, and the judiciary will rely on another $32 million *U* from bankruptcy charges, including a 33% increase in the current filing fee.
The $17.2 billion *U* total for the bill doesn't include an estimated $1.2 billion *U* in supplemental anti-drug funds approved * by the House - Senate conference yesterday, and the rush of money is already provoking jealousy among states competing for assistance.
The House agreed *PRO*-1 to defer for a year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law - enforcement grants but, by a 287 - 123 margin, the chamber stripped a Senate initiative *PRO* to raise the minimum grant for smaller states, such as New Hampshire and Delaware, to $1.6 million *U* from $500,000 *U*.
Few are more powerful *ICH*-1 in the competition for funds than the appropriations committees themselves--including the three authors of the Gramm - Rudman - Hollings deficit - reduction law.
When a House - Senate conference on yesterday's bill rescinded $11.8 million *U* in unexpended funds for a Fort Worth, Texas, economic development project backed * by former Speaker James Wright *T*-1, Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) insisted last week that the money be preserved *-2.
The measure includes $2 million *U* secured * by Mr. Rudman for a marine - research project at the University of New Hampshire, and Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C .) used his power *PRO*-1 to add $10 million *U* for an advanced technology initiative in the Commerce Department.
This was in addition to a more parochial $4.5 million *U* authorization for a health center in South Carolina upheld * by a 273 - 121 vote in the House last night.
F. Gil Troutman, 46 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chief executive officer.
He retains his titles of president and chief operating officer and succeeds as chief executive Howard O. Painter Jr., who *T*-1 remains chairman of the board.

In search of buyers for upscale department - store chains such as Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue, investment bankers are turning to--who else? The Japanese.
But so far Japan's cash - rich retailers are proving *-1 to be cautious shoppers.
"We have the money 0 *PRO* to buy *T*-1.
But *PRO* operating a U.S. department - store chain would be very difficult," says *T*-1 Motoyuki Homma, managing director of the international division at Mitsukoshi Ltd., one of Japan's leading department stores.
Japanese retail executives say 0 the main reason 0 they are reluctant *PRO*-1 to jump into the fray in the U.S. *T*-2 is that--unlike manufacturing--retailing is extremely sensitive to local cultures and life styles.
The Japanese have watched the Europeans and Canadians stumble in the U.S. market, and they fret that business practices that *T*-1 have won them huge profits at home won't translate into success in the U.S. .
Japanese department stores are also wary of *PRO*-1 attracting negative publicity.
After Sony Corp.'s recent headline - grabbing acquisition of Columbia Pictures, many say 0 it *EXP*-1 makes good political sense *PRO* to lie low.
"It's a question of timing," says *T*-1 Mayumi Takayama, managing director of international operations at Isetan Co., a Tokyo department store.
Still, for those with a long - term eye on the vast U.S. retail market, this is a tempting time 0 *PRO* to look for bargains *T*-1.
Britain's B.A.T Industries PLC is trying *PRO*-1 to unwind its U.S. retailing operations, which *T*-2 include such well - known stores as Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's, Breuners and Ivey's.
And debt - ridden Campeau Corp. of Toronto is giving up the 17 - store Bloomingdale's group.
"Every department store in Japan is taking a look," says *T*-1 Mike Allen, a retail analyst at Barclay's de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd.
Mr. Allen, however, doesn't think that Japan is about *-1 to embark on a major buying binge.
Nonetheless, speculation heated up yesterday when Tokyu Department Store Co. confirmed a report *ICH*-1 in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, that Tokyu is talking with Campeau about *PRO* buying Bloomingdale's *T*-2.
Tokyu, however, said 0 no agreement had been reached *-1.
Nor is Tokyu the only Japanese retailer interested in Bloomingdale's, which bankers in Tokyo estimate 0 *T*-1 could cost between $1 billion and $1.5 billion *U*.
Seven Japanese department - store groups were approached *-1 by investment bankers representing Bloomingdale's chairman, Marvin Traub, and more than half are seeking additional information on the group, bankers say 0 *T*-2.
What Mr. Traub is hoping *PRO*-1 to put *T*-2 together, investment bankers say *?*, is a management - led group 0 *T*-3 to buy the New York department - store group that he heads *T*-5 from Campeau's Federated Department Stores subsidiary.
Federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired *-1 last year by Campeau, which *T*-2 relied heavily on debt *PRO*-3 to finance the transaction.
*PRO* Paying off that debt put such a squeeze *ICH*-2 on Campeau and its stores that Federated decided *PRO*-1 to sell off the jewels of its retailing empire, including Bloomingdale's.
*PRO*-2 Hoping *PRO*-1 to avoid another takeover, Mr. Traub retained Blackstone Group and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. *PRO*-3 to help him *PRO*-4 find partners for a management - led buy - out.
Ideally, investment bankers say 0 *?*, he wants *PRO*-1 to get backing from a Japanese department store and a European department store 0 *PRO* to forge a global retailing network *T*-2.
"When you look at the economics *T*-1, Traub needs a Japanese *RNR*-2 and a European *RNR*-2 partner *PRO*-3 to make it work," says *T*-5 one investment banker who *T*-4 follows the retail industry.
"*PRO* Looking only at a narrow American strategy isn't where it's at *T*-1."
*PRO* Persuading tradition - bound Japanese retailers *PRO*-2 to get involved in the turmoils of the U.S. retailing industry isn't likely *PRO*-1 to be so easy, analysts say 0 *T*-3.
Up until now, most stores have followed the same basic overseas strategy:
First they set up overseas merchandising offices 0 *T*-1 to import items and track new fashion trends.
Then they opened small gift shops mostly aimed * at Japanese tourists.
*PRO*-2 Reluctant *PRO*-1 to advance further on their own, some stores have settled for tie - ups with famous specialty shops.
Last March, Isetan invested 1.5 billion yen ($10.6 million *U*) in a venture with Barney's Inc., an up - scale New York specialty clothier.
The first Barney's shop is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to open in Japan next year.
And Mitsukoshi recently increased its equity stake in Tiffany & Co. to 13%.
Through the longstanding relationship between the two companies, Mitsukoshi has opened 22 Tiffany shops in its stores and arcades in Japan.
Plans *ICH*-2 are under way *PRO* to open a Tiffany's in Hawaii 0 *T*-1 to cater to Japanese tourists; it will be run *-3 mostly by Mitsukoshi.
Some industry observers say that Mitsukoshi's classy image makes it a possible match for Saks Fifth Avenue.
Company officials say 0 they are studying various proposals but won't discuss details.
Takashimaya Co., Japan's oldest department store, is another name that *T*-1 keeps *-2 popping up as a potential fit with Saks.
Eiji Nakazato, a Takashimaya general manager, admits that his company's image is similar to Saks's and that there is some interest in the idea.
But he stops there.
"We'd like *PRO*-1 to do business in America," he says *T*-2.
"But it looks tough."

The Vatican was in the red last year.
It said 0 the regular 1988 deficit amounted to $43.5 million *U*, based on revenue of $74.4 million *U* and expenses of $117.9 million *U*.
But it said 0 extraordinary expenditures for its radio station and restoration of buildings increased the deficit to $57.2 million *U*.

British postal authorities say 0 they have uncovered a large - scale scheme where unscrupulous stamp dealers chemically removed stamp cancellations, regummed the stamps and sold them to U.S. collectors or, in large lots, to British businesses *T*-1.
The scheme allegedly cost the post office #10 million *U* ($16.1 *U*) in revenue in the past 12 months.
Dealers bought the used stamps cheaply from charities, including the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.
The charities regularly sell used stamps, which they collect *T*-1 from children and other donors, *PRO*-2 to raise funds.

Michael Grobstein, 46 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 vice chairman for planning, marketing and industry services, a new post.
Mr. Grobstein had been a vice chairman of Ernst & Whinney, an accounting firm that *T*-1 merged with rival Arthur Young in July *PRO*-2 to form Ernst & Young, a major accounting, tax and management consulting firm.
Mr. Grobstein's appointment formalizes a role 0 he has been performing *T*-1 since the merger, a spokeswoman said 0 *T*-2.
The growing crowd of Japanese investors buying up foreign companies aren't all strait - laced businessmen in dark suits.
Yasumichi Morishita, whose art gallery *T*-1 last month became a major shareholder in Christies International PLC, the London auction house, is one man who *T*-2 doesn't fit the mold.
In Japan, he's known *-1 in racy weekly magazines as the "King of Shady Money."
If nothing else, the 57 - year - old's past has its share of dents.
Nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Morishita, founder and chairman of Aichi Corp., a finance company, received a 10 - month suspended sentence from a Tokyo court for *PRO*-1 violating a money - lending law and an income tax law.
He was convicted *-1 of *PRO*-2 charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted *T*-3, and attempting *PRO*-4 to evade income taxes by *PRO*-5 using a double accounting system.
He's had other brushes with the law.
He was arrested *-1, though not indicted *, on at least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s: for assault and unlawful confinement, for fraud and forgery of private documents, and for extortion.
Christies says 0 it has had no contact with Mr. Morishita since the stock purchase, but that it's happy *PRO*-1 to deal with him.
"We like *PRO*-1 to make our own judgments" about Mr. Morishita, says 0 *T*-2 Christopher Davidge, Christies' group managing director.
"People have a different reputation country by country."
Mr. Morishita is a leading figure among Japan's 38,000 "machikin," which *T*-1 lend to small companies, and "sarakin," which *T*-2 lend to individuals.
Many of these financiers lend freely, often without *PRO*-1 demanding collateral.
But the interest rates 0 they charge *T*-1 are often near Japan's 54.75% legal limit, says *T*-2 Kenji Utsunomiya, a lawyer specializing in loan troubles.
Aichi is a machikin, Mr. Utsunomiya says 0 *?*, and "one of the nasty ones."
In *PRO*-2 describing that business in general, he says that when the client can't repay the loan *T*-1, some machikin "clutch on like hyenas" and even take over the client's company.
Last month, Mr. Morishita's new gallery, Aska International Ltd., purchased 6.4% of Christies for #33 million *U* ($53.3 million *U*).
*PRO*-2 Acquired *-1 from Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd., a company owned * by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court, the stake was apparently the first of its kind for Aska, an entity separate from Aichi.
And the acquisition, which *T*-1 made Aska one of Christies' top five shareholders, left many people *PRO*-4 wondering who this man was *T*-2 and what his intentions were *T*-3.
"We're an investor," Mr. Morishita says *T*-2, *PRO*-1 sitting back in his purple gallery filled * with some 20 Monets and Renoirs.
"In the long run, the {stock} prices will go up."
It *EXP*-1's not clear whether Aska plans *PRO*-2 to buy more shares.
But Christies, Mr. Morishita insists 0 *?*, is happy *PRO*-1 to see him become a long - term stockholder.
Mr. Morishita considers himself a connoisseur of art.
In 30 years of *PRO* collecting impressionist and Japanese paintings, he has acquired 600 items, he says 0 *?*, enough 0 *T*-1 to persuade him *PRO*-2 to start a museum next year.
He says 0 he spent $300 million *U* on his art business this year.
A week ago, his gallery racked up a $23 million *U* tab at a Sotheby's auction in New York *PRO*-1 buying seven works, including a Picasso.
"He makes snap judgments," says *T*-1 Kiyotaka Kori, the art gallery's manager and Mr. Morishita's secretary for more than seven years.
Mr. Morishita's main business certainly appears *-1 to be thriving, although he won't disclose numbers.
According to Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., which *T*-1 tracks company earnings, Aichi's revenue rose 15% to 49.3 billion yen ($348.4 million *U*) in the year ended February.
Revenue doubled from two years ago.
That is, if the company reported results correctly.
The Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese daily, last month reported that Aichi revised its tax calculations after *PRO*-1 being challenged *-2 for *PRO*-3 allegedly failing *-4 to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two - year period.
The Tokyo Regional Taxation Office declines *PRO*-1 to comment, and Mr. Kori, the tycoon's secretary, says 0 the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what *T*-2 was considered *-3 income.
The small, wiry Mr. Morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world.
*PRO* Stretching his arms in his silky white shirt and squeaking his black shoes, he lectures a visitor about the way 0 *PRO* to sell American real estate *T*-1 and boasts about his friendship with Margaret Thatcher's son.
But when *PRO*-3 asked what exactly he does *T*-1 in business *T*-2, he immediately takes offense.
"Are you stupid?" he snaps.
"You should know what questions *PRO* to ask *T*-1 *PRO* to get people to answer."
Not many people know the details of Mr. Morishita's business, but it's a source of rumors about shady dealings.
When a small company goes belly - up *T*-1, for instance, the gossipy weekly magazines are often quick *PRO*-2 to link the demise with Aichi.
Mr. Morishita scoffs at those stories, as well as the ones connecting him to the Japanese mob.
He says 0 he has never even dined with gangsters.
*PRO*-1 The seventh child of a store owner in Aichi prefecture, Mr. Morishita started out in the textile business.
From there, he set up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to *PRO* building golf courses.
He spends most weekends *PRO*-1 flying his helicopter to one of his nine courses, he says 0 *?*, two of which *T*-2 were designed *-3 by Jack Nicklaus.
He also owns courses in the U.S. and France.
The gruff financier recently started *-1 socializing in upper - class circles.
Although he says 0 he wasn't keen on *PRO*-2 going, last year he attended a New York gala where his daughter made her debut *T*-1.
He also leads an opulent life style.
Even in Denenchofu, one of Tokyo's richest neighborhoods, Mr. Morishita's splashy brick manor--one of some 10 houses 0 he owns *T*-1--outshines the neighbors'.
A lavish white portico with a stained - glass window towers over the brick wall surrounding his property.
Although Mr. Morishita says little about his business, he offers one rule to success: *PRO* Never gamble too far.
"I quit after one try, whether I win or lose," he says *T*-1.
"I'm done in two minutes."
Mr. Morishita says 0 he intends *PRO*-1 to expand his business to many other areas at home and abroad.
He'll be there wherever there's money 0 *T*-1 to be made * *T*-2, laughs 0 *T*-3 Mr. Kori, the secretary.

Arthur Price resigned as president and chief executive officer of MTM Enterprises Inc., a Studio - City, Calif., entertainment concern.
He co-founded the company with Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore in 1969.
MTM is a unit of British - based TVS Entertainment PLC, whose chief executive officer, James Gatward, *T*-1 will oversee the company until a successor is named *-2.
The 1986 Tax Reform Act has nearly eliminated the number of large, profitable corporations that *T*-1 don't pay federal income tax, according to Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit, labor - funded research and lobbying group.
In a study of 250 of the nation's richest companies, the group found that only seven managed *PRO*-1 to avoid *PRO*-2 paying federal income taxes last year compared with 40 in 1986, the last year 0 the old tax rules were in effect *T*-3, and 16 in 1987, when some of the new tax provisions went into effect *T*-4.
Moreover, 41 companies that *T*-1 paid no federal income tax from 1981 through 1985--despite billions of dollars of profits--ended up *PRO*-2 paying an average of 27.9% of their income in federal taxes in 1988.
The report, *PRO* released *-1 yesterday, comes as Congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping tax - revision legislation abolished or curtailed many loopholes.
In the corporate realm, the 1986 law abolished the investment - tax credit, scaled back use of an accounting method that *T*-1 allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed *-3 and strengthened the so - called alternative minimum tax, a levy 0 *T*-2 to ensure 0 all money - making businesses pay some federal tax.
The combination of lower rates and fewer loopholes has meant that the so - called average effective tax rate--the rate actually paid *--of the 250 corporations surveyed * reached 26.5% in 1988, compared with 14.3% in the years from 1981 through 1985, according to the study.
In addition, corporations are now shouldering a bigger share of the tax burden, as the authors of the 1986 law hoped.
Corporate taxes paid for almost 12% of federal spending in 1988--excluding Social Security--compared with less than 8% in the first half of the 1980s, the study found *T*-1.
"Tax reform is working," the study said *T*-1.
"Under the new tax - reform law, the days of widespread, wholesale corporate tax avoidance have come to an end."
Still, Kroger Co., Pinnacle West Capital Corp., CSX Corp., Illinois Power Co., Media General Inc., Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and Gulf States Utilities Co., didn't pay any federal income tax last year although they garnered a total of $1.2 billion *U* in profits, the group said *T*-1.
In fact, six of those companies received refunds, which *T*-1 totaled $120 million *U*.
The lobbying group used publicly available information *PRO*-1 to calculate each company's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments.
This is the fifth year 0 Citizens for Tax Justice has released a study on corporate tax bills *T*-1.
Earlier reports, which *T*-1 revealed that as many as 73 companies were avoiding income tax legally, have been credited * with *PRO*-2 helping *PRO*-3 galvanize efforts *PRO* to overhaul the tax code.
But even though companies are paying more taxes, many are still paying less than the statutory rate, the report said 0 *T*-1.
And 45 companies paid effective tax rates of below 10% of their income.
"While the overall picture is very encouraging, significant corporate tax avoidance continues," the study said *T*-1.

Two old friends, George Bush and Deng Xiaoping, are trying *PRO*-1 to limit further damage to U.S. - China ties.
But as Congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against Beijing, the already - tense relationship could get worse.
The problem for Congress will be *PRO*-3 to weigh what China is saying *T*-1 to its people against the more conciliatory message 0 it is delivering *T*-2 to the Bush administration.
In a move apparently aimed * at *PRO* heading off new punitive legislation, Mr. Deng sent an indirect signal to Washington via T.D. Lee, a Columbia University physicist who *T*-1 met Mr. Deng and other Chinese leaders in Beijing last month.
When he met with Mr. Bush on his return *T*-2, Mr. Lee says 0 *?*, he told the president that the Chinese "made statements *ICH*-1 to me that I regard *T*-4 as a first step toward reconciliation."
The communication 0 Mr. Lee brought *T*-1 represents the softer line 0 the U.S. has been hoping *PRO*-3 to hear *T*-2 from Chinese officials since the June 4 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
The Chinese leader, Mr. Lee informed Mr. Bush 0 *?*, expressed some regret for what *T*-1 had happened in Beijing and conceded that China's officials bore some responsibility.
Mr. Lee says 0 Mr. Deng told him: "We should not mind those who *T*-1 participated in demonstrations, signed anti-government materials and went on hunger strikes."
Mr. Deng added, says 0 *?* Mr. Lee, that "we really made mistakes.
We must not shirk our responsibility and we cannot just blame the demonstrators."
Mr. Lee also reported to the president that, in a separate meeting, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin said 0 the Chinese leadership "looked kindly on the students who *T*-1 took part in the demonstrations."
Mr. Jiang also pledged that the Chinese Red Cross would publish "very soon" a list of those killed *.
And he told the physicist that China's leaders were "very much concerned" about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims' families.
"I transmitted my conversations to the White House," Prof. Lee says *T*-1.
But, he adds, "I was not acting as a messenger."
He says that the Chinese never asked him *PRO*-1 to convey their statements to President Bush, but that the White House spontaneously invited him *PRO*-2 to do so.
Mr. Lee concedes 0 the statements made * to him are far different from others being issued * in China, but attributes that to the fact that the situation in China is "very complex."
According to U.S. sources in Beijing, the administration hopes 0 Mr. Deng's fairly conciliatory comments will prod Congress *PRO*-1 to be cautious about further sanctions against Beijing.
"The president doesn't want *PRO*-2 to have legislative sanctions," says *T*-1 a U.S. official.
"But he may not have a choice."
*PRO* Given China's far - from - conciliatory statements to its own people, Mr. Bush may be unable *PRO*-1 to prevent new sanctions.
Beijing officials have said 0 they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who *T*-1 participated in the demonstrations.
Sentences have been stiff.
A university student got eight years for *PRO* participating in the rallies, sources in Beijing said 0 *?*, while an 18 - year - old worker got 10 years.
Nor has Beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the identities of those killed *.
So far, the victims are officially considered *-1 evil - doers, and their families receive no compensation.
A man gunned * down by a stray bullet while *PRO* cycling to work carries, after his death, the official stigma of "counterrevolutionary," his wife says 0 *T*-1.
What *T*-1's more, much of China's official rhetoric is hostile to the U.S. .
China frequently lambastes the U.S. Embassy for *PRO*-2 harboring astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, a political dissident who *T*-1 took refuge there after the massacre.
"In the U.S., there are still people who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to crush China and interfere in our internal affairs," Zhu Qizhen, China's new ambassador to the U.S., said *T*-3 as he left for Washington last week.
The House and Senate are *-1 to begin soon *-2 hashing out an agreement for sanctions legislation.
It will probably be attached *-1 to a State Department authorization bill, which Mr. Bush isn't expected *-3 to veto *T*-2.
A congressional staffer involved * in *PRO* drafting the sanctions says 0 they are likely *-2 to mirror those 0 Mr. Bush enacted *T*-1 shortly after the massacre.
But as legislative action, they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult 0 *PRO* to rescind *T*-1.
Measures already in effect that *T*-2 are expected *-3 to be made *-1 law include a ban on military sales and exchanges, a suspension of most high - level government contacts and a halt to U.S. trade enhancement programs, such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Trade Development Program.
*PRO* Codifying those sanctions could prompt Chinese retaliation.
"If the two sides aren't careful, U.S. - China ties could spin downward, out of control," says *T*-1 a U.S. official in Beijing.
"Bush and Deng are hoping {that} cooler heads prevail.
Mercedes - Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler - Benz AG, paid Massachusetts $9.1 million *U* in taxes, *PRO* bringing to an end a 10 - month - long corporate tax chase.
Officials at the Department of Revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed * on business transactions and were proceeding *PRO*-1 to settle the dispute in court.
But "the check arrived in the mail," said 0 *T*-1 Stephen Kidder, Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue.
Mercedes - Benz, which *T*-1 had said 0 it didn't owe taxes to Massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a dock in Baltimore and not in Massachusetts, didn't explain its change of heart.
Last month, Mercedes - Benz executives approached state revenue officials *PRO*-2 complaining about bad press, the commissioner said 0 *T*-1.
The dispute was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in August.
The amount covers taxes, interest and penalties owed * from 1966, when the state began *-2 collecting corporate taxes *T*-1, to 1985.
Mercedes - Benz also agreed *PRO*-1 to pay taxes owed * for the years 1986 through 1988, Mr. Kidder added 0 *T*-2.
Under Massachusetts tax laws, corporations must pay 9.5% of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company conducts a variety of non-sales activities, including warranties, customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships.
Regarding your Oct. 4 page - one article "Bad Blood" on the generic - drug battle: The Epilepsy Institute is not just a patient - advocacy organization.
It is primarily a certified outpatient treatment facility providing comprehensive services to people with epilepsy and their families.
The institute's advocacy efforts are based *-1 on the needs of the population 0 it serves and represents *T*-2.
In 1985, the Medical Tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the FDA bioequivalence - therapeutic - equivalence equation.
"They contend 0 it is based *-1 on an assumption that *T*-3 has not yet been proven *-2 in valid tests," the Tribune said *T*-4.
In 1986, some institute patients were reporting breakthrough seizures when they were switched *-1 from a specific brand - name medication to a generic one or from one generic manufacturer of a specific product to another *T*-2.
In addition, neurologists were beginning *-1 to report these observations as well.
*PRO* Call it *PRO*-1 anecdotal if you will *?*.
But no ethical physician would switch patients who *T*-1 were doing well on a specific medication from a specific manufacturer *PRO*-2 to prove a point.
We do not depend on pharmaceutical companies for our support.
The institute has governmental service contracts for the provision of direct patient services; collects patient fees; receives money through contributions from individuals, foundations and bequests.
The funds received * from pharmaceutical firms are used *-1 *PRO* to offset physician symposiums, and these symposiums do not stress any particular medication or manufacturer.
The Epilepsy Institute's reporting of breakthrough seizures stemmed from concerns about the people 0 we treat *T*-1 and care about *T*-1 daily.
This perhaps was perceived *-1 as a "bold" stance, and thus suspicious.
But *PRO* let us not confuse profits of big business masquerading as concerns for people's health care or for the cost.
For whom is the saving *T*-1?
Surely not to people with epilepsy who *T*-1 depend on the same levels of medication in their bloodstream daily *PRO*-2 to maintain seizure control.

Motorola is fighting back against junk mail.
So much of the stuff *ICH*-1 poured into its Austin, Texas, offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped *-2 delivering it.
Now, thousands of mailers, catalogs and sales pitches go straight into the trash.
"We just don't have the staff 0 *T*-3 to {deliver} it, nor do we have the space or the time," says *T*-2 a spokesman for the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics company, which *T*-1 has 5,000 employees in the Austin area.
"It's the overload problem and the weight problem 0 we have *T*-1."
Motorola is in good company.
Businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail, and some are saying 0 they just aren't going *-1 to take it anymore--literally.
While no one has tracked how many company mail rooms *T*-1 throw out junk mail, direct - mail advertising firms say 0 the number is growing.
General Motors earlier this year said 0 it wouldn't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its Flint, Mich., office, while Air Products & Chemicals, Allentown, Pa., says 0 it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing.
Why the revolt?
Anybody with a mailbox can answer that: sheer, overwhelming, mind - numbing volume.
According to the Direct Marketing Association, total direct mail--to both businesses and consumers--jumped 50% to 65.4 billion pieces in 1988 from five years earlier.
Though direct mail to businesses isn't broken out *-1 separately, the association says 0 it's growing even faster.
The deluge has spurred cost - conscious companies to action, with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money *PRO*-1 to deliver it.
The direct - mail industry, not surprisingly, is fuming at the injustice of it all.
After all, this is the industry that *T*-1 has a hard enough time getting any respect, that *T*-2 is the butt of so many jokes that television's "L.A. Law" portrays direct - mail - mogul David as short, bald, intensely nerdy, and unremittingly boring.
The practice of businesses throwing out junk mail "is a commonly known problem, and it's increasing as companies attempt *PRO*-2 to put through budget cuts across the board," right down to the mail - room level, says 0 *T*-1 Stephen Belth, a list consultant and chairman of the Direct Marketing Association's business - to - business council.
"But it's like *PRO* biting the hand that *T*-1 feeds them, because every one of these companies uses direct marketing."
It *EXP*-1's almost impossible *PRO* to track the number of companies trashing junk mail, since the decision is usually made *-2 in the mail room--not the board room.
And the practice often varies from location to location even within a company.
But industry executives say 0 businesses seem *-1 especially inclined *PRO*-2 to dump mailers sent * to titles rather than to individual names.
Motorola's Austin operation was one of the first 0 *T*-2 to lose patience, *PRO*-4 deciding a few years ago *PRO*-3 to junk any bulk mail that *T*-1 wasn't addressed to an individual.
Magazines aren't delivered *-5 at all, even if an individual's name is listed *-1; employees who *T*-2 want their magazines have *-3 to pick them up from the mail room or the company library--and are told *-3 *PRO*-4 to change the subscriptions to their home addresses.
At Air Products, meanwhile, the mailroom staff opens junk mail and often throws it away--even if *PRO* addressed *-1 to an individual.
"If they get 50 packets of something, they open one, see what it says *T*-1, throw 48 away and send two to people or departments 0 they think *T*-2 are appropriate," a spokesman says *T*-3.
Direct marketers were especially alarmed when General Motors--one of the country's largest companies and a big direct - mail user itself--entered the junk - mail battle *T*-1.
As of March 1, its Flint office, with about 2,500 employees, stopped *-1 delivering bulk mail and non-subscription magazines.
Employees were told *-1 that if they really wanted the publications, they would have *-2 to have them sent home instead.
The reason: overload, especially of non-subscription magazines.
Direct - mail executives see GM's stand as an ominous sign--even if the junk - mail kings did bring it on themselves.
"Why anyone would want *PRO*-2 to close themselves off {from direct mail} *T*-1, a priori, doesn't make any sense," says *T*-3 Michael Bronner of Bronner Slosberg Associates, a Boston directmail firm.
"It smacks of big brotherism.
They're going *-1 to decide what their employees can *RNR*-2 or cannot *RNR*-2 read *T*-3."
The practice is, however, legal in most cases.
Jack Ellis, a U.S. postal inspector in New York, says 0 the Postal Service's only job is *PRO* to deliver the mail to the mail room; once it gets there, a company can do with it what it wishes *T*-1.
The junk - mail titans, *PRO*-1 ever optimistic, are looking for ways around the problem.
So far, they say 0 *?*, it hasn't had any noticeable effect on response rates.
And before it does, they're trying *PRO*-2 to cut back on the clutter that *T*-1 created the situation in the first place.
Among other things, the industry is trying *PRO*-2 to come up with standardized business lists that *T*-1 cut down on duplications.
"We're going *-1 to have *-2 to mail a lot less and a lot smarter," says *T*-3 Jack Miller, president of Quill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., business - to - business mail - order company.
But then again, *PRO* mailing less and smarter won't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway.
New Hyundai Campaign
Hyundai Motor America, *PRO*-1 fighting quality complaints, declining sales and management turmoil, yesterday unveiled its 1990 ad strategy, tagged *PRO* "*PRO*-2 We're Making More Sense Than Ever."
The ad campaign, created * by Saatchi & Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates agency, is an extension of the auto company's "Cars That *T*-1 Make Sense" campaign, which *T*-2 emphasized affordability.
TV ads plugging the company's new V - 6 Sonata and its souped - up Excel subcompact will begin appearing Monday.
One spot shows a Sonata next to a rival midsized car, and an announcer says, "*PRO* Listen to what they're saying *T*-1 about the Hyundai Sonata."
As the announcer reads favorable quotes about the model from Motor Trend and Road & Track magazines, the other car, which *T*-1 is white, slowly turns green.
"No wonder 0 the competition's green with envy," the announcer says *T*-1.
Ad Notes....
ACQUISITION:
EWDB, formed * by the merger of Eurocom and Della Femina McNamee WCRS, said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Vizeversa, an agency in Barcelona.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
HOLIDAY ADS:
Seagram will run two interactive ads *ICH*-4 in December magazines promoting its Chivas Regal and Crown Royal brands.
The Chivas ad illustrates--via a series of pullouts--the wild reactions from the pool man, gardener and others if *PRO* not given *-1 Chivas for Christmas.
The three - page Crown Royal ad features a black - and - white shot of a boring holiday party--and a set of colorful stickers with which readers can dress it up *T*-1.
Both ads were designed *-1 by Omnicom's DDB Needham agency.
Calgon Carbon Corp. said 0 it will build a $40 million *U* plant for *PRO* producing granular activated carbon.
The maker of water - treatment chemicals and equipment said 0 it will select the plant site early next year, and production is expected *-1 to begin in 1991.
In a rare package sale of its real estate, K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led * by New York developer Philip Pilevsky, according to sources familiar with the transaction.
They estimate the value of the transaction at close to $100 million *U*.
K mart officials and Mr. Pilevsky wouldn't comment on the sale.
K mart previously had announced 0 it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday, the same day 0 the real estate deal was completed *-1 *T*-2.
Analysts are estimating 0 third - quarter earnings will drop between 13% and 20% *U* to about 50 to 55 cents per share, compared with 63 cents per share in the year - ago quarter.
It *EXP*-1 is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have *T*-2 on earnings.
K mart developed the centers, which *T*-1 range in size from about 150,000 square feet to just over 250,000 square feet.
Most are anchored *-1 by a K mart store.
The retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer, who *T*-1 plans *PRO*-2 to expand the small centers.
The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail space.
They are spread around the country and include locations in California, Florida, Washington and Arizona.
Mr. Pilevsky, who *T*-1 heads Philips International Holding Corp., a New York - based real estate company, owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant *T*-2.
The company is active in office and residential development in New York.
However, nationally, Mr. Pilevsky controls through limited partnerships about 85 shopping centers with about 17 million square feet.
K mart runs 2,200 K mart stores, primarily in leased facilities.
The company typically sells the centers 0 it develops *T*-1, but has usually sold only one or several at a time.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said 0 it awarded General Dynamics Corp. a $64 million *U* contract *PRO* to launch the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite in June 1990.
CRRES is a joint NASA - Air Force satellite 0 *T*-1 to study the effects of space radiation on micro-electronic components.
NASA said 0 General Dynamics will launch CRRES *PRO*-1 using an Atlas 1 rocket.
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole named a mediator 0 *T*-1 to help *PRO*-2 resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the United Mine Workers and Pittston Co.
W.J. Usery Jr., labor secretary during the Ford administration, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 to mediate talks *PRO* to settle the six - month strike by the UMW.
Previous talks between Pittston, of Greenwich, Conn., and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful.
The union called the strike in April after Pittston refused *PRO*-1 to sign the UMW's national labor pact.
Pittston seeks changes in health and pension benefits, among other things.
No schedule for formal talks was set *-1, but meetings are expected *-2 to begin soon.
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider *PRO*-1 imposing "circuit breakers" *PRO* to halt program trading at volatile times.
Mr. Breeden, in his first testimony to Congress since *PRO* taking the SEC post, said 0 the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge, including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday *T*-1.
After the study, the SEC would be willing *PRO*-1 to consider *PRO*-2 adding new circuit breakers or fine - tuning the current ones, he added 0 *T*-3.
Circuit breakers, designed *PRO* to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements, curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points.
At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop, circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market, *PRO* slowing trading at times.
A circuit breaker that *T*-1 would have closed down the New York Stock Exchange wasn't tripped *-2.
Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer - driven program trading in hopes 0 that would curb "turmoil" in the marketplace.
He argued that program - trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors.
Mr. Breeden didn't reject the proposal.
After the SEC study of the drop is completed *-1, he said 0 *?*, "I'm perfectly happy *PRO*-3 to work with this committee...in *PRO* identifying whether we need other devices," such as a program - trading curb.
Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market - reform bill that the SEC brought *T*-1 to the subcommittee last year under then - chairman David Ruder.
The measure is expected *-1 to move through this Congress.
But the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that *T*-1 would give the agency the right *PRO* to close the markets at times of stress.
Mr. Breeden contended that uncertainty over when the SEC might act *T*-1 could worsen volatility in the markets.
He argued that the current circuit - breaker system allows investors to know "precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur *T*-1 and how long they will last *T*-2."
Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill.
One would force brokerage houses *PRO*-1 to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made * by their holding companies.
Such loans often are used *-2 *PRO* to finance leveraged buy - outs, and the agency is worried *-1 that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms.
He also backed a rule 0 *T*-1 to require large traders *PRO*-2 to report transactions on a systematic basis.
That information, he argued 0 *?*, is critical to *PRO* reconstructing sharp market moves, such as the one nearly two weeks ago.
For all of this year's explosive run - up in stock prices, Renaissance Investment Management Inc.'s computer sat on the sidelines.
Now it's on the fence.
Renaissance, a Cincinnati - based money manager, began *-2 buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion *U* that it oversees *T*-1 for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.
It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought 0 stocks are worth *PRO* owning *T*-1.
Renaissance declined *PRO*-1 to confirm the move, but its stock purchases were thought *-2 to have begun Tuesday, *PRO*-2 timed *PRO*-4 to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned * by the firm.
The other half of its portfolio is expected *-1 to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being.
Wall Street executives said 0 they believed that Renaissance's $900 million *U* buy program was carried *-1 out by PaineWebber Inc.
As *PRO* reported, PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift, although the broker's client was said then *-1 to have been Japanese.
Yesterday, PaineWebber declined comment.
When it owns stocks *T*-2, Renaissance's portfolio typically is composed *-1 of about 60 large - capitalization issues; *PRO*-3 to make *PRO* buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, *PRO*-3 looking for the best package price *PRO* to carry out the trades.
The broker winning the business doesn't charge commissions, but instead profits by *PRO*-1 buying or selling for less than the overall package price.
That puts the broker at risk if it's trying *PRO*-1 to buy stock in a rising market.
In Tuesday's gyrating session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day, but finished with less than a four - point loss.
Renaissance's last portfolio shift, carried out * by Goldman, Sachs & Co., was a highly publicized decision *ICH*-1 last January *PRO* to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills.
The sell signal, which *T*-1 sent a bearish chill through the stock market, came when Renaissance's computer found that stocks were overpriced *-3 compared with bonds and Treasury bills *T*-2.
At the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200.
The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year.
The computer's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance.
Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results, while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills.
So why does Renaissance's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28, where it closed yesterday *T*-1 *T*-3, when it didn't *?* with the Dow at 2200 *T*-2?
"With the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates, stocks are representing a better value all the time," Renaissance President Frank W. Terrizzi said *T*-1 yesterday.
Three - month T - bill yields have fallen to 7.8% from about 9% at the start of the year.
Stock prices, meanwhile, are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached * on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9.
Are those declines enough *PRO* to signal a partial return to stocks?
Mr. Terrizzi won't say specifically, *PRO*-1 explaining that if there was such a move, it would take about three days *PRO* to complete the loose ends of the transaction.
During that time, a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up *PRO*-3 driving up the price of stocks 0 it was trying *PRO*-2 to buy *T*-1 if it tipped its hand.
But everything is relative to Mr. Terrizzi, so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T - bills, even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold *-1 in January *T*-2.
"Our {computer} model has a certain trigger point," he said *T*-1.
When the computer says *PRO* switch *T*-1, Renaissance switches.
The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10 - year history.
Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm's entire portfolio, as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category, *PRO*-1 following a money - management style called *PRO* *PRO*-2 tactical asset allocation.
Competing asset - allocation firms march to their own computer models, so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while Renaissance has sat on the sidelines.
As a result, competitors say 0 Renaissance has been looking for any opportunity *PRO* to return to the stock market, rather than risk *PRO*-2 losing business by *PRO*-3 continuing *-1 to remain fully invested in Treasury bills.
Mr. Terrizzi confirms 0 some clients *ICH*-1 have left Renaissance, but no major ones, and the firm has added new accounts.
This has been a week of stunning events behind what *T*-1 was once called *-2 *PRO*-3 the Iron Curtain and interesting shifts in official American policy toward Moscow.
It has also been a week when inside - the - beltway Washington has had a high old time *PRO*-2 gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion - dollar junket in Japan *T*-1.
The latter may seem *-3 oddly irrelevant, if not downright trivial, given the big picture and the way 0 we have handled it in the nation's capital *T*-2 has done nothing *PRO* to dispel that impression.
In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office 0 he so recently held *T*-1 raises issues about which Americans can actually do something *T*-2.
Our ability *PRO* to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal.
Those events continue *-2 to move at a rate *RNR*-3, and in a direction *RNR*-3, which *T*-1 leave informed commentary--let alone policy--far in their wake.
Earlier this week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by *PRO*-1 invading Afghanistan and, *PRO* to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by *PRO*-1 building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.
Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed *-1 unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader *T*-2.
All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem *-1 to hope *T*-2 and are certainly demanding *T*-2.
Of like, though lesser, note, Secretary of State James Baker put the administration four - square behind perestroika and glasnost, and therefore behind Mikhail Gorbachev, in a pair of carefully reasoned speeches over the past week or so.
And, last but not least, President George Bush now views the changes in Eastern Europe as "absolutely extraordinary" and believes that Mr. Krenz "can't turn the clock back" in East Germany because the change is too inexorable," as he told the New York Times's R.W. Apple Jr.
(In other words, after some highly visible dithering and public airing of differences, the administration has come down on the side of those who *T*-2 believe that what we are witnessing *T*-3 from Berlin to Siberia is a good thing 0 *T*-4 to be welcomed *-1, rather than a new thing 0 *T*-5 to be feared *-6 or viewed *-6 with suspicion.)
All of this is what history will note *T*-2, *PRO* assuming that events don't make it seem *-5 a bad joke, when the record of this time is put *-1 down *T*-4.
For journalists, however, who *T*-1 write what they fondly view *T*-2 as history's first draft, this has also been a week 0 *PRO* to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder *T*-3.
It *ICH*-1 has been a well - paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office.
The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $2 million *U*, the Japanese government has put up just about as much, or so it is reported *T*-2 and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $7 million *U*.
All of which has enabled those of us in Washington who *T*-1 enjoy *PRO*-2 wallowing in such things *PRO*-3 to go into high public dudgeon, as Mr. Apple and I did *?* the other night on ABC's "Nightline."
*PRO*-2 Punching away, we raised what I still think 0 *T*-1 were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow, but at the end of the affair, there was just the tiniest nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target.
As one of his defenders so aptly put it, President Reagan was simply doing what he had always done *T*-1 before his election (and some would say thereafter as well).
He was performing for pay, and why should anyone expect anything more *T*-1?
Primarily because there's more to the matter than Ronald Reagan's personal values, or lack of them.
*PRO* Selling the presidency for a mess of pottage is not so much *ICH*-1 a devaluation from the norm of public life today as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards.
The theme song for the 1980s has been, "Anything Goes," and it has been whistled *-1 with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism.
There are those who *T*-3 say that this is nothing new, that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what *T*-4 is professed *-1 and what *T*-5 is practiced *-2 *T*-6.
There is evidence 0 *T*-1 to support that view.
Eighty - three years ago, William James wrote to H.G. Wells: "The moral flabbiness born * of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success...that, with the squalid cash interpretation put * on the word success, is our national disease."
But if it was the national disease in 1906, it is today the national commonplace.
If there is no law against it, *PRO* do it.
If the law leaves loopholes, *PRO* use them.
If there is no moral prohibition that *T*-1 expressly forbids it, full speed ahead.
And if you are caught *-1 or if people complain, *PRO* simply argue that "everyone does it" or "no one said 0 I shouldn't *?*" and brazen it out.
As a last recourse, when all else has failed *T*-3 and you are pinned *-1 *T*-3, *PRO* apologize for *PRO*-6 having disappointed those who *T*-2 trusted you but deny *PRO*-6 having actually done anything wrong.
(*PRO* See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon *PRO* being sentenced *-1 to prison this Tuesday for *PRO*-2 defrauding the faithful.)
*PRO* Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the *PRO* hang - tough defense of everyone concerned * with the Iran - Contra affair.
The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government "violated norms of behavior" in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.
We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran - Contra, and that apparently isn't going *-1 to change.
For that matter, those long ago identified * as liars are still given *-1 respectful hearings in the press.
That is the key to the current "national disease."
No one seems *-1 willing *PRO*-2 to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law.
The occasional media witch hunt about some politician's private peccadilloes notwithstanding, the general inclination is *PRO* to offer a version of the old refrain, "Who am I *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to judge?"
Thus, no standards, no judgment and no values.
"You are mad because he's making so much money," say *T*-2 President Reagan's defenders.
No, we ought *-2 to be mad because he has demeaned the office 0 we gave him *T*-1, *PRO*-3 enlisting it in the service of private gain, just as we ought *-4 to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth, play disingenuous games about their activities or, *PRO* to steal a phrase, make public service a private trough.
"I'm not going *-2 to be stampeded *-1 into *PRO*-4 overreacting to any of this, President Bush told Mr. Apple *T*-3 in this week's interview.
He was referring to the "absolutely extraordinary" events in Eastern Europe, and it is a defensible position.
But there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s.
We didn't stampede into it, we slithered and slipped down the long slope, and now we have as its quintessential symbol a former president huckstering for a foreign poohbah.
Or perhaps that is a fitting symbol for the United States of 1989: Everything for sale; nothing of real value.
Mr. Carter is a political commentator who *T*-1 heads a television production firm.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the Fed can wipe out inflation without *PRO*-1 causing a recession, but he said *PRO* doing so will inflict some short - term pain and will require *PRO* reducing the federal deficit sharply.
Mr. Greenspan said 0 he and other Fed governors endorse a bill by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.) that *T*-1 would require the Fed *PRO*-2 to pursue policies aimed * at *PRO* eliminating inflation within five years.
"Such a deadline is attainable, but it would have costs," Mr. Greenspan told Rep. Neal's monetary policy subcommittee 0 *T*-1.
The Fed chief opposed a bill - introduced * by Reps. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) and Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.)--that, among other things, *T*-1 would require the Fed *PRO*-2 to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the Fed.
In *PRO*-1 responding to questions, Mr. Greenspan played down reports of tension between the Fed and the Treasury over exchange - rate policy.
"What *T*-2 seem *-3 to be interpreted *-1 as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics," he said *T*-4.
He didn't elaborate.
But the Fed isn't enthusiastic about Treasury efforts *PRO* to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign - exchange markets, and the Treasury is frustrated *-1 at the Fed's reluctance *PRO* to cut interest rates *PRO*-2 to pull down the dollar's value.
Mr. Greenspan said 0 the inflation rate, currently about 4 1/2%, "could be brought *-1 down to levels which *T*-2 are close to zero without *PRO* putting the economy into a recession, but I do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output."
In other words, economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years.
But Mr. Greenspan, who *T*-2 has repeatedly said 0 the Fed's goal is *PRO* to reduce inflation, added that "whatever losses *T*-3 are incurred *-1 in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up *-4 in increased output thereafter."
He warned that Fed efforts *PRO* to conquer inflation would fail--and could produce "a major financial crunch"--unless they are accompanied *-1 by a significant reduction in the federal deficit, which *T*-2 causes the government to borrow heavily.
Rep. Neal's bill originally called on the Fed *PRO*-1 to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter.
He altered the wording *PRO*-1 to win Mr. Greenspan's endorsement.
Even so, his bill is given *-1 little chance of passage.
Reps. Hamilton and Dorgan also have altered their bill, *PRO*-2 dropping a proposal *PRO* to add the Treasury secretary to the 12 - member Fed committee that *T*-1 makes monetary policy.
Instead, the bill simply calls for twice - a - year meetings between the committee and top administration officials.
Even that met with Mr. Greenspan's disapproval because it might subject the Fed "to a more intensely political perspective" and "could risk *PRO* bending monetary policy away from long - term strategic goals."
While each of the Hamilton - Dorgan proposals represents only a small step, together they would erode the Fed's independence, Mr. Greenspan said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Greenspan also said that although he favors *PRO* cutting capital - gains taxes as sound economic policy, he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise embodied * in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and result in higher marginal income tax rates.
The Canadian government plans *PRO*-1 to auction on Tuesday 750 million Canadian dollars (US$639.9 million *U*) of 9.25% bonds due Dec. 1, 1999, the Finance Department said 0 *T*-2.
Proceeds of the issue will be used *-1 for general government purposes.
George L. Manzanec, 53 years old, senior vice president of Texas Eastern Corp., was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 a group vice president of this natural - gas - pipeline concern.
Mr. Manzanec, who *T*-1 succeeds retiring Richard C. Dixon, will be responsible for gas supply, regulatory affairs, and marketing and transportation and exchange for Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., Trunkline Gas Co., Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. and Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.
All of the companies are units of Panhandle Eastern Corp., which *T*-1 acquired Texas Eastern Corp. earlier this year.
The White House has decided *PRO*-2 to push for changes in pesticide law that *T*-1 are designed *PRO*-3 to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation's food supply.
The proposed changes, which *T*-2 are scheduled *-3 to be announced *-1 today, would apply to pesticides and other substances found * on fresh and processed foods, according to federal officials.
Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal.
But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan *PRO* to give more weight to cost - benefit considerations in *PRO*-1 evaluating pesticides.
"It's a tremendous disappointment," said *T*-1 Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"*PRO* Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks *T*-1 is absolutely anathema to the environmental community."
The Bush administration plans *PRO*-2 to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in *PRO*-3 writing specific legislative proposals that *T*-1 embody them.
The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in *PRO* regulating pesticides, with the aim of *PRO* enabling the agency *PRO*-1 to move more quickly.
There already are proposals *ICH*-1 pending in Congress *PRO* to overhaul pesticide law.
Moves *PRO* to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year's Alar scare, when the EPA was harshly criticized *-3 for *PRO*-4 failing *-1 to yank the possible carcinogen, a growth regulator used * *PRO* to make apples redder and crunchier *T*-2.
The agency has since acted *PRO*-1 to remove Alar from the nation's grocery shelves by May 31, 1991, and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped *-2 using the chemical.
In addition, the principles attempt *PRO*-1 to eliminate the so - called Delaney Paradox.
Under the Delaney clause, which *T*-2 applies to processed food, a chemical is banned *-1 if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.
Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that same chemical could be allowed *PRO*-2 to be used *-1 on fresh food if it fell within the EPA's tolerance level.
Among other changes, the White House wants *PRO*-7 to:
-- Give the EPA more flexibility 0 *PRO* to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace *T*-8.
-- Speed up the process for *PRO* removing a pesticide that *T*-3 isn't an imminent hazard.
-- Bar states from *PRO*-9 setting more stringent tolerance levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard.
-- Give the EPA added discretion 0 *PRO* to set "negligible risk" levels for pesticide residues in processed food *T*-10.
Chemicals that *T*-4 exceed these risk levels would be barred *-1, but those that *T*-5 fall below these levels would be allowed *-2.
-- Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that *T*-6 exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of *PRO* doing so outweigh the cost.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that *T*-1 stand as milestones of American business history.)
TAX SHELTERS CALLED *PRO* *PRO*-1 Individual Retirement Accounts, or "IRAs," were created without fanfare on Sept. 2, 1974, but grew beyond expectations as an inducement to personal saving.
That Labor Day, in his first major act after *PRO* succeeding the resigned Richard Nixon as president, Gerald R. Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Pension reform was its main thrust.
Labor and business leaders, *PRO*-1 quoted *-2 at the White House Rose Garden rites, hailed its provisions for *PRO* insuring corporate pension benefits.
IRAs were like stepchildren there.
The IRA's conception is murky.
In 1972, then Treasury Secretary George Shultz, with the key support of Sen. Carl Curtis, sought some form of pensions for the uncovered.
That year a four - man group headed * by William Lieber in the Legislation and Regulations division of the Office of the Chief Counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, was assigned *-1 the task of *PRO* designing a plan.
They used the 1962 Keogh Plan, a pension plan created * by a New York congressman for the self - employed, as a partial model.
This team initially called its new model *PRO*-1 Personal Retirement Account, or "PRA."
But it didn't sing.
So they opted for IRA, *PRO*-2 naming it after Ira Cohen, a brilliant IRS actuary who *T*-1 helped them.
Ira, himself, confirms this account.
IRA rules have been changed *-1 over the years.
One in 1981 raised to $2,000 *U* a year from $1,500 *U* the amount 0 a person could put *T*-1, *PRO*-2 tax - deductible, into the tax - deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans.
This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others.
But in 1986 Congress sharply reduced the number of people who *T*-1 could qualify for its benefits and IRA tax - deductions slowed their roaring growth.
IRA account assets have grown to about $400 billion *U* from $393 billion *U* last year and just $26 billion *U* in 1981.
American Medical International Inc. was dropped *-1 from the health care providers industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index.
The company is being acquired *-1.

Both moves are effective today.
Computer Sciences Corp. said 0 it received a U.S. Postal Service contract that *T*-1 will have a value of at least $33 million *U*.
Computer Sciences will perform data processing work for the Postal Service under the three - year contract, which *T*-2 also includes two additional option years for which compensation hasn't yet been fixed *-1 *T*-3.
Computer Sciences said 0 its work will improve mail - processing efficiency.
For its fiscal year ended March 31, Computer Sciences had revenue of $1.3 billion *U*.
Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year: They got hurt *-1 by *PRO*-1 investing in the highly risky junk bond market, and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money.
These people invested in "leveraged" junk bond mutual funds, the publicly traded funds that *T*-1 make a habit of *PRO* taking out loans *PRO* to buy extra junk.
It's a good strategy in a rising market, where a 25% leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125% of their money working for them *T*-1.
The strategy boosts current yield by *PRO*-1 putting more bonds into the portfolio.
Trouble is, 0 junk bond prices have been weak for months.
Thus, the leverage has amplified the funds' portfolio losses.
And shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered *-1 even harder than the junk bonds 0 they hold *T*-2.
"That's really where the leverage hurt *T*-2," says *T*-3 Thomas Herzfeld, a Miami - based investment manager who *T*-1 specializes in closed - end funds.
"Share prices performed even worse than the funds' asset values because fear has taken hold" in the junk market, he says 0 *T*-1.
Leverage is never a problem for the traditional "open end" mutual funds, which *T*-1 aren't publicly traded *-2 and aren't allowed *PRO*-2 to use leverage at all.
Leverage is used *-1 only by some of the closed - end funds.
The usual maneuver is *PRO* to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock, *PRO* using the proceeds *PRO* to buy additional bonds.
The fallout for investors lately has been painful.
*PRO* Consider the New America High Income Fund.
With a leveraged position of about 45%, the fund's share price has plunged 28.5% so far this year.
That's worse than the price drop sustained * by the bonds in its portfolio, whose total return (bond - price changes plus interest) *T*-1 has amounted to a negative 6.08%.
Such problems may not be over.
Leveraged funds in particular "are still extremely vulnerable, because we're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market," says 0 *T*-1 George Foot, a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates in Northampton, Mass.
Many investors are unaware 0 their funds have borrowed *PRO*-1 to speculate in such a risky market.
"If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold *-1 *T*-2," says *?* Gerald Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago, they might shy away.
In a typical leverage strategy, a fund tries *PRO*-2 to capture the spread between what it costs *T*-1 *PRO* to borrow and the higher return on the bonds 0 it buys *T*-3 with the borrowed money.
If the market surges, holders can make that much more profit; the leverage effectively acts as an interest - free margin account for investors.
But when the market moves against the fund *T*-2, investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified *-1 by the amount 0 the fund is leveraged *T*-3.
Fund managers, for their part, defend their use of leverage.
Carl Ericson, who *T*-1 runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund, says 0 the fund's 25% leverage has jacked up its interest income.
"As long as I am borrowing at 9.9% and each {bond} yields over that, it enhances the yield," he maintains *T*-1.
Mr. Ericson says 0 he tries *PRO*-1 to offset the leverage by *PRO*-2 diversifying the fund's portfolio.
Yet some funds have pulled in their horns.
New America High Income Fund recently said that it plans *PRO*-1 to reduce its leverage position by *PRO*-2 buying back $5 million *U* in preferred stock and notes from investors.
The fund made a similar move earlier this year.
"We are trying *PRO*-2 to increase our flexibility," says *T*-1 Ellen E. Terry, a vice president at Ostrander Capital Management, the fund's investment adviser.
She declined *PRO*-1 to elaborate and wouldn't disclose the fund's recent purchases, sales or cash position.
Ms. Terry did say 0 the fund's recent performance "illustrates what *T*-1 happens in a leveraged product" when the market doesn't cooperate *T*-2.
"When the market turns around *T*-1," she says 0 *?*, "it will give a nice picture" of how leverage can help performance *T*-3.
Several leveraged funds don't want *PRO*-3 to cut the amount 0 they borrow *T*-1 because it would slash the income 0 they pay shareholders *T*-2, fund officials said 0 *T*-4.
But a few funds have taken other defensive steps.
Some have raised their cash positions to record levels.
High cash positions help *PRO*-2 buffer a fund when the market falls *T*-1.
Prospect Street High Income Portfolio, for instance, now holds about 15% in cash and equivalents, nearly quintuple the amount 0 it held *T*-1 earlier this year, says 0 *T*-2 John Frabotta, portfolio co-manager.
He says 0 the fund, which *T*-1 is 40% leveraged, has maintained a "substantial cushion" between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds.
"I don't want *PRO*-1 to be in a position 0 *PRO* to have *PRO* to sell *T*-3," Mr. Frabotta says *T*-2.
Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds *PRO*-1 to raise cash.
At the 50% - leveraged Zenith Income Fund, portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum, Wickes and Horsehead Industries, among others, *PRO*-1 to raise his cash position to a record 15%.
"That's a problem because cash isn't earning us very much money," Mr. Bianchi says *T*-1.
He concedes: "This is the most difficult market that I've been involved *-1 in *T*-2."
Because of the recent junk - market turmoil, the fund is considering *PRO*-1 investing in other issues instead, including mortgage - backed bonds.
"We're looking at the leverage factor every day," says *T*-1 Robert Moore, president of Bernstein - Macaulay Inc., a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and the fund's adviser.
"At some point, if we are unable *PRO*-1 to cover our leveraged cost--and at the moment we're right on it--we're going *-2 to have *-3 to make a move.
The Sept. 25 "Tracking Travel" column advises readers *PRO*-2 to "Charge With Caution When *PRO*-3 Traveling Abroad *T*-1" because credit - card companies charge 1% *PRO*-4 to convert foreign - currency expenditures into dollars.
In fact, this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad.
In contrast to the 1% conversion fee charged * by Visa, foreign - currency dealers routinely charge 7% or more *U* *PRO*-1 to convert U.S. dollars into foreign currency.
On top of this, the traveler who *T*-1 converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion.
At the end of the trip, any unspent foreign exchange will have *-2 to be converted *-1 back into dollars, with another commission due.
The card holder will pay the modest 1% fee only on the amounts actually needed *.
Typically, he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure, and then has another couple of weeks before he has *-1 to pay the bill.
In the meantime, the money can continue *-1 to earn interest for the card holder--often more than 1% during that "float" period alone.

Merksamer Jewelers Inc., a fast - growing jewelry store chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - law protection from creditors, apparently *PRO*-1 to speed a management buy - out of the chain.
The filing, made * yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, follows an agreement *ICH*-1 by L.J. Hooker Corp., Merksamer's owner, *PRO* to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price.
GE Capital Corp., a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co., is providing Merksamer management with $15 million *U* in financing.
L.J. Hooker, based * in Atlanta, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention *PRO* to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain.
L.J. Hooker is owned *-1 by Hooker Corp., Sydney, Australia, which itself *T*-3 is currently being managed *-2 by a court - appointed provisional liquidator.
L.J. Hooker's planned sale of Merksamer is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry.
At that time, Sam Merksamer, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about *-1 to file.
Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy - out.
According to executives close to the situation, Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 *PRO*-1 to speed the sale of the chain.
One executive said 0 an accord signed * by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker's assets.
The Merksamer bankruptcy - law filing appears *-1 to supersede that agreement.
"By *PRO*-3 filing for Chapter 11, the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge *ICH*-2 for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors," said *T*-1 this executive.
"The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker, but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer."
Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, were unavailable for comment.
In a statement, Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a "legal technicality," but also said that "our inability *PRO* to obtain trade credit, *PRO*-1 combined *-2 with a need *PRO* to ensure that our stores were properly stocked *-3 for the Christmas season, necessitated our filing Chapter 11."
The jewelry chain, which *T*-2 is based *-1 in Sacramento, Calif., had revenue of $62 million *U* and operating profit of $2.5 million *U* for the year ended June 30.
A proposed conflict - of - interest policy for federally funded biomedical researchers may thwart many high - technology new ventures, say 0 *T*-1 financiers, researchers and university administrators.
The National Institutes of Health policy would require researchers *PRO*-1 to cut financial ties with health - care businesses--or lose their government money.
Among other concerns, the agency says 0 researchers with business ties are more likely *-1 to falsify findings in order *PRO*-2 to tout new drugs.
As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years, governmental fear of abuse has risen.
But the guidelines could "make it *EXP*-2 impossible *PRO* to commercialize research," says 0 *T*-1 Kenneth Smith, associate provost and vice president for research at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15.
After that, it will make a final decision on the policy.
The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc., a Salem, Mass., start - up, says 0 *T*-1 Robert Daly, a managing partner of TA Associates, a venture - capital firm.
With $2.3 million *U*, he and other investors launched Lithox last year *PRO*-1 to market a gallstone cure being developed * by researchers of the University of California at San Diego.
The researchers, who *T*-2 are being financed *-1 by the Lithox funds, will receive a royalty, or percentage of sales, if their research yields a commercial product.
But because the University of California, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines, Mr. Daly says 0 *T*-1.
The high - tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect *T*-1.
For instance, Commonwealth BioVentures Inc., a venture - capital concern, last month invested $600,000 *U* *PRO*-2 to launch Amira Inc., a Worcester, Mass., concern that *T*-1 will produce pharmaceuticals.
Scientists Rima Kaddurah - Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
While Ms. Kaddurah - Daouk left MIT *PRO*-2 to head Amira, Prof. Schimmel will continue *-1 to work at MIT, serve on Amira's board and own a small equity stake in the company.
The Amira transaction is typical of the way 0 venture - capital firms are approaching the task of *PRO* commercializing biotechnology research *T*-1.
While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned *PRO* to finance its commercialization," says *T*-1 Gloria W. Doubleday of Commonwealth.
"This is the best way 0 *PRO* to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities *T*-1."
But the new guidelines could prevent scientists like Prof. Schimmel from *PRO*-3 being involved *-1 with start - ups such as Amira, venture capitalists point out 0 *T*-2.
And if that happens, the entire process of *PRO* transferring technology to the marketplace could be harmed *-1, they say 0 *T*-2.
The stakes in the controversy are large.
Last year, venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million *U* *PRO*-1 to finance start - up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group.
Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed *PRO*-2 to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties *T*-1.
In many of these deals, "venture capitalists had the inside track," says 0 *T*-1 Lawrence Bock of Avalon Ventures, La Jolla, Calif.
Investors were willing *PRO*-1 to gamble on new technologies because "we had exclusive rights to those technologies," he adds 0 *T*-2.
But under the proposed guidelines, all federally funded research will have *-2 to be reported *-1 publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work.
"Without the exclusivity, most venture capitalists won't have the incentive *PRO* to invest in such deals," Mr. Bock says *T*-1.
Last year, for example, Avalon and others invested $14 million *U* in Athena Neurosciences Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., *PRO*-1 to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain.
But before Athena was able *PRO*-1 to get an exclusive license to the technology, the Federal Register published most of the details, "*PRO* giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance *PRO* to exploit it," Mr. Bock says 0 *T*-2.
Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it.
But, says *ICH*-1 Mr. Bock, "It was a close call."
The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization--and force small companies *PRO*-2 to waste scarce capital, entrepreneurs say 0 *T*-1.
If start - ups can't have early access to research being conducted * at institutions, "we have *-2 to replicate it ourselves or do without the research," says 0 *T*-1 Ruth Emyanitoff, manager of business development at Applied bioTechnology Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., concern.
*PRO* Duplicating research is both costly and time - consuming for a start - up, Ms. Emyanitoff says 0 *T*-1.
For its part, NIH insists that its guidelines "should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use."
Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able *PRO*-2 to develop a way 0 *PRO* to act as brokers for the individual scientists *T*-3, says 0 *T*-4 Katherine Bick, who *T*-1 oversees the huge NIH grants program as its deputy director for extramural research.
NIH staff members believe 0 the guidelines are essential *PRO*-2 to prevent the escalation of problems that *T*-1 have already begun *-3 to surface in scientific ventures.
Not long ago, scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused *-1 of *PRO*-2 falsifying research *PRO*-3 to boost the stock.
Many officials are also concerned about companies getting a "free ride" on government - sponsored research.
A congressional subcommitee has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies exploiting their research.
Among other provisions, the NIH guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from *PRO*-3 holding stock in any company that *T*-2 is affected *-1 by the outcome of their research.
Ms. Bick, the NIH administrator, says 0 the business and scientific community is overreacting to what the agency merely meant *T*-1 to be "ideas for discussion."
The predictions of doom are "premature," she says 0 *T*-1.
But when agencies like the NIH circulate guidelines *T*-1, they've often already formulated policy, veteran scientists say 0 *T*-2.
Indeed, institutions already are taking note.
On Sept. 14, Harvard began *-2 circulating a conflict - of - interest policy statement that, in effect, *T*-1 would follow the NIH guidelines faithfully.
The University of California at San Francisco is also circulating a memo *ICH*-1 among its scientific faculty that *T*-2 will restrict contact with the world of business.
In many other institutions, scientists are shunning contacts with venture investors until the NIH policy is settled *-1.
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Daly, the venture capitalist: "It *EXP*-2 doesn't matter whether they call it *PRO*-3 guidelines or policy.
The damage is already done *-1.
Parker Hannifin Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its three automotive parts divisions to a management - led investor group for $80 million *U*.
The buy - out group is headed *-1 by Paul R. Lederer, president of Parker's automotive group, and includes several other executives of the three divisions.
The units are the Edelmann, Ideal and Plews divisions.
Net sales for the units for the fiscal year ended June 30 were $135.6 million *U*.
Parker officials said 0 the company is selling the units *PRO*-1 to focus on its other businesses.
"Parenthood," this summer's successful and amusing movie about parents and children, apparently was only the beginning.
It seems that every day a new movie *ICH*-1 opens featuring a child coping with a mother's death, or adoption, or aging parents, or pregnancy.
And why not?
Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers--from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen--have taken a cue from Chekhov: When it comes to compelling drama *T*-1, there's no place like home.
Yet too many people working in Hollywood today seem *-2 to suffer from the delusion that the drama played out * in every home will be interesting to people who *T*-1 live somewhere else.
This is not the case.
Some diaries simply aren't worth *PRO* snooping in *?*.
Yet there will be people who *T*-1 will sob at "Immediate Family," a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption.
These are the sensitive souls who *T*-3 can empathize with *RNR*-1 and even enjoy hearing about *RNR*-1 other people's troubles, no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told *-2 *T*-4.
*PRO*-2 Written *-1 by Barbara Benedek, co-author of "The Big Chill," "Immediate Family" takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children.
The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging.
Everyone *ICH*-1 is very nice and good - looking--the adoptive parents (Glenn Close and James Woods) and the teen - age couple who *T*-2 decide *PRO*-3 to give up their baby for adoption (Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon).
Linda and Michael (Ms. Close and Mr. Woods), who *T*-1 seem *-2 to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle.
All of their friends have children and they can't *?*, so now they want a child more than anything--perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment.
The idea of a child - as - required - yuppie - possession must be motivating them, since the wealthy offspring of their friends are shown *-1 to be rude brats, in therapy by age five.
*PRO*-1 Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, Linda and Michael decide *PRO*-1 to adopt.
The actors wear pained expressions *PRO*-1 to indicate their genuine longing for a little one--or maybe they're not - so - subtly commenting on the inadequacy of the script, and Jonathan Kaplan's ("The Accused") dull direction.
Or maybe they are disgusted *-1 by the literal - minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision *T*-3 her thoughts are revealed *-2 by the sound of "I Can See Clearly Now."
The adoption agency insists on *PRO*-1 introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms. Masterson) bus ticket from Ohio.
(Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio *T*-1?
I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.)
Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated.
Everyone falls in love with everyone else.
There is some pain, when Lucy has the baby and "didn't know 0 she would feel like this" and wants *PRO*-1 to keep the baby *T*-2.
But in the end, everything turns out for the best, in the film makers' warped view.
Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field, the baby goes where the money is *T*-1.
At the other end of the life cycle is *T*-1 "Dad," Gary David Goldberg's adaptation of the William Wharton novel.
This picture is about a middle - aged son who *T*-1 makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by *PRO*-3 waiting *PRO*-2 to cement it until just before the old man dies.
The glib emotional style 0 Mr. Goldberg has perfected *T*-1 on television's "Family Ties" doesn't benefit from magnification.
His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days.
They pause only *PRO*-1 to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction, like tourists cataloging the sights 0 they've seen *T*-2 from the window of a bus.
Not even Jack Lemmon's expert doddering makes this trip worth *PRO*-1 taking.
So it *EXP*-2's entirely possible that "*PRO* Look Who *T*-1's Talking" isn't as entertaining as it seems *?* in comparison to the turgid other films opening now.
But by comparison, this fluffy comedy seems like a gem.
It starts with conception, *PRO* taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view.
Bruce Willis's best attribute as an actor is his coy, lazy voice, and that's all 0 you get *T*-1 of him here, *PRO* speaking for the baby.
Finally, there is one family movie that *T*-1 quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion--only its stars are bears.
For the second time, in a movie called *PRO* "*PRO*-2 The Bear," French director Jean - Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be *T*-1.
("Quest for Fire" was the first time.)
*PRO* To be sure, one wonders what kind of man *ICH*-6 *T*-1 is this, who *T*-2 feels compelled *PRO*-4 to try *PRO*-5 to understand the most primitive longing and instinct in a way that *T*-3 requires the most sophisticated appreciation of visual storytelling.
Supposedly, he proposed the movie to his producer, Claude Berri, in four lines:
"An orphan bear cub.
A big solitary bear.
Two hunters in the forest.
The animals' point of view."
But then, even a great many words couldn't summarize the extraordinary pull of this movie about an orphaned bear who *T*-1 adopts a parent.
Video Tip:
One of the best movies about the child - parent thing in recent years was "*PRO* Raising Arizona," the 1987 Coen brothers' comedy that *T*-1 definitely was not about the folks next door.
The Canadian government, with a view to *PRO* becoming more politically active in Latin America, is expected *-1 to announce tomorrow its application *PRO* to join the Organization of American States, a Washington - based regional agency.
The expected Canadian move has been welcomed *-1 by the Bush administration even though Canada has opposed such U.S. actions as the trade embargo against Cuba, the invasion of Grenada and the military support for Nicaragua's Contra guerrillas.
Latin American countries have long urged Canada *PRO*-3 to join the OAS in the hopes that it would be a counterweight to the U.S., which for many years *T*-1 tended *-2 to dominate the 32 - nation organization.
Even though the U.S. also has supported Canadian membership, it hasn't been a Washington priority.
"The fact that we might not side with the Americans may be a reason why Canada's membership in the OAS hasn't been, over the years, an item high on the U.S. agenda *T*-2," said *T*-1 Allan Gotlieb, former Canadian ambassador to the U.S. .
The Canadian application is expected *-3 to be announced *-1 in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who *T*-2 is attending a centenary celebration of Costa Rican democracy.
"Canada has a larger and more beneficial role 0 *PRO* to play *T*-1 in the hemisphere," Mr. Mulroney said *T*-2 recently.
Some Canadian political commentators have opposed Canada's joining what they see *T*-1 as a U.S. - dominated organization.
"Canada could do plenty of things *PRO*-3 to get serious about Latin America without *PRO* running the risk of *PRO* getting caught *-2 in the cross fire" between the U.S. and Latin American members of the OAS, said 0 *T*-1 Jeffrey Simpson, a columnist in Toronto's Globe & Mail newspaper.
Canada, at times, could be an awkward OAS partner for the U.S. if its United Nations voting record is an indication.
In U.N. General Assembly votes last year, Canada voted the same as the U.S. only 63% of the time.
France voted the same as the U.S. 76% of the time, West Germany 79% and Britain 83%.
Larry Birns, director of the Washington - based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group, said that Latin American countries would be "profoundly disappointed" if Canada were *-1 to follow the U.S. lead in the OAS.
"Latin Americans see Canada as a non-interventionist power that *T*-1 respects their sovereignty," he said *T*-2.
The OAS, which *T*-1 tries *PRO*-2 to promote peace and economic development within the Americas, is attempting *PRO*-3 to find a settlement of the current Panama political crisis.
Cuba has been suspended *-1 from OAS membership, but the organization's members are discussing Cuba's reinstatement.
Furukawa Electric Co. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to increase production of computer memory devices on a large scale in the U.S. and Japan.
As part of the move, its affiliated U.S. company, International Components Technology Corp., purchased a Mexican plant formerly belonging to KSI Disc Products Inc.
The price wasn't disclosed *-1.
Together with two existing plants in the U.S., Furukawa said 0 it will expand its current local monthly production of memory disks to 1.4 million sheets from 800,000.
In Japan, Furukawa said 0 it will raise production at a plant outside Tokyo to 300,000 sheets monthly from 100,000.
Furukawa said 0 the U.S. market is strengthening as related computer technology gains in sophistication and quality.
Investors poured $2.8 billion *U* more into money - market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields.
Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked * by IBC / Donoghue's Money Fund Report jumped to $351.2 billion *U* in the week ended Tuesday, the Holliston, Mass. - based newsletter said 0 *T*-1.
Assets soared $4.5 billion *U* in the previous week.
Meanwhile, the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point, the largest drop since midsummer.
The average seven - day compound yield, which *T*-2 assumes that dividends are reinvested *-1 and that current rates continue for a year, fell to 8.47%, its lowest since late last year, from 8.55% the week before, according to Donoghue's.
"Lower yields are just reflecting lower short - term interest rates," said *T*-1 Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
Money funds invest in such things as short - term Treasury securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, all of which *T*-1 have been posting lower interest rates since last spring.
Individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short - term instruments.
The yield on six - month Treasury bills sold * at Monday's auction, for example, was just 7.77%.
The average yield on six - month CDs of $50,000 or less *U* at major banks was 7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service.
One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment *T*-1 is by *PRO* extending the maturities of their investments, so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period.
The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue's follows *T*-1 increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days, its longest since August.
"They're anticipating further declines in rates and they're going *-2 to get them, slowly," said *T*-1 Walter Frank, chief economist for the Donoghue Organization, publisher of Money Fund Report.
Average maturity was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when short - term interest rates were moving steadily upward *T*-1.
The average seven - day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62% in late April.
The highest - yielding funds are still above 9%.
The top - performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, with a seven - day compound yield of 9.45%.
The fund invests heavily in dollar - denominated money - market securities overseas.
It is currently waiving management fees, which *T*-1 contributes to the higher yield.
The average seven - day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14% from 8.21%, Donoghue's reported 0 *T*-1.
The average 30 - day simple yield slid to 8.22% from 8.26%, and the average 30 - day compound yield fell to 8.56% from 8.60%.
Financial markets took a midweek break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly, bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.94 points to 2653.28 in moderate trading.
Long - term Treasury bonds rose slightly despite the arrival on the market of $4.52 billion *U* in 30 - year bonds offered * by the Resolution Funding Corp. as part of the government's bailout of the savings and loan industry.
The dollar was barely changed against the West German mark and up marginally against the Japanese yen.
Yesterday's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the rearing and plunging of stock prices Tuesday after the proposed buy - out of UAL Corp. once again collapsed.
Traders said 0 the stock market's lurching moves have prompted many investors *PRO*-1 to head for the sidelines until it regains some semblance of stability.
Although bond prices weren't as volatile *ICH*-1 on Tuesday trading as stock prices, traders nevertheless said 0 action also was much slower yesterday in the Treasury market.
Bond investors paid close attention to comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who *T*-1 was testifying before a congressional hearing, but weren't able *PRO*-2 to extract many clues about the future course of the Fed's monetary policy.
Many analysts are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year.
Investors now are awaiting today's release of the preliminary estimate of third - quarter gross national product.
Economists predict 0 the report will show economic growth of about 2.5% in the third quarter, which *T*-1 would have little effect on financial markets.
But an unexpected deviation either way could roil bond and currency markets.
In major market activity:
Stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 155.7 million shares.
But advancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of decliners 784 to 700.
Bond prices inched higher.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year issue rose less than an eighth of a point, or less than $1.25 *U* for each $1,000 *U* of face amount.
The yield on the issue stood at 7.88%.
The dollar was virtually unchanged.
In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted *-1 at 1.8353 marks and 141.52 yen, compared with 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen Tuesday.
Two West German chemical companies announced steps that apparently *T*-1 are designed *PRO*-2 to boost the chemical industry's standing among environmental groups and the general public.
Hoechst AG's Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said 0 the company wants *PRO*-1 to have a substitute product 0 *T*-2 to completely replace ozone - damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995.
In April, Hoechst, the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany, said 0 it wanted *PRO*-1 to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993.
Mr. Hilger said 0 Hoechst will invest 50 million marks ($27.2 million *U*) in a plant *PRO* to make a substitute product 0 it has developed *T*-2 that it says 0 *T*-3 is unchlorinated.
The company hopes 0 the new plant, likely *PRO* to be built *-1 in Frankfurt, will be able *PRO*-2 to produce 10,000 tons a year.
This year, Hoechst will produce about 62,000 tons of CFCs in factories in Frankfurt, Spain and Brazil.
Of Hoechst's 40.9 billion marks in group sales in 1988, 200 million marks *T*-1 came from sales of CFCs.
Also, BASF AG, another large chemicals company, said 0 it formed a separate division that *T*-1 will study the environmental impact of plastics and will investigate all possibilities of *PRO* recycling plastics.
Alvin W. Trivelpiece, director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tenn., was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this optical - products concern.
Mr. Trivelpiece, 58 years old, succeeds William Bolger, who *T*-1 died in August.
Richard Breeden hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone.
It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But the lack of lines became painfully apparent.
As the stock market lurched into a 190 - point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC--from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line *T*-2, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected *-1 *T*-3, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves *T*-4.
With other anxious calls pouring in, he recalls *?*, "I'd either have *-2 to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary's desk."
It won't happen again.
Now there are more lines connected * to the chairman's office, and the market - monitoring computer has been moved *-1 next to his desk.
It's all part of a new "command center."
The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. Breeden's stance as the nation's top securities regulator.
Like his predecessor, David Ruder, he was faced *-1 with a crisis in the stock markets soon after *PRO*-1 coming into office.
But unlike Mr. Ruder, who during the 1987 crash *T*-2 damaged himself by *PRO*-4 saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed *-1, Mr. Breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage, *PRO*-3 using it *PRO*-5 to further his agenda for the SEC.
In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190 - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average--the second - largest ever--as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability *PRO* to better monitor leveraged buy - out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.
*PRO*-1 A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings - and - loan bailout, Mr. Breeden wants *PRO*-1 to have the SEC regulate securities issued * by banks and S&Ls.
More broadly, he wants *PRO*-1 to "modernize" regulation by *PRO*-2 eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by *PRO*-2 helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market.
He believes 0 the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy - outs, an area 0 the SEC doesn't regulate *T*-1 directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress *T*-2.
Also unlike Mr. Ruder, Mr. Breeden appears *-1 to be in a position 0 *PRO* to get somewhere with his agenda *T*-2.
As a former White House aide who *T*-1 worked closely with Congress, he is savvy in the ways of Washington.
What *T*-1's more, the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity *PRO* to obtain his own majority on the five - member commission, *PRO* enabling him *PRO*-3 to avoid the dissension that *T*-2 frustrated his predecessor.
But Mr. Breeden, a 39 - year - old securities lawyer, has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets.
For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high - risk, high - yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks.
He may be waiting *PRO*-1 to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules.
He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer.
Mr. Breeden's selection will be scrutinized *-1 as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to *PRO* continuing the SEC's high - profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street.
Congress seems *-1 likely *PRO*-2 to let the new chairman have his way for a while.
Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from *PRO* working on the thrift - bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm.
Indeed, during Mr. Breeden's confirmation hearing last month, senators asked him *PRO*-1 to introduce his children three separate times--more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job.
These days, Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind - the - scenes role in *PRO* monitoring the Friday - the - 13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session.
As a regulator charged * with *PRO*-2 restoring investor confidence, Mr. Breeden avoided *PRO*-1 making market - jarring comments and worked *PRO*-1 to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies.
Not everyone has jumped on the Breeden bandwagon, however.
Some in Washington contend that it's too soon *PRO* to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC.
"I don't think 0 this was a real test," says *T*-1 one congressional aide.
"It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is 0 if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference."
For some at the SEC, an agency that *T*-1 covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.
They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie.
They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when *PRO* told *-2 *PRO*-3 to do so by the White House *T*-1.
But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness *PRO* to run the SEC his way.
During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points.
*PRO*-3 Stunned *-2, Mr. Breeden turned to his market - monitoring computer, which by then *T*-1 was next to his desk.
It showed the DJIA up 30 points.
SEC staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock - market service, Quotron, had miscalculated the industrial average.
Mr. Breeden instructed SEC staffers *PRO*-1 to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number.
"It was the plunge that *T*-1 didn't happen," he says *T*-2.
Mr. Breeden also is trying *PRO*-1 to use a far more catastrophic event--the California earthquake--*PRO*-2 to move another rule change past Congress.
That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange's stock options - trading operation, *PRO* forcing those options to be switched *-1 to other exchanges temporarily.
Though *PRO*-1 obscure to most investors, the question of whether *PRO* to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in Congress, mainly because regional exchanges fear 0 the change could bankrupt them.
Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing.
Mr. Breeden, *PRO*-1 not missing a chance *PRO* to press his agenda, cited the earthquake.
That event, he contended 0 *?*, simply shows the "vulnerability" of *PRO* having listings on only one exchange.
National Convenience Stores Inc., *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to shake the doldrums in the convenience - store business, said 0 it will rearrange the merchandise in all of its stores in the next 18 months *PRO*-3 to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores.
As part of the plan, the Houston - based company's 1,100 Stop 'N Go stores will be refocused *PRO*-1 to target black, Hispanic, upscale or core middle - class customers.
Stores in upper - income neighborhoods, for instance, will carry high - priced wines, publications such as Vanity Fair, gourmet pasta sauces, oat bran cereals and Weight Watchers and Pritikin products.
Stores in Hispanic areas will stock an assortment of Spanish - language magazines, Mexican cooking items and candies.
Stores in the company's core middle - class market will get more frozen and quick - 0 *PRO* to - prepare *T*-1 foods and a greater selection of bottled water.
V.H. Van Horn, National Convenience president and chief executive officer, said 0 the move reflects the company's realization that the industry's poor performance stems from its failure *PRO* to give customers what they want *T*-1--rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24 - hour grocery stores.
"Convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences," he said *T*-1 in a speech at the company's annual shareholders meeting.
Analysts and competitors said 0 the move reflects a growing need *ICH*-2 by the stores *PRO* to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue - collar worker who *T*-1 pops into a convenience store for a sandwich, cigarettes, soda or beer.
"There are an increasing number of people out there who *T*-1 are time - poor," said *T*-3 Chris Vroom, retail analyst with Alex . Brown & Sons of Baltimore.
"Those are primarily white - collar workers, a customer segment that *T*-1 has historically proved *-2 elusive for convenience stores."
National Convenience's move is likely *-2 to be echoed *-1 by other chains, though analysts note that Southland Corp., owner of 7 - Eleven stores, and Circle K Corp. are too debt - heavy *PRO* to roll out such an extensive effort.
Still, Southland said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years, and that the company has begun *-1 to follow suit.
For instance, Southland has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh sandwiches in some outlets.
Several months ago, it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores, a spokeswoman said 0 *T*-1.
"We certainly see an increasing trend toward that," she added *T*-1.
National Convenience said 0 it has tested its new merchandise mix in 100 stores, with favorable results.
Analysts said 0 the company's effort will be helped *-1 by its decision *ICH*-4 last year *PRO* to put point - of - sale scanners in 200 stores, *PRO* allowing National Convenience to quickly track items that *T*-2 are selling and those that *T*-3 aren't *?*.
*PRO*-2 To promote its new strategy, National Convenience said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to spend about $12 million *U* on advertising for the year ending June 30, up from about $10 million *U* in fiscal 1989.
Eugene A. Miller, 52 years old, was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this electric utility company, *PRO* filling a vacancy.
He is president and chief executive officer of Comerica Inc. in Detroit.
The recent bids for United and American Airlines have led Congress to move with supersonic speed *PRO*-1 to protect incumbent airline managements.
The House is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to vote today on an anti-airline - takeover bill that *T*-1 would block, for up to 50 days, any bid for 15% or more *U* of a U.S. airline, even a straight cash purchase.
Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner, who earlier *T*-1 fueled the anti-takeover fires with his quasi-xenophobic attacks on foreign investment in U.S. carriers, now says 0 the bill would further disturb the jittery capital markets.
Texas Rep. Steve Bartlett, who *T*-1 has 40,000 American Airlines workers in his district, says 0 the bill is "good politics, but bad law."
It *EXP*-1 is ironic that at a time when America's partial airline deregulation is being emulated *-2 by governments from New Zealand to Ethiopia *T*-4, so many in Congress favor an incumbent - protection program for airlines that *T*-3 would be more appropriate for the Soviet airline, Aeroflot.
The average unemployment rate in the 15 biggest industrialized democracies was steady in August at the 6.1% rate of the two previous months, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said 0 *T*-1.
The August rate was 0.6 percentage point lower than in the like month a year earlier, *PRO* reflecting the pickup of activity in the 15 countries.
The OECD said that most of the improvement occurred in the second half of last year; since February of this year, unemployment has been steady at around 6.2% of the labor force.

The Soviet State Bank announced a 90% devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions, in an apparent attempt *PRO* to curb the nation's rapidly growing black market for hard currency.
The measure, which *T*-1 will take effect next Wednesday, will create a two - tier exchange rate.
Commercial transactions will continue *-2 to be based *-1 on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar.
But for Soviet citizens who *T*-1 travel abroad for business or tourism, the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar.
Tass news agency said 0 the devaluation also will apply to foreigners' transactions.
But it didn't elaborate, and it *EXP*-1 remains unclear how far Western tourists and foreigners living in Moscow will be allowed *PRO*-3 to benefit from the sweeping rate cut *T*-2.
The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market.
As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade, the discrepancy has become ever greater.
Western tourists in the Soviet Union who *T*-2 could exchange a dollar--albeit illegally--for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered *-1 15 rubles or more.
Even at such rates, black marketeers have been able *PRO*-1 to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here.
They use dollars *PRO*-1 to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark - up.
The going rate for a small personal computer that *T*-1 costs about $2,000 *U* in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles.
Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more.
With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little 0 *PRO* to spend them on *T*-1, Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black - market prices for such goods--but they buy them anyway.
Moscow has already tacitly admitted that the ruble isn't worth much, *PRO*-2 announcing in August that it will pay Soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow *T*-1 in excess of state - plan quotas.
"The absurdity of the official rate should seem *-2 obvious to everyone," the afternoon newspaper Izvestia wrote *T*-1 in a brief commentary on the devaluation.
The State Bank's move is part of a drive *PRO* to iron out exchange - rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward *PRO* making the ruble convertible--a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say 0 *T*-1 is still far away.
Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks, but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise.
"It's much bigger than we expected *?*," said *T*-2 one German banker, who *T*-1 asked *PRO* not to be named *-3.
The next step, which *T*-1 could have a larger effect on businesses, will come early next month, when the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs is *-3 to hold its first auction of foreign currency *T*-2.
Soviet companies needing Western currencies *PRO* to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able *PRO*-2 to submit bids.
Plans for the auction, which *T*-2 was supposed *-3 to take place last spring and become a regular event, have been thwarted *-1 by a lack of hard currency.
Soviet firms that *T*-1 hold some are unwilling *PRO*-2 to part with it, and joint ventures aren't yet allowed *PRO*-3 to participate.
The Kremlin also has been unwilling *PRO*-1 to provide hard currency for the auction, *PRO*-1 using a lot of it instead *PRO*-2 to finance emergency imports of consumer goods.
If foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new, better exchange rate, that would enable the State Bank *PRO*-1 to increase its dollar reserves and would mop up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time.
But the amounts 0 they exchange *T*-2 may be limited *-1; most Soviet hotels, for example, demand payment in hard currency from Western visitors.
Unless other rules are changed *-1, the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people 0 it is primarily meant *-4 to help *T*-3: Soviets who *T*-2 travel abroad.
Over the past three years, thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions *PRO*-1 to get their first taste of life abroad.
But under current rules, they are allowed *PRO*-1 to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip.
At the new rate, that would give them about $30 *U* 0 *PRO* to travel on *T*-1.
It *EXP*-2 isn't yet clear whether the 200 - ruble limit will be lifted *-3.
If it isn't *?*, the black market for dollars probably will continue *-1 to thrive.

Marsh & McLennan Cos. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire the rest of Gradmann & Holler, a leading West German insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a 15% stake *T*-2 for 15 years.
The transaction, for cash and stock, would represent the biggest European takeover since 1980 for New York - based Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker.
It's also the first major sign of the long - awaited consolidation in the European insurance industry as the European Community Commission moves toward a single market by 1992.
Protective barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer, when big industrial companies will be able *PRO*-2 to buy insurance from carriers in any other EC country for the first time *T*-1.
That's why "we have been working hard *PRO*-3 to develop a single, more unified presence in Europe *T*-1," said 0 *T*-2 A.J.C. Smith, Marsh & McLennan's president, at a London news conference yesterday.
Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks ($136.4 million *U*) and 350 million marks *ICH*-1 for the rest of Gradmann & Holler, or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm's estimated earnings.
"This is paying a big price *PRO* to maintain their virility as the world's leading insurance broker," said *T*-1 Philip Olsen, an analyst at Kitcat & Aitken, a U.K. brokerage firm.
Earlier this year, New York Life Insurance Co. agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Windsor Group Ltd., a first step toward *PRO* establishing a presence in the European market ahead of 1992.
But most U.S. insurers haven't rushed *PRO*-2 to change the way 0 they do business in Europe *T*-3 because they believe 0 the European market will still be dominated *-1 by a handful of domestic companies.
Under the proposed combination, Marsh & McLennan would gain a majority stake in Gradmann & Holler that *T*-1 would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85%.
The three managing general partners would receive a "significant" number of Marsh & McLennan shares, said 0 *T*-2 Walther L. Kiep, a partner who *T*-1 would also join Marsh & McLennan's board.
Mr. Kiep said 0 he sought the combination because "all our large clients in Germany are becoming European companies or multinational companies and they expect an insurance broker" to serve them as well *ICH*-1 in Paris as in Germany.

One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper - and - crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett.
And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden "artwork" in the downtown complex.
South Gardens, 0 as the Bartlett scheme is called *-1 *PRO*-3 *T*-2, will occupy the last 3.5 acres of open space at the southwest tip of Manhattan.
It could cost taxpayers $15 million *U* *PRO* to install *?* and BPC residents $1 million *U* a year *PRO* to maintain *?*.
*PRO* Created *-2 by an artist who *T*-1 flaunts her ignorance of plants and gardens, South Gardens, as *PRO*-4 now planned *-3, will die from congestive garden design.
Ms. Bartlett's previous work, which *T*-1 earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens as its nominal subject.
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think 0 she had a literal green thumb.
(Ms. Bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article.)
Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life."
And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a New York State public benefit corporation: "The only thing 0 I was interested in *PRO*-1 doing *T*-3 was a very complicated garden, which *T*-2 would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive 0 *PRO* to maintain *T*-4."
*PRO*-3 Undeterred, the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect Alexander Cooper, who *T*-1 claimed 0 he had never visited *RNR*-2, much less built *RNR*-2, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape.
I view this as a building."
The third principal in the South Gardens adventure did have garden experience.
The firm of Bruce Kelly / David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden.
The BPCA called its team *PRO*-1 a "stunning" collaboration.
After four years, though, the South Gardens design is 100% uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett.
She has done little more than *PRO* recycle her standard motifs--trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles--and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two - dimensional works for a gallery wall.
But for South Gardens, the grid was *-1 to be a 3 - D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them.
In a letter to the BPCA, kelly / varnell called this "*PRO*-1 arbitrary and amateurish."
The landscape architects were expelled *-1 from the garden in July.
All the while, Ms. Bartlett had been busy at her assignment, serene in her sense of self - tilth.
As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design: "I have designed a garden, *PRO*-1 not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip."
Moreover, she proclaimed that "landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years" in the design of open space.
And she further stunned her listeners by *PRO*-2 revealing her secret garden design method: *PRO* Commissioning a friend to spend "five or six thousand dollars...on books that I ultimately cut up *T*-1."
After that, the layout had been easy.
"I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail."
Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in *PRO* giving in to the client "because I don't think 0 you can do watered - down versions of things."
(This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim.)
Last year the public was afforded *-1 a preview of Ms. Bartlett's creation in a tablemodel version, at a BPC exhibition.
The labels were breathy: "Within its sheltering walls is *T*-1 a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design...a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard...organized * in a patchwork of 50 - by - 50 - foot squares *PRO* to form ` rooms'...here and there are *T*-3 simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort 0 *PRO* to drag around *T*-2....
At the core of it all is *T*-1 a love for plants."
Plant lovers who *T*-1 studied the maquette were alarmed.
They looked at the miniature and saw a giant folly.
Ms. Bartlett's little rooms left little room for plants or people.
Kelly / Varnell had put South Gardens' carrying capacity at four people per room, or about 100 humans overall.
This mincemeat of tiny gridlocked squares was inspired *-1 by the artist's own digs: "My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room."
Inside the grid were *T*-1 24 of these plant cells jammed *PRO* *PRO*-2 full of clutter.
One she made *T*-1 into a topiary rec room, replete with plants shaped * into a Barcalounger, TV, piano and chairs.
In another, she requisitioned topiary MX missile cones--costing $10,000 *U* each--in heights up to 20 feet.
Another she stuffed *T*-1 with eight "rectilinear hedges" for a topiary geometry lesson in the right - angling of plants.
In the herbal lounge she specified a "plaid knot garden" decor.
She ordered the foyer done *-1 in a different plaid planting, and made the landscape architects study a book on tartans.
In one garden roomette she implanted a 43 - foot square glass cube meant *PRO* to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a "zinc sink," a "huge fishbowl with carp" and a "birdcage with cockatoos."
Next door she put a smaller plaid - floored glass house, where, she suggested 0 *T*-2, a flat of strawberries might be displayed *-1 in the dead of winter *T*-3 *T*-4.
In another compartment called *PRO* *PRO*-3 the Linden Bosque, 62 linden trees were *-2 to be crowded *-1 together at killing intervals of 10 or 16 feet.
(Lindens need about 36 feet.)
One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full - time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists.
Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested *PRO* calling upon "semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance."
Furthermore, she had insisted on paths so narrow (five to eight feet) *RNR*-1 and hedge corners so square *RNR*-1 that standard maintenance equipment--trucks or cherry pickers--couldn't maneuver.
Then, *PRO*-1 to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms, Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls (brick, lattice, hedge) eight to 10 feet tall, *PRO*-1 casting her interiors into day - long Stygian shade.
It *EXP*-2 was hard *PRO* to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without *PRO* decking the walls in a Christmas - like array of Gro - Lites *T*-1.
Finally, *PRO*-1 flouting the BPCA's wishes *PRO* to continue the popular two - mile riverside Esplanade, prized * for its expansive views of New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall.
She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront, *PRO* blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river.
(Within her garden, she has decreed a waterfall, a rill, ponds and other costly, trivial waterworks beside the Hudson.)
While the model was still on view, Manhattan Community Board 1 passed a resolution against South Gardens.
The Parks Council wrote the BPCA that this "too ` private'...exclusive," complex and expensive "enclosed garden...belongs in almost any location but the waterfront."
Lynden B. Miller, the noted public garden designer who *T*-1 restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden 0 she was designing *T*-2 for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "Bryant Park, as *PRO*-3 designed *-4 in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped.
By *PRO*-1 removing the hedges and some walls, the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up.
It seems to me 0 the BPCA plan has the potential of *PRO* making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants."
The three urban horticulture experts with Cornell Cooperative Extension weighed in with a letter to the BPCA that *T*-1 began: "We feel that the garden is horticulturally doomed *-2."
They then addressed the decidedly "questionable safety of...a complex garden of endless hiding places.
The 8 ft. hedges which *T*-1 obstruct views in and out of small ` rooms' insure...that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime."
(At Harvard, Ms. Bartlett had declared: "There are going *-1 to be problems with safety ...
I'm not going *-1 to address questions of safety!")
Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. Bartlett's South Gardens design somehow continues on, *PRO*-2 seemingly impervious to reason, *PRO*-2 stalled *-1 only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications.
BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes *PRO*-2 to negotiate a seawall that *T*-1 could "be significantly more visually permeable."
And by *PRO*-1 substituting yet another landscape architect, Nicholas Quennell, he insists 0 he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while *PRO*-2 still preserving the "artistic vision" of a "truly great artist."
After four years of no progress in this direction, it *EXP*-1 is doubtful 0 any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible.
(Mr. Quennell has said 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to go with the grid, regardless.)
There is still time, however, 0 for Gov. Mario Cuomo or Fabian Palomino, chairman of the BPCA board, to prevent this topiary "Tilted Arc *T*-1."
These statesmen might take counsel from William Robinson, author of "The English Flower Garden"--the gardener's bible since 1883--who *T*-1 seems *-2 to have had a Jennifer Bartlett in mind when he wrote: "Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when *PRO* applying his ` designs' to the garden *T*-4 *T*-3....
It is this adapting of absurd ` knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has *-4 to be made *-1 *T*-3 that *T*-2 leads to bad and frivolous design--wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants.
Duriron Co. said 0 it has agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Automax Inc., a Cincinnati maker of control accessories for industrial valves.
Terms weren't disclosed *-2, but Duriron said 0 the deal will be completed *-1 through an exchange of stock.
Closely held Automax has annual sales of about $10 million *U*.
Duriron, a maker of pumps, valves and other controls, said 0 the acquisition won't impact its 1989 profit.
Office Market Weakens In Overbuilt Northeast
THE NORTHEAST office market is feeling serious aftereffects of the giddy overbuilding of the 1980s.
Foreclosures and other signs of financial distress, *PRO*-1 most often associated *-2 with the real estate market in the Southwest, are surfacing in the suburban office market of the once thriving Northeast.
Some projects *ICH*-1 are now in the hands of lenders, including a 425,000 - square - foot office facility in Little Falls, N.J.
The owners of a 32 - acre hotel and office complex in King of Prussia, Pa., have advertised for new financing.
Rising office vacancy rates in Fairfield County, Conn., have builders and bankers scrambling *PRO*-1 to restructure loans.
And in suburban Boston, developers are bracing for cutbacks in the computer industry, a major user of office space.
Many troubled properties haven't been foreclosed on *-2 and are hard 0 *PRO* to identify *T*-4, says 0 *T*-3 Albert I. Berger, who *T*-1 heads the Secaucus, N.J., office of Helmsley - Spear Inc., a real estate brokerage.
Owners are voluntarily--and quietly--turning over properties to lenders through "deeds in lieu of foreclosure."
Often, developers stay on as property manager.
Real estate analyst Lloyd Lynford says 0 the Northeast's distress is masked *-1 by relatively low vacancy rates.
But in today's overbuilt market, tenants have many choices and are negotiating low rents that *T*-1 squeeze building owners.
On average, Mr. Lynford says 0 *?*, it *EXP*-2 now takes three to 3 1/2 years *PRO* to fill new office space, compared with 2 1/2 years in 1988.
Beverly Hills Comes To Suburban Tokyo
WHY SHOULD the Japanese cross the Pacific *PRO*-3 to buy American real estate when they can simply recreate it at home *T*-1 *T*-2?
Tokyu Development Corp. is spending $500 million *U* *PRO*-1 to build American - style luxury homes *ICH*-3 in suburban Tokyo with rarely seen back yards, front yards, swimming pools and tennis courts.
The Japanese company hired Richardson Nagy Martin, a Newport Beach, Calif., architectural firm, *PRO*-2 to design what the Japanese press has dubbed *T*-1 "*PRO*-3 the Beverly Hills of Tokyo."
Instead of Japan's typical small homes clustered * on narrow streets with no sidewalks, the new "One Hundred Hills" development will offer 65 houses on half - acre lots.
That's more than 10 times the usual housing site size.
Buyers with $6 million *U* 0 *PRO* to spend *T*-1 can select from 11 designs, including a Mediterranean - inspired California style, a traditional Yankee look and designs inspired * by Midwestern architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
There are spacious living rooms and baths, plus a master grandparents suite and a foyer for *PRO* removing shoes 0 *T*-1 to suit Japanese life styles.
Exteriors are faced *-1 with brick, wood or stone, but the homes are made *-2 of steel - reinforced concrete.
"We were disappointed 0 we couldn't use wood," says *?* architect Walter J. Richardson, "but the Japanese only want stronger materials."
At $1,000 *U* per square foot, the Japanese want the feeling of indestructibility, he explains 0 *?*, not to mention protection from possible earthquake damage.
Housing Developers Try Brand - Name Buildings
RESIDENTIAL builders, *PRO*-1 faced *-2 with a more competitive market, are turning to a traditional consumer marketing technique *PRO*-1 to establish brand - name identity.
"One of the difficulties 0 people in real estate have *T*-1 is that each product is like *PRO* starting a new company, or starting a new line in the fashion business," says *T*-2 L. Robert Lieb president of Mountain Development Corp. in West Paterson, N.J.
So he's using "river" in many project names.
"It'll never be like what Bristol - Myers does *T*-1," he adds *?*, "but it helps *PRO*-2 establish recognition with the public--and with banks."
Weingarten - Siegel Group Inc. of Manalapan, N.J., has built Cross Creek Pointe, Allegro Pointe and other Pointes in New Jersey.
Caspi Development Corp of Armonk, N.Y., has developed two apartment buildings called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Classic and plans a third.
Developer Steve Caspi says 0 the same brand name indicates consistent quality, "regardless of location, design or amenities."
The leader in real estate brand names is developer Ara Hovnanian.
His entry - price condos are labeled *-1 *PRO*-2 Society Hill.
Beacon Hill is for "move - up" town houses, and Nob Hill, for single - family houses.
Because of standardized designs, Mr. Hovnanian says 0 *?*, "a buyer can visualize Society Hill regardless of where it is *T*-2."
Quake Not Likely *PRO*-1 to Jolt The Commercial Market
THE EARTHQUAKE in San Francisco has sent few tremors through the hearts of real estate investors.
"I think 0 there's a disease called *PRO* *PRO*-4 buyer's regret, and I'm sure 0 it's running *PRO*-2 rampant at this moment, but it gets cured *-3 in a short period of time," says *T*-1 Kenneth Leventhal, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Co., a Los Angeles accounting firm specializing in real estate.
"If I were buying a building in San Francisco now the first thing 0 I'd do *T*-1 is insist on a structural inspection, then I'd delay a little, stall a little."
But like other real estate professionals accustomed * to California's quake risks, Mr. Leventhal anticipates little long - term change in the city's commercial real estate market.
Still, local builders are eager *PRO*-1 to tell the world that most of San Francisco doesn't look like the TV images of destruction.
Planners of the Urban Land Institute real estate conference this week hastily added a panel on the quake's effects.
"The message is 0 we build 'em right," says *T*-1 Peter Bedford, a California developer and officer at Urban Land Institute.
"There's seven million square feet of space that *T*-1's doing great.
A volcano *ICH*-1 will erupt next month on the fabled Strip: a 60 - foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes.
The man - made inferno will tower over a man - made lagoon with more than four acres of pools, grottoes and waterfalls.
Visitors, *PRO*-2 whisked * from the Strip on a moving walkway, will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers, which *T*-1 will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried & Roy.
Nearby, six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million - gallon saltwater aquarium.
At the core of all this stands *T*-1 a hotel.
In the lobby behind its nine - story, orchid - strewn atrium, a 20,000 - gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks, stingrays, angelfish, puffers and other creatures of the deep.
And oh, yes.
There's a casino, the financial heart of it all.
This is the Mirage, a $630 million *U* island - fantasy hotel - casino now being completed * for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc.
It's the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort *PRO* to transform itself into a world - famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers.
Las Vegas has seen nothing quite like it before.
Not for 15 years has a big new hotel - casino opened here.
Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s $290 million *U* Excalibur are going up.
The Excalibur, with a castlelike hotel, jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions, will be able *PRO*-1 to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990 *T*-2.
If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park--a $700 million *U* movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000 - room hotel that *T*-1 would become Las Vegas's biggest--the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion *U*.
MGM Grand has agreed *PRO*-1 to buy a 117 - acre site for the resort for $93 million *U* in cash plus stock currently valued * at nearly $30 million *U*.
Smaller projects swell the figure to at least $2.5 billion *U*.
Still other projects that *T*-1 have been announced *-2 but not yet started *-2 could put expenditures above $3 billion *U* over the next few years.
Stephen A. Wynn, who *T*-1 owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says 0 the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors.
"If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of *PRO*-2 being part of it, then they'll come," he says *T*-1.
The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.
By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.
The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs, 95,400 of them in the tourist industry.
Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms.
Hotel - casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage.
After all, 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley.
But Nevada state labor economists think 0 a shortage is probable.
Nobody yet seems *-1 to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels 0 Las Vegas will add *T*-2 to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards *T*-3 here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services.
"Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market *?*," says *T*-1 Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau.
City fathers have managed *PRO*-3 to push through projects that *T*-1 are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport *PRO* to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who *T*-2 fly here.
This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.
The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel - casinos.
Las Vegas promises *RNR*-2, or threatens *RNR*-2, *PRO*-4 to become a giant carnival, with rooms 0 *T*-3 to be had *-1 for $45 *U* a day or less, for visitors uninspired solely by gambling.
Amid a riot of jousting knights, circus clowns, gold - leaf centurions and creatures of the wild, lesser competitors will fall.
Caesars World Inc. plans *PRO*-1 to defend its august reputation by *PRO*-2 sinking $190 million *U* into its opulent Caesars Palace, next door to the new Mirage, and adding a $100 million *U* shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive.
The Palace, with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers, is already well - known for its Caesarean theme.
The Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts, new room towers and casino floor space just *PRO*-1 to keep up.
Where's this huge amount of investment capital coming from *T*-1?
Golden Nugget, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million *U* worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold * to private investors by Drexel, *PRO*-1 to build the Mirage.
Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada.
Will the investments pay off?
The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will *?*.
Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high.
Last year, the tourists left $3 billion *U* *ICH*-1 with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987.
The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.
"If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says *T*-1 Fred Benninger, chairman of MGM Grand.
Ellen Cokely, a tourist from Alton, Ill., seems *-1 inclined *PRO*-2 to agree.
"I'd love it if my daughter had something else 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 here," says *T*-1 Ms. Cokely, watching seven - year - old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip's Wet 'n' Wild water park.
"Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says *T*-1 Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association.
"One generation ago, Mom joined Dad.
Now, in the '90s, we're headed toward a total resort environment."
Only a decade or so ago, casino managers balked at in - room TV sets and other fripperies that *T*-1 distracted from gambling.
Casinos today offer bowling alleys, water parks, golf courses, tennis courts, lush swimming pools and other diversions, and more such facilities are being designed *-1.
Despite the new emphasis on the family trade, however, tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem *-1 certain *PRO*-2 to find it, with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene.
A serious economic downturn, pessimists observe 0 *?*, could hurt the expansionists.
For now, however, the naysayers' voices are drowned *-1 by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip.
This is no place for pedestrians, but at 7:30 on a recent morning, when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane *T*-1, a taxi passenger found it *EXP*-2 faster *PRO* to abandon the cab and walk to her destination.
The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership.
It has happened before.
The Dunes, the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired *-2 by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned * by the last recession, in the early 1980s.
Yet that hasn't discouraged investors.
Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what *T*-1 may turn into another wave of building.
Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward *PRO*-1 building an appropriately spectacular place.
Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors.
Many blue - collar customers of downtown's no - frills gambling spots have been lured *-1 to the Strip or to Laughlin, Nev., a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational - vehicle crowd.
Hotel expansion and an influx of more - discriminating tourists have hurt motels.
Since 1979, the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000.
Many people here expect a room - rate war as the new projects open.
"There's probably going *-3 to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80% - plus occupancy and regular rates," says *T*-2 Paul Rubeli, casino executive at Ramada Inc., which *T*-1 runs the Tropicana.
Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the Mirage will be able *PRO*-1 to squeeze a profit from their cash flow.
The Mirage will cost at least $1 million *U* a day *PRO* to operate.
Mr. Wynn seems *-1 confident that it will produce a healthy profit, but some securities analysts doubt it.
Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp.'s Bally Grand hotel - casino probably will be hardest hit *-1 among major properties.
Bally officials decline *PRO*-1 to discuss the situation.
Bally bought the former MGM Grand hotel - casino from Kirk Kerkorian four years ago.
Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift.
Its parking lot is inconvenient, the MGM lion's - head logo still appears in places, and customers still call it *PRO*-1 the Grand, rather than the Bally Grand.
It has a "great location, but they're going *-1 to have some real problems when everyone around them opens *T*-2," says 0 *T*-3 Daniel Lee, a Drexel analyst.
Older properties that *T*-1 still have a 1950s image are also vulnerable.
Any hotel - casino without a strong identity will get whacked *-2 by the new competition, says 0 *T*-1 Glenn Schaeffer, senior vice president of Circus Circus.
"If you don't know what you are *T*-1, bigger won't make you better," he says *T*-2.
"But it'll sure make you poorer."
Circus Circus's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability *PRO* to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families.
The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates, inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge.
The company's Excalibur will also appeal to families, of course.
Its castle, Mr. Schaeffer says 0 *?*, will be "the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built *."
Some casino owners have resisted the temptation *PRO* to add rooms.
Instead, they are spending *PRO*-2 to reinforce the identity that they believe 0 *T*-1 attracts their customers.
"More rooms aren't the answer for us," says *T*-1 Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck.
While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms.
Some have been combined *-1 into suites for the high rollers.
Caesars has made a specialty of *PRO* catering to high rollers from abroad, who *T*-1 are also being aggressively courted *-2 by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others.
Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches--Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade.
"There's still room for boutique properties," says *T*-1 James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc.
Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel - casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms--all of them suites.
Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about *T*-1.
"The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, *T*-2 are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says *T*-1.
"But 93% of tourists still come for gambling.
We can't lose sight of that.
ALAMCO Inc. said 0 its board has approved a 1 - for - 10 reverse stock split.
The Clarksburg, W.Va., producer of gas and oil, said 0 it wants shareholders to approve the split because it would "enhance the marketability" and trading of the stock.
If *PRO* approved *-1 at a shareholder meeting in December, the number of shares outstanding would decrease to five million from 50 million, and par value would rise to 10 cents from a penny.
The amount of blood 0 surgical patients can donate and store *T*-1 before surgery can be increased *-3 by the new genetically engineered drug, EPO.
EPO, or erythropoietin, is a protein 0 the human body makes *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to stimulate the growth of red blood cells.
A genetically engineered version of the human protein developed * by Amgen Corp. of Thousand Oaks, Calif., recently has been marketed *-1 by the Ortho Pharmaceuticals division of Johnson & Johnson.
A competing version of EPO is being developed *-1 by Genetics Institute Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
The drug is being used *-1 primarily *PRO* to treat anemias.
A new experiment, reported * in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, involved *PRO* giving injections of Amgen's EPO to 23 patients who *T*-1 wanted *PRO*-2 to store units of their own blood.
The patients began *-1 receiving EPO injections about a month before their scheduled surgery.
They then began *-1 donating blood twice a week, *PRO*-2 receiving an EPO injection each time.
If tests indicated a low number of red cells, blood wasn't taken *-1.
The EPO - treated patients donated an average of 5.4 units of blood each compared with only 4.1 units donated * by a similar group of surgical patients who *T*-1 received a placebo injection.
The volume of red cells donated * by the EPO - treated patients was 41% higher per donor, the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported 0 *T*-1.
Brooks Armored Car Service Inc. never wanted *PRO*-1 to get into money laundering.
But July 5, a thunderstorm in Wilmington, Del., caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet, *PRO* pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults.
The water destroyed about $75 million *U* in currency and caked $4 million *U* of coins with mud, *PRO* rendering them *PRO*-1 dangerous to counting machines.
The $75 million *U* in paper money, although *PRO*-1 moldy, mildewy and smelly, was exchanged *-1 through the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia without incident.
But Brooks was unable *PRO*-1 to reach a coin - cleaning agreement with the government.
"We kind of got caught between bureaucracies," says *T*-1 President William F. Brooks Jr.
The U.S. Mint wouldn't take the coin because it wasn't mutilated *-2, and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins, he says 0 *T*-1.
The Philadelphia Fed says 0 it is merely an "agent" for coins, responsible only for storage and distribution.
"We issue paper money; we destroy paper money," says *T*-1 Jane Hinkle, a Philadelphia Fed spokeswoman.
"The coin is their problem."
A Mint official says 0 the agency offered *PRO*-1 to clean the coins for its "bare - bones" cost of $17,000 *U* plus certain other expenses.
But Brooks declined, *PRO*-1 figuring that *PRO* transporting the mucked up money to Washington would cost the company thousands more.
So Brooks gave the dirty work to Coin Wrap Inc., which *T*-1 came up with an unusual solution.
For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 *U* in pennies), Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement - mixing truck.
A giant heater, *PRO*-1 working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers.
After *PRO*-2 clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers *T*-1.
After *PRO*-1 cooling, the coins are then rewrapped *-1.
Brooks expects *PRO*-1 to pay Coin Wrap a total of about $20,000 *U*--a cost that insurance won't cover *T*-2.
And while the job is half done *-1, Brooks is still bitter.
In fact, there's only one person involved * who *T*-1's happy, and that's Floyd String, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement - truck solution.
Not only did his company find $20,000 *U* worth of work, but when the approach was suggested *-1 *T*-3, Mr. String says 0 *?*, Brooks officials "didn't laugh at me or anything.
Sears, Roebuck & Co. signed a contract with Bob Vila, the former host of the popular public television program "This Old House," 0 *T*-1 to star in a half - hour home improvement show sponsored * by the giant retailer.
The *PRO* do - it - yourself show, slated *PRO* to start *-1 airing by June 1990, marks Sears's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products.
In recent months, sales of home improvement items *ICH*-2 have sagged, along with sales of other big ticket durable goods.
The show also signals Mr. Vila's return as a television celebrity.
Earlier this year, public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements.
With Mr. Vila as host, "This Old House" became one of the Public Broadcasting Service's top 10 programs, *PRO*-1 airing weekly on about 300 of the network's stations and seen * by an average of 12 million viewers.
But Home Depot Inc., an Atlanta - based home center chain, objected when Mr. Vila started *-3 doing commercial endorsements for Rickel Home Centers, a New Jersey building supply company that *T*-1 competes with Home Depot in some markets *T*-2.
"I'm ecstatic about the change," said *T*-2 Mr. Vila, whose new syndicated program *PRO*-3 is called *-1 "*PRO*-4 Home Again with Bob Vila."
In an interview, Mr. Vila criticized his old show, which *T*-1 is continuing with a new host.
"Public TV is in fantasy land," he said *T*-1.
"Last season, we did a story that *T*-1 involved *PRO* spending $700,000 *U* in *PRO*-2 converting a two - family house into a bed and breakfast."
In the new show, he said 0 *?*, "we're going *-2 to spend $60,000 *U* *PRO*-3 building a start - up house" for a young couple.
While Sears wouldn't comment on the brouhaha over Mr. Vila's commercial endorsements, it appears *-1 to be building a fence around Mr. Vila's affections.
His contract makes him "exclusive" spokesman for Sears's home improvement marketing campaigns.
Ogilvy & Mather in Chicago, a unit of WPP Group PLC, will handle the advertising account and syndication.
The only other endorsement permitted * by the contract involves a series of Time - Life home improvement and repair books.
His other agreements *PRO* to promote products have expired.
Little matter for Mr. Vila, who *T*-1 complains that "public TV never paid me more than $40,000 *U* a year."
He said 0 his compensation under the Sears contract is "a multimillion dollar deal.
Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of *PRO* telling authors how they should write history and biography *T*-1.
These decisions deserve more attention than they have received *?* from scholars, and from journalists as well.
Russell Miller's "Bare - Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.
Mr. Hubbard, who *T*-1 died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which *T*-2 licensed them to New Era Publications, a Danish corporation.
In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction *PRO* to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from *PRO*-1 publishing "Bare - Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights.
The publisher argued in response that the "fair use" statute permits quotation "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching,...scholarship, or research."
District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed *-1 to make its claim within a reasonable time--the doctrine 0 lawyers call *T*-2 "*PRO*-3 laches."
As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism."
Verbatim quotation, the judge believed 0 *?*, was justified *-1 in order *PRO* to prove points 0 the author had asserted *T*-4 about Mr. Hubbard--mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that *T*-2 could not be persuasively demonstrated *-3 without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words.
"The biographer / critic," Judge Leval wrote *?*, "should not be required simply *-2 *PRO*-4 to express...conclusions without *PRO* defending them by example.
" In such circumstances, free - speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner.
But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters.
He distinguished the two cases: In Salinger, Judge Leval noted 0 *?*, the quotations were for the purpose of *PRO* enlivening the biography rather than of *PRO* proving points about the subject.
Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials.
Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary *PRO* to prove historical points, failed the fair - use test and therefore infringed copyright.
But the proper remedy, Judge Leval said 0 *?*, lay in a suit for damages, not in an injunction.
The case went on appeal to the Second Circuit.
In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, *PRO*-1 joined *-2 by Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on *PRO* denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare - Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright.
"We conclude," the two judges wrote *?*, "that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction."
Had the suit been filed *-2 in time, they said 0 *?*, "Bare - Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed *-3.
This was too much for James Oakes, the court's chief judge.
In a powerful separate opinion, Judge Oakes further distinguished the Salinger case by *PRO*-2 pointing out that a living person, like Mr. Salinger, had privacy rights that *T*-1 did not apply to a dead man, like Mr. Hubbard.
"I thought that Salinger might by *PRO*-2 being taken *-1 in another factual context come back *PRO*-2 to haunt us.
This case realizes that concern."
Decisions by the Second Circuit itself, Judge Oakes continued 0 *?*, had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the indispensability in particular cases of verbatim quotations are vital components of fair use.
And the injunction 0 Judges Miner and Altimari would so readily have granted *T*-1 had New Era sued in time?
Suppression of the book, Judge Oakes observed 0 *?*, would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the First Amendment.
Moreover, and here Judge Oakes went to the heart of the question, "Responsible biographers and historians constantly use primary sources, letters, diaries, and memoranda.
Indeed, it *EXP*-1 would be irresponsible *PRO* to ignore such sources of information."
Now, scholars in *PRO*-2 fulfilling their responsibility do not claim the right *PRO* to invade every collection of papers that *T*-1 bears upon their topics of investigation.
And of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers, whether in their own possession or as *PRO* donated or sold *-1 to libraries.
But in the "Bare - Faced Messiah" case the author found most of his material in court records or via the Freedom of Information Act.
And when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials *T*-2, copyright should not be permitted *-3 *PRO*-5 to deny them use of quotations that *T*-1 help *PRO*-4 to establish historical points.
Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship.
Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear *-1 to have a clue.
Yet at the moment they are the judges who *T*-1 are making the law.
As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, *PRO*-1 torn *-2 from context and broadly construed *-2, is controlling.
If an author quotes "more than minimal amounts" of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, "he deserves *PRO*-2 to be enjoined *-1."
The courts have not defined "minimal amounts," but publishers, I understand 0 *?*, take it to mean about 50 words.
The "Bare - Faced Messiah" decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise.
A second decision, handed * down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship.
Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published * in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives."
The articles were largely based *-3 on interviews 0 Ms. Malcolm had taped *T*-2 with Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who *T*-1 had served as projects director of the Freud Archives.
Mr. Masson then brought a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm, the New Yorker and Knopf.
As a public figure, Mr. Masson had *-1 to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed * to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated *-2.
The quotes could not be found *-1 on the tapes, and the two judges who *T*-2 decided the case for Ms. Malcolm and her publishers conceded that, for the purpose of their decision, "we assume 0 the quotations were deliberately altered *-3."
For all historians and most journalists, this admission would have been sufficient *PRO* to condemn the Malcolm articles.
But Judge Arthur Alarcon, joined * by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, took the astonishing position that it *EXP*-1 is perfectly OK *PRO* to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks.
In his eloquent dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski observed that when a writer uses quotation marks in *PRO*-3 reporting what someone has said *T*-1 *T*-2, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged * of "uh" and "you know" and grammatical error.
While judges have an obligation *ICH*-1 under the First Amendment *PRO* to safeguard freedom of the press, "the right *PRO* to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press."
Ms. Malcolm, for example, wrote that Mr. Masson described himself as "the greatest analyst who *T*-1 ever lived."
No such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority cited Mr. Masson's remark "It's me alone...against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the Malcolm fabrication.
But, as Judge Kozinski noted, the context shows that Mr. Masson's "me alone" remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared *-1 by anyone else.
Ms. Malcolm had Mr. Masson describing himself as "an intellectual gigolo."
Again, no such statement appears on the tapes.
The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory.
Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained * and writes that "for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is...a devastating admission of professional dishonesty."
These were only two of a series of fabrications that *T*-1 had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of *PRO* making Mr. Masson "appear *-2 more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self - aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears *-3 *?* from his own statements."
As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist...and, in the end, a self - destructive fool.
But it is not Janet Malcolm who *T*-1 calls him *PRO*-2 such: his own words reveal this psychological profile."
We now know that the words were not always his own.
"There is one sacred rule of journalism," John Hersey has said *T*-1.
"The writer must not invent."
Should the green light 0 Judges Alarcon and Hall have given *T*-1 to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians--and for citizens.
As Judge Kozinski put it: "*PRO* To invoke the right *PRO* to deliberately distort what someone else has said *T*-1 is *PRO* to assert the right *PRO* to lie in print....
Masson has lost his case, but the defendants, and the profession to which they belong *T*-1, have lost far more."
The historical profession will survive these decisions.
Perhaps in time the Supreme Court will correct them.
But *PRO* writing history is tough enough without judges gratuitously throwing obstacles in the scholar's path.
Mr. Schlesinger is Albert Schweitzer professor of the humanities at the City University of New York and a winner of Pulitzer Prizes in history and biography.
An investment company said 0 it offered *PRO*-1 to acquire Arby's Inc., the fast - food operator, for $205 million *U*.
The proposal, however, was immediately rebuffed *-1 by Arby's parent, DWG Corp.
"Arby's isn't for sale," said *T*-1 Renee Mottram, senior vice president at DWG.
The new suitor, Stevric Equity Ventures Inc., of Mineola, N.Y., characterized its proposal as the "first truly independent offer which *T*-1 does not pit one interest group against another within the Arby's franchisee community."
In September, DWG, a Miami Beach, Fla., holding company controlled * by financeer Victor Posner, rejected an offer *ICH*-1 from a group of Arby's franchisees *PRO* to acquire Arby's for $200 million *U*.
Since then, a second group of franchisees has banded together *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to wrestle control of the unit from Mr. Posner.
Arby's is the marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100 restaurants in the chain.
Stevric's principals, Richard and Steven Buckley, said 0 they led the acquisition group that *T*-1 acquired the Nathan's Famous Inc. restaurant chain and subsequently served as the top officers of the company.
Richard Buckley said 0 Stevric's acquisition of Arby's "would allow seasoned franchisers and food - service operators, with no conflicts of interest, to stabilize franchisee relations and properly refocus the company's energies toward growth.
Adolph Coors Co. said 0 its Coors Brewing Co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year.
The move, which *T*-2 was expected *-1, marks the first time since Prohibition that Coors has sold a non-alcoholic beverage *T*-4, and marks the company's entry into a crowded, but fast - growing market that *T*-3 generated about $2.2 billion *U* in sales last year.
Coors is hoping *PRO*-1 to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide.
Perrier, sold * by Perrier Group of America, a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of Paris, and Evian, sold * by a U.S. unit BSN of France, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities.
Coors, with its large beer - distribution network, could penetrate more markets.
The company said 0 the water will be called *PRO* *PRO*-1 Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used * in Coors beer.
The company said 0 it will sell the water *PRO*-1 plain and with lemon - lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28 - ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six - packs.
The test markets, though *PRO*-1 not specified *-2, will be in northern California, Arizona and Colorado, some of the hottest bottled - water markets.
PRIMERICA Corp., New York, raised its quarterly 14% to eight cents a share *ICH*-1, from seven cents, payable Nov. 24 to stock of record Nov. 6.
The financial services company, which *T*-1 has about 98.8 million shares outstanding, noted its "continued confidence in the ongoing strength of the operations.
Troubled SCI Television Inc. proposed *PRO*-1 to restructure much of its $1.3 billion *U* in debt *PRO* to buy time 0 *PRO* to sell assets and pay its obligations *T*-2.
The leveraged buy - out firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which *T*-1 owns 46% of the common equity of SCI TV, indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to 15%, *PRO* giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring.
KKR also signaled to the company's creditors that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed *-1 and forgo their voting rights.
Holders of SCI TV's $507 million *U* of high - yield junk bonds are being asked *PRO*-1 to forgive a lot of debt in exchange for *PRO* taking a 39% equity stake in SCI TV.
They immediately termed the proposal *PRO*-1 inadequate and said 0 the restructuring would not solve the company's problems.
"I think 0 the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders' eyes that substantial revisions will be required *-1 *PRO* to get it done," says *T*-2 analyst Craig Davis of R.D. Smith & Co. here.
Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire *ICH*-1 by the firm *PRO* to wash its hands of SCI TV.
But a spokesman for KKR says that with only a 15% equity stake, it *EXP*-1 wouldn't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation.
KKR already has made about $1 billion *U* of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles.
SCI TV, which *T*-2 is controlled *-1 by Nashville, Tenn., entrepreneur George Gillett, owns six TV stations, including several CBS Inc. affiliates.
It is having trouble *PRO* meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in 1987 for a leveraged buy - out.
Through investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., SCI TV is offering *PRO*-1 to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value *T*-2 at ranges from 20 cents to 70 cents on the dollar.
KKR would give up a 31% equity stake to bondholders, while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8% stake.
While one big SCI TV investor thinks 0 that's pretty generous, many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV.
Those investors think 0 SCI TV needs new equity *PRO*-1 to survive.
SCI TV's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $153 million *U* of bank debt.
It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that *T*-1 have fallen *PRO*-2 due; the grace period for *PRO* paying the bill expires Nov. 16.
At the same time, investors estimate 0 the restructuring would cut the company's annual cash interest bill from about $90 million *U* to $85 million *U*.
Yet *PRO* to pay that interest bill, analysts say 0 SCI TV will only produce about $80 million to $90 million *U* of cash flow a year *T*-1.
In a corner of the cavernous, new Nippon Convention Center sits *T*-1 Mazda Motor Corp.'s advanced - technology display.
The highlight: a "fragrance control system."
With the touch of a button, drivers can choose from lavender, jasmine, mint or perfume scents, all blown *-1 in through the car's air - conditioning system.
The soft, wafting aromas will "improve ride comfort," the display attests 0 *T*-1, and a proud employee says 0 Mazda hopes *PRO*-2 to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two.
*PRO* Welcome to the 28th Tokyo Motor Show.
Here you can find Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying a "live fish transporter," a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels, and Nissan Motor Co. with its "keyless" Boga, whose doors *T*-1 unlock upon *PRO*-2 recognizing the owner's fingerprints.
Suzuki Motor Co.'s Escudome sport vehicle features a pop - out rear tent and invites drivers *PRO*-1 to go "back to the nature."
But this biennial event, the world's largest display of cars and trucks, has its serious side, including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle - suspension systems.
It's also the prime showcase for a country whose world dominance in the industry *T*-1 is increasingly acknowledged *-3, and therein lies *T*-2 the draw.
Even the biggest auto shows in the U.S. are largely regional affairs, but the Tokyo show is international.
Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up.
Detroit - to - Tokyo flights were booked *-1 solid this week as Motor City executives, including Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald E. Petersen and Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, flocked *PRO*-2 to see the future.
Even the Soviet Union came, for the first time in 24 years, *PRO*-1 to show off its Lada Niva sedan and its futuristic dark - blue "Kompakt" model.
Here's *T*-3 a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported *T*-1, and what the foreign visitors saw *T*-2.
New Technology
The hottest displays were items that *T*-1 insulate passengers from bumps, potholes and other rigors of the road.
These "active suspension systems" electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car's ride.
Existing suspension systems try *PRO*-1 to absorb bounces, but active suspension provides power *PRO* to counter the jolts.
Nissan, in a 34 - page tract, modestly compares its "hydraulic active suspension" to a cheetah, and equates the various parts to the animal's heart, brain, nerves and blood vessels.
Toyota Motor Corp. grandly touted its system in a car that *T*-1 splits in half *PRO* to reveal the suspension's inner workings.
Nissan says 0 it will introduce its first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan, and Toyota's Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring.
But drivers in the U.S. must wait: The Japanese, for now, are keeping active suspension for domestic use only.
And Detroit's Big Three auto makers say 0 their systems are still under development.
In the engine department, several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade *T*-1 could provide power equal to today's engines and yet take up only half the space, *PRO* allowing for shorter hoods.
In the so - called two - stroke engines, which *T*-1 are expected *-2 to get sharply higher gas mileage, each piston goes up and down only once *PRO* to provide power.
By contrast, the pistons in conventional four - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle.
The two - stroke engine displays by Toyota and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives, who *T*-1 are rushing *PRO*-2 to develop two - stroke engines.
Honda Motor Co. shows a more conventional five - cylinder engine in the new Accord Inspire model, which *T*-1 made its debut just this month--in Japan only.
Honda says 0 the five - cylinder engine provides a compromise between the fuel - economy of a four - cylinder, and the power of a V - 6.
It is rumored *-2 to be bound *-1 for a new model in the luxury Acura line in the U.S., but Honda officials wouldn't comment.
Odd Cars, Funny Names
There's plenty of whimsy here, but it *EXP*-1 isn't always clear whether it's intentional.
The show's symbol is a woman riding on a snail, not your usual metaphor for speed and agility.
But the sponsors have an explanation: "Through the character associated * with a snail," they say *?*, "important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought *-2."
Japanese auto makers are known *-1 for *PRO*-3 coming up with funny names, but this year the practice seems *-2 to have reached a new high--or low.
Honda has a tiny motorcycle called * *PRO*-1 the Monkey, and a slightly larger cousin, the Gorilla.
Mitsubishi has a futuristic delivery truck called * *PRO*-1 the Guppy.
Mazda has the Bongo truck and, under its Autozam nameplate, a "microvan" called * *PRO*-2 the Scrum.
Its buglike Carol minicar is "designed *-1 with softness, gentleness and warmheartedness."
But the court jester appears *-1 to be Japan's smallest car maker, Daihatsu Motor Co.
One of its futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker, which *T*-1 seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear.
Daihatsu also has the Fellow 90, the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo.
The jokes aren't just on the Japanese, though.
Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, the French auto maker, has a concept car called * *PRO*-1 the Megane.
The name is supposed *-1 to connote feminine grandeur, but in Japanese it means "eyeglasses."
Foreign Presence
Foreign auto makers are taking the Tokyo Motor Show more seriously than ever.
AB Volvo invites passers - by *PRO*-3 to play "the role of the test dummy" by *PRO*-4 hopping in a car that *T*-1 simulates a crash *PRO*-5 to show just how its seat - belt tightener works *T*-2.
Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea has its first - ever exhibit in Tokyo.
General Motors Corp. is sponsoring its first independent display in 10 years, and it includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood - grain side panels.
Ford and Chrysler also have exhibits, although theirs are tucked *-1 in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section.
"We've got *-1 to get out of the Detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality," declares *T*-2 *ICH*-4 Charles M. Jordan, GM's vice president for design, in *PRO*-3 explaining his pilgrimage to the Tokyo Show.
Even so, traditional American cockiness isn't terribly endangered *-1.
Ford officials, for example, crowed about their first - ever Tokyo Grand Prix racing victory.
True, Ford was declared *-1 the winner Sunday, but only after the Honda driver who *T*-3 crossed the finish line first was disqualified *-2 because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds.
Mr. Jordan of GM, meanwhile, still criticizes Japanese styling.
"It *EXP*-1's hard for the Japanese," he says *?*, "*PRO* to get a feeling in a car, to get a passion in a car, to get emotion in a car.
International Business Machines Corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract *PRO* to manage all of Eastman Kodak Co.'s data - processing needs *T*-1.
But the computer giant appears *-1 to have lost a second key contract with Kodak to archrival Digital Equipment Corp.
Kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with Maynard, Mass. - based Digital *PRO*-1 to manage all of its voice and data communications needs.
Kodak, based * in Rochester, N.Y., said 0 IBM also had bid for the business.
IBM is based *-1 in Armonk, N.Y.
The loss is a setback to IBM, which *T*-1 pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration.
That's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations *T*-1.
A Kodak spokesman declined *PRO*-2 to disclose the potential value of the contract, which *T*-1 is still in negotiation.
He said that American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI Communications Corp., Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital's subcontractors on the project.
"When we decided *PRO*-3 to look outside the company for critical data - processing and communications services *T*-2, we wanted *PRO*-4 to get the best vendor for that service," said *T*-1 Paul Allen, the spokesman.
"That's why we went with IBM for data center management...and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications *T*-1.
*PRO* Regarding your Sept. 28 Politics & Policy column on the party differences over *PRO* cutting capital gains or expanding IRAs: Why not compromise now and save the public from the coming infantile congressional political rhetoric that *T*-1 seems *-2 to go hand in hand with the process?
The Republicans maintain that a 30% capital - gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment, while the Democrats maintain that an increase in the top income - tax rate and expanded IRAs will raise revenue and spur savings.
This is a classic example of the old saying, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
It *EXP*-2's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $50,000 *U* to pay the same 28% incremental tax rate as a family with taxable income of $250,000 *U*.
The 33% bracket should apply to all income over the applicable level, not just the 5% rate adjustment amount.
It *EXP*-2's equally ridiculous *PRO* not to provide a capital investment or retirement - savings tax incentive.
Jeffrey T. Schmidlin
PWA Corp. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to sell by spring 1992 all 15 passenger planes 0 it acquired *T*-2 earlier this year in its 248 million Canadian dollar (US$211.6 million *U*) purchase of Wardair Inc.
PWA, which *T*-1 recently merged Wardair's operations with those of PWA - owned Canadian Airlines International Ltd., Canada's second - biggest airline, said 0 the proposed sale is part of a revised five - year plan aimed * at *PRO* streamlining its fleet and shedding debt.
PWA wouldn't estimate the value of Wardair's aircraft, which *T*-1 include 12 Airbus A310 - 300s and three Boeing 747 - 100s.
But James Ireland, a Miami - based technical analyst with Avmark Inc., an aircraft evaluation firm, estimated the total "half - life" value of the 15 planes at about $650 million or more *U*.
Mr. Ireland said 0 11 DC10 - 30 aircraft that PWA also said 0 it plans *PRO*-2 to sell *T*-1, *PRO* beginning in 1992, have a current half - life value of about $34 million *U* each, or a total $374 million *U*, *PRO* raising aggregate potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $1.02 billion *U*.
Mr. Ireland said 0 current demand for used aircraft is strong, partly because surging orders for new aircraft have lengthened waiting lists.
He predicted that PWA would have little difficulty *PRO*-1 attracting prospective buyers.
Under its revised fleet plan, PWA said 0 it will also increase its existing fleet of eight Boeing 767 - 300ER aircraft to 18 by 1994, and add four more Boeing 747 - 400s by 1994 to the two units that it previously planned *PRO*-2 to add *T*-1 by next year.
PWA said 0 two of the Boeing 767 - 300ER aircraft scheduled * for delivery in 1990 would be leased *-1 out for two to five years.
PWA didn't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul, but a Toronto - based analyst estimated it at about $450 million *U* (US), excluding replacement costs for the 11 DC10 - 30 aircraft that PWA plans *PRO*-2 to sell *T*-1, and purchase costs for as many as 17 Airbus 320 - 200 aircraft that PWA previously ordered *T*-3.
"I don't see this as a debt reduction exercise.
It's focused *-2 on *PRO* streamlining" PWA's fleet in a bid *PRO* to cut training and aircraft servicing costs, the analyst said 0 *T*-1.
PWA's long - term debt and capital lease obligations rose to C$1.24 billion *U* at the end of the second quarter, nearly double the year - earlier figure, *PRO* reflecting debt absorbed * under the Wardair purchase.
PWA said 0 it also expects *PRO*-1 to announce by Tuesday whether it will take delivery of all 17 Airbus 320 - 200 aircraft 0 it previously ordered *T*-2.
The first five leased units were *-2 to be delivered *-1 in 1991.
Some of America's biggest trading partners gave a quick thumbs - down to a U.S. proposal *PRO* to liberalize world trade and reduce farm - product subsidies.
In Geneva, where world trade talks are being held *-1 under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT *T*-2, the European Community called the U.S. proposal "*PRO*-3 a step backward."
And Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries told a committee of Japan's parliament that Washington's proposal was impractical and that Tokyo would continue *-1 to heavily subsidize its rice farmers.
The U.S., in a far - reaching plan submitted * to the Geneva meeting Tuesday, proposed *PRO* curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years.
U.S. officials said 0 the plan was flexible, and was intended *-1 as a pragmatic approach for *PRO* gradually removing trade - distorting subsidies.
But the EC reacted defiantly, *PRO*-1 arguing that the proposal's main aim is *PRO* to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy, the EC's $28 billion *U* - a - year price support program.
"The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation," the EC said *T*-1 in a statement.
EC officials say 0 they are irked *-1 that the U.S. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the "elimination" of export subsides, not just reduction.
EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry said 0 the U.S. plan "calls into question" the agreement reached * by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking "substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection."
U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord.
He said 0 he was surprised *-1 by the EC's reaction, *PRO*-2 calling it "*PRO*-3 vehement, even frenetic."
The U.S. proposal also was criticized *-1 by food - importing developing countries, who *T*-2 said that the U.S. made no special allowances for poor nations.
While many experts argue that food - importing nations would eventually become self - sufficient in a free - market system, the poorest nations are likely *-1 to need help in the meantime.
Ambassador Katz said 0 the U.S. was open to *PRO* discussing particular problems of developing countries.
The U.S. administration said 0 its plan would allow considerable flexibility in *PRO* determining how and when the free - trade goals would be achieved *-1 *T*-2.
The U.S. argues that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by *PRO*-3 converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that *T*-1, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased *-2 out over 10 years.
But the EC is strongly opposed to *PRO* converting agricultural supports into tariffs.
The new U.S. package also says 0 countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
It would establish procedures 0 *T*-1 to prevent countries from *PRO*-2 using health and sanitation rules *PRO*-3 to impede trade arbitrarily.
*PRO* Seeking *PRO*-3 to allay European concerns, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said in Washington that the new U.S. plan wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would encourage them *PRO*-4 to "grow what the markets desire *T*-1 instead of what the government wants *T*-2."
The EC, with a population of 320 million, has 8.5 million farmers, while the U.S., with a population of about 245 million, has only two million farmers.
Japan's objections to the U.S. plan center around its desire *PRO* to stay self - sufficient in rice, a staple food, even though foreign producers are far more efficient.
HEALTH CLUBS gear up for a graying clientele.
Although their ads picture curvy young people in skimpy outfits, club owners know 0 the future lies with the lumpier over - 40 set.
"It *EXP*-1's a misconception that physical fitness is something for the young and middle - aged," says *T*-2 Michael Pacholik, sales manager of the LA Fitness club, Diamond Bar, Calif.
About 10% to 15% *U* of members at Atlanta's Holiday Espre Center are elderly, says 0 *T*-1 Gerald Williams, fitness consultant.
"Most want cardiovascular conditioning...the No. 1 way of *PRO* reducing risk of heart disease."
The Association of Quality Clubs, which *T*-41 puts 1988 industry revenue at $5 billion *U*, surveyed the health - conscious over - 40 market and found that 43% exercise regularly.
Michael Hays, head of ProBody Fitness, notes 0 an industry "wash" is in progress.
"Clubs need *-1 to be run *-4 like restaurants where every square foot makes a dollar *T*-2," he says *T*-3.
Older people help profits by *PRO*-1 filling in "downtime."
He adds: "The medical market and the fitness market parallel each other and are going *-1 to cross real soon."
People on fixed incomes get a break at Espre; over 55 wins a 45% discount at Anaheim Imperial Health Spa.
"HOT" TOPAZ sparks regulator, jeweler concern over import of irradiated stones.
A committee of gem dealers investigates the source of some "hot" blue topaz stones recently reported * by a Hong Kong jewelry manufacturer.
In the U.S., radiation limits are set and monitored *-41 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which *T*-42 licenses reactors that *T*-43 process the topaz.
The agency is working on *PRO*-1 licensing importers but doesn't currently monitor imports.
Topaz, a translucent mineral that *T*-2 is often whitish when *PRO*-6 taken *-7 from the ground *T*-5, can be turned *-1 *PRO*-8 blue by irradiation, which *T*-3 transforms it into a gemstone that *T*-4 looks like an aquamarine.
"The {stones} that *T*-2 were irradiated *-1 in the U.S. are safe," says *T*-3 John Hickey, chief of the NRC operations branch, Washington.
"We believe that the vast majority of imported material is safe.
But there is a small risk that some *ICH*-2 were imported *-1 with high radiation levels."
Mr. Hickey added that the stones found * in Hong Kong are thought *-1 to carry double the U.S. radiation limit, although he noted that double or even triple the U.S. limit is "still in the range of safe levels."
Some jewelers have Geiger counters 0 *T*-1 to measure topaz radiation.
CAPITAL TRAVELS to Europe as 1992 unification nears.
Boston's Advent International raises $230 million *U* *ICH*-2 from U.S. pension funds and other institutions 0 *PRO* to invest *T*-1 in Europe.

RADIO MALAISE draws the ear of the Federal Communications Commission.
AM radio, which *T*-1 has been losing listeners to FM channels since the 1970s, approaches the 1990s with a diminished voice.
But it may have a good listener in Washington.
The FCC plans *PRO*-2 to hear a day of testimony *ICH*-1 Nov. 16 on the plight of AM radio.
The commission believes that *PRO* improving AM service would broaden listening selections and increase options for advertisers.
The issues are also thought *-1 to be important to the FCC's new chairman, Alfred Sikes, a former AM broadcaster in his native Missouri.
The FM radio band, *PRO*-1 considered *PRO*-2 technically superior because it can carry stereo broadcasts, has cornered the airwaves for *PRO* delivering music.
AM stereo remains largely undeveloped because it lacks a uniform delivery system.
The National Association of Broadcasters in June adopted an agenda for *PRO* revitalizing AM radio that *T*-1 includes, among other things, *PRO* pursuing further FCC action on *PRO* selecting an AM stereo standard and seeking a law requiring all stereo receivers *PRO*-2 to include AM stereo.
Listeners turned to radios run * on batteries for news when the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo cut power lines *T*-1.

Senate Democrats who *T*-1 favor *PRO*-3 cutting the capital - gains tax aren't ready *PRO*-2 to line up behind the leading Senate proposal.
Their reluctance *PRO* to support the proposal is another blow to the capital - gains cut, which *T*-1 has had a roller - coaster existence since the beginning of the year, when it was considered *-2 dead *T*-3 and then suddenly revived *-2 and was passed *-2 by the House.
Nevertheless, Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member on the tax - writing Senate Finance Committee, last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) was confident 0 he had enough votes *PRO* to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today.
Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat, *PRO*-1 telling Mr. Mitchell: "I sense at this stage 0 you may have the votes."
The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion, *PRO*-1 violating usual Senate decorum.
Their tone was good - natured, with Mr. Packwood saying 0 he intended *PRO*-1 to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and Sen. Mitchell saying 0 he intended *PRO*-2 to use procedural means *PRO* to block it again and again.
Although the proposal, authored * by Mr. Packwood and Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), appears *-1 to have general backing by Republicans, their votes aren't sufficient *PRO* to pass it.
And Democrats, who *T*-1 are under increasing pressure *ICH*-2 from their leaders *PRO* to reject the gains - tax cut, are finding reasons *PRO* to say no, at least for now.
A major reason is that they believe 0 the Packwood - Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run.
The Packwood - Roth proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held *-1 *T*-2.
It also would create a new individual retirement account that *T*-1 would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made * for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first - home purchases and tuition.
"A number of us are not going *-2 to touch capital gains, IRAs or anything else unless it contributes to deficit - reduction," said *T*-3 Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.), who *T*-1 is one of the 10 to 20 Democrats who the Bush administration believes 0 *T*-4 might favor *PRO*-5 giving preferential treatment to capital gains.
President Bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House.
And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators, there was outspoken opposition to *PRO* cutting the capital - gains tax this year, according to participants.
The trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success.
"There is a one - out - of - three shot of *PRO* getting it this year," said *T*-1 Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, a leading Democratic proponent of *PRO* cutting the capital - gains tax.
He called the battle *PRO*-1 "uphill."
Other Democrats who *T*-1 favor a capital - gains cut are even more pessimistic.
"There will be no capital - gains bill this year," said *T*-1 Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark .).
"I'm probably not going *-1 to vote for any capital - gains proposal.
The IRA portion (of the Packwood - Roth plan) is irresponsible."
Another significant factor in the capitalgains debate is the extent to which it has become a purely political battle between President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Mitchell *T*-1.
Mr. Mitchell has made clear to his wavering colleagues that the issue is important to him personally.
Today, Sen. Mitchell and other leading Democrats plan *PRO*-1 to turn up the heat again by *PRO*-2 holding a news conference *PRO*-3 to bash the proposal.
Estimates requested * by Sen. Mitchell from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital - gains differential of $13 million *U* each in 1985, the last year for which figures are available *T*-1.
White House officials acknowledged yesterday that Democrats still are reluctant *PRO*-1 to publicly express support for the Packwood - Roth capital gains proposal because they are loath *PRO*-2 to buck Sen. Mitchell.
As a result, the officials said 0 they are open to *PRO* making a variety of deals with Senate Democrats *PRO* to win their support for a capital - gains tax cut.
Democrats asked in * this week for discussions with President Bush have suggested ways of *PRO* "tinkering" with the Packwood - Roth proposal, *PRO*-3 suggesting an interest in *PRO* looking for a modified version 0 they can back *T*-1, one official said 0 *T*-2.
In addition, White House aides think that there are numerous other important measures 0 Democrats badly wanted *T*-2 passed *-3--such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health - care plan for the elderly--that *T*-1 might provide the president leverage in *PRO* cutting deals with Democrats.
A capital - gains tax cut might be paired *-1 with such measures *PRO* to help *PRO* ensure passage.
Other possibilities include a child - care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage.
If they can't secure immediate passage of a capital - gains plan, administration officials also aren't ruling out *PRO*-1 making a deal with Congress *PRO* to put off a vote until a firm date in the future, even next year.
But the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have *-1 to apply to both the House and the Senate.

Representatives of the Inuit and Cree peoples living in Quebec and Labrador in northeastern Canada told the ministry of the planned action at a meeting, a ministry spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
They also wanted *PRO*-1 to prevent a NATO training base being built * in the region, he said 0 *T*-2.
The action, in the Canadian Federal Court, will be against Canada, the Netherlands, West Germany, Britain and the U.S., the ministry spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Japan suspended imports of French mushrooms after *PRO*-2 finding some contaminated by radiation, an official of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said 0 *T*-1.
Japan has been testing imported food from Europe since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union, the spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Since then, the ministry has announced 50 bans on food imports from European countries, including Italy, Spain, Turkey, Greece and the Soviet Union.
The Venice city council is battling plans *PRO* to tap huge gas fields off the coast that it says 0 *T*-1 will speed up the city's slow sinking into its lagoon.
AGIP, the state - owned energy giant, made the announcement about the gas field last month.
*PRO*-1 Located *-2 six miles northeast of Venice, the field contains 875 billion cubic feet of methane gas - one - tenth of Italy's reserves.
Alarmed councilors say 0 the project could jeopardize costly efforts *PRO* to stop *RNR*-2, or slow down *RNR*-2, the subsidence that *T*-1 makes Venice subject to regular and destructive flooding.
The council unanimously opposed the idea of AGIP pumping out the methane gas and swiftly appealed to the company and to Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who *T*-1 has yet *-2 to reply.
AGIP refused *PRO*-1 to reconsider and says 0 drilling is due *-2 to start early next year.
"It's unlikely 0 *PRO* extracting the gas will cause subsidence," says *T*-1 a spokeswoman.
Thieves stole a 12th century fresco from an abandoned church in Camerino, Italy, by *PRO*-3 removing the entire wall on which the work had been painted *-1 *T*-4, police said 0 *T*-2....
West Germany's BMW commissioned the Nuremberg post office *PRO*-1 to test a prototype battery - powered car.
The vehicle has a top speed of 65 miles an hour and requires *PRO* recharging *?* from a standard wall socket every 100 miles.
Wilson H. Taylor, president and chief executive officer of this insurance and financial services concern, was elected *-1 to the additional post of chairman.
Mr. Taylor, 45 years old, succeeds Robert D. Kilpatrick, 64, who *T*-1 is retiring, as *PRO* reported earlier.
Mr. Kilpatrick will remain a director.
Canadian manufacturers recorded a 0.8% decline in August in their backlog of unfilled orders, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said 0 *T*-1.
The August drop was the fourth decline in five months.
Most of the August decrease was attributed *-1 to lower order backlogs in the primary metal and electric and electronics - product industries.
Manufacturers' shipments rose 0.3% in August following two months of declines.
Inventories fell 0.3% in August.
I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell's exchange with a Gosbank representative ("*PRO* Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails," editorial page, Oct. 5) with great interest, since the gold standard is one of my areas of research.
Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union's large gold reserves would give it "great power *PRO* to establish credibility *T*-1."
During the latter part of the 19th century, Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100% of its outstanding currency, but no one outside Russia used rubles.
The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that *T*-2 averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted *-1 throughout the world.
The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common - law rights *ICH*-1 of creditors *PRO* to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain.
By contrast, in 19th - century Russia an authoritarian government owned the bank and had the power *PRO* to revoke payment whenever it chose *T*-1, much as it would *?* in today's Soviet Union.
The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law, rather than the choice of gold for *PRO* valuing the currency.
It *EXP*-1 is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914, when the Bank of England was an independent private bank *T*-3, the pound was never devalued *-4 and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended *-5, but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England, the pound was devalued *-2 with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined.
The Soviet Union should keep these lessons in mind as it seeks *PRO*-1 to establish the ruble as an international currency.
One way 0 *PRO* to make the ruble into a major international currency *T*-1 would be *PRO*-2 to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based * on Swiss laws.
Unless the laws determining the noteholder's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes, however, a gold - based ruble would be as unsuccessful *ICH*-1 for the Soviets as it was *?* for the czars.

Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil company, said 0 its West German subsidiary Castrol has a 49% share in Explonaft G.m.b.H., a new Polish lubricants company.
The remaining 51% of the joint venture will be controlled *-1 by Polish lubricants manufacturers, refiners and technical institutes.
Explonaft will develop application guidelines for lubricants, sell high - quality mineral oils, and offer services in industrial cleaning and related fields.
Burmah, which *T*-1 has a strong market position supplying marine lubricants and metal - working fluids in Poland, described the joint venture as "fairly small."
It didn't provide details of setup costs.
Ohbayashi Corp. agreed *PRO*-1 to buy E.W. Howell Co., the U.S. subsidiary of Selmer - Sande AS, of Norway, for about $7 million *U*.
Howell, a Port Washington, N.Y., construction concern, was established *-1 in 1891.
It has three U.S. branches.
Ohbayashi officials said 0 the purchase was undertaken *-2 *PRO* to participate in ventures in and around New York City.
They said 0 Howell is particularly successful there because of its membership cooperation with local unions.
Ohbayashi is Japan's second largest construction company.
Until now, its inability *PRO* to form membership ties with organized labor has kept it from *PRO*-1 penetrating the lucrative New York metropolitan area construction market.
The company also hopes 0 the latest acquisition will help *PRO*-1 secure large construction orders from Japanese concerns with U.S. operations.
Ohbayashi cited industry publications crediting Howell, currently capitalized * at $2.2 million *U*, with *PRO*-1 receiving orders valued * at $225 million *U* in 1988.
The Japanese company received orders totaling 12.44 billion yen ($87.9 million *U*) from its U.S. business activities during the fiscal year ended in March.
Hale Milgrim, 41 years old, senior vice president, marketing at Elecktra Entertainment Inc., was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president of Capitol Records Inc., a unit of this entertainment concern.
Mr. Milgrim succeeds David Berman, who *T*-1 resigned last month.
One day after Delmed Inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie, its stock didn't trade and the company forecast a "significant" drop next year in sales of its core product.
That disclosure came, a Delmed spokeswoman said 0 *?*, after the American Stock Exchange alerted the company that trading wouldn't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided *-2.
In addition to the forecast, the company also said 0 it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead.
The spokeswoman said 0 the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today.
Delmed, which *T*-1 makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used * in *PRO* treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of Leslie I. Shapiro, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
They were succeeded *-1 by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, which *T*-2 owns about 45% of Delmed.
At the same time, the New Brunswick, N.J., company said 0 negotiations about pricing and volumes of product *ICH*-1 had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the U.S., National Medical Care Inc.
Following that announcement Tuesday, however, company officials were unavailable *PRO*-1 to elaborate.
Yesterday, the spokeswoman said 0 sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87% of Delmed's 1988 sales of $21.1 million *U*.
The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although Delmed said 0 it will continue *-1 to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical, the spokeswoman said 0 *T*-2.
Nonetheless, "Delmed currently expects that 1990 sales...will be significantly below their 1989 level," the company said 0 *T*-1 in a statement.
Delmed said yesterday that Fresenius USA would begin *-1 distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels.
In any case, supplies to patients won't be interrupted *-1, the company added 0 *T*-2.
Fresenius, a West German pharmaceutical concern, has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy Delmed stock for cash *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80% *U*.
The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed.
But the plan now is being "reformulated *-3," Delmed said *T*-1, *PRO*-4 declining *PRO*-2 to provide most of the new terms of the combination.
Said *ICH*-1 the spokeswoman: "The whole structure has changed.
The value of the company has changed."
Delmed did say that the proposal still would infuse cash *ICH*-1 into Delmed but less than the $10 million *U* originally expected *.
Delmed also would receive the North American rights to certain Fresenius AG products.
Another option for Delmed, the company said 0 *?*, is that it could sell its plant in Ogden, Utah.
It added that no discussions about such a sale are under way.
A few years ago, I was on a panel of journalists that *T*-1 discussed the "image" of intercollegiate athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others.
We scribblers quickly concurred that not only was the bad rep of big - time college sports richly earned *-2, but also that it could be corrected *-1.
Competition could be maintained *-2--and stadiums probably would remain full--if schedules were reduced *-3 and the games returned *-5 to the students, we said 0 *T*-4.
Comments from the audience reflected widespread, if wistful, agreement with those conclusions.
As the session broke up, I was approached *-1 by a man who *T*-2 identified himself as the alumni director of a Big Ten university.
"I'd love *PRO*-1 to see sports cut back, and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools, but everybody's afraid *PRO*-2 to make the first move," he confided *T*-3.
"It's like the U.S. and the Russians: Nobody wants *PRO*-1 to disarm first."
And so our institutions of higher learning lurch from scandal to scandal on gridiron and basketball court, while the casualties mount.
Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college - sports show can be the integrity of the schools that *T*-1 stage it.
They are: "A Payroll 0 *PRO* to Meet *T*-1: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (Macmillan, 221 pages, $18.95 *U*) by David Whitford; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95 *U*) by Armen Keteyian; and "Never Too Young *PRO* to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (Pantheon, 252 pages, $18.95 *U*) by Lewis Cole.
The pick of the group is "Payroll"; it should be required reading for every college president.
It chronicles how, over a period of a dozen years, Southern Methodist University bought its way to football respectability in the Southwest Conference, *PRO*-3 only to find itself trapped and strangled * by the athlete - payoff system 0 it created *T*-1 *T*-2.
The school was the first *ICH*-2, in 1987, 0 *T*-1 to receive the NCAA's "death penalty"--two years without football--for repeated rules violations.
Given current headlines about the University of Florida, it may not be the last.
The man who *T*-1 brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer, a flashy sort who *T*-2 came in 1975 *PRO*-4 to rescue a woebegone program, Mr. Whitford writes 0 *T*-3.
Mr. Meyer's personal style was illustrated *-1 by his pinning a $100 *U* bill to a high - school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards *T*-2.
One recruiter working with Mr. Meyer was so generous with $10 and $20 *U* bills that prospects sang "Here Comes *T*-2 Santa Claus" when he approached *T*-1.
*PRO* Paying players at SMU was no casual operation.
It involved the athletics director, two different football coaching staffs, and school trustees and governors--just about everybody, it seemed, but Donald Shields, the university's president.
There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, *PRO*-2 having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees *T*-1.
"You stay out of it," author Whitford quotes Mr. Clements as *PRO*-2 saying *T*-1.
"*PRO* Go run the university."
Which *T*-1 was about what Mr. Shields did *T*-2, and quietly, until he resigned a few years later, *PRO*-4 pleading ill health, when the stuff hit the fan *T*-3.
Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal, and on a university internal investigation.
Mr. Keteyian had *-3 to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football, which *T*-2 is, to date, high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned *-1.
Unfortunately, he gets low grades as an investigative reporter, *PRO*-2 relying heavily on what Chicago's late mayor, Richard J. Daley, called *T*-1 "*PRO*-3 insinuendo."
Discrepancies go unexplained in "Confidential" (one ex-player claims 0 he received $4,000 to $5,000 *U* for his season football tickets while others said 0 theirs brought only a few hundred dollars), and when Mr. Keteyian can't nail down something, like who *T*-2 really owned a car driven * by Husker tailback Doug Dubose *T*-1, he simply reprints his notes.
There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between Husker players and a low - level female university employee.
A serious charge--that star flanker Irving Fryar "threw" the 1984 Orange Bowl game by *PRO*-2 intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone--is included *-1, even though the Nebraska assistant coach quoted * denied *PRO*-3 making it.
Still, the book produces more smoke than a smoldering sofa, along with a few flames, especially concerning the use of steroids.
Dean Steinkuhler, a spectacularly bulked - up former lineman, confesses that he used 'em, and says 0 other Huskers did *?* too.
It *EXP*-2's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches *T*-1.
Probably, it didn't *?*.
"Never Too Young" is a different sort of work, *PRO*-1 focusing on the 1986 death from cocaine ingestion of Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star ticketed * for sure pro stardom.
While the university was *PRO* no more *ICH*-1 to blame *-2 for that than for the similar fate of any other student, it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath.
Bias's coach, Lefty Driesell, ordered the room in which Bias died *T*-2 to be cleaned *-3 before the police could arrive (the order wasn't carried *-1 out), and the school's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players.
Those, of course, were the responses of people with something 0 *PRO* to hide *T*-1.
One wonders how other college athletic officials would behave under the same circumstances *T*-1.
Tomorrow's "On Sports" column will look at another aspect of the college sports mess.
Rochester Telephone Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Viroqua Telephone Co. of Viroqua, Wis.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Rochester will exchange shares of its common stock for all shares outstanding of Viroqua Telephone, a family - owned company.
Viroqua serves about 3,000 access lines in western Wisconsin.
C.B. Rogers Jr. was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chief executive officer of this business information concern.
Mr. Rogers, 60 years old, succeeds J.V. White, 64, who *T*-1 will remain chairman and chairman of the executive committee.
Mr. Rogers, who *T*-1 was president and chief operating officer of Equifax, will retain his position as president.
The company said 0 a new chief operating officer won't be appointed *-1.
C. Hyde Tucker will become president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic International Inc., a unit of this telecommunications concern, effective Jan. 1.
Mr. Tucker, 56 years old, is currently vice president and chief operating officer of Bell Atlantic's C&P Telephone unit.
Mr. Tucker will succeed Salvatore J. Barbera, 64, who *T*-1 will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement April 1.
David Evans, who last week *T*-1 resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. "for personal reasons" just as the company filed for bankruptcy - law protection, has been temporarily reappointed *-3 to both positions, the company said 0 *T*-2.
Qintex Entertainment also said 0 Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd, 37 years old, would join the nine - member board.
He succeeds Roger Kimmel, who *T*-1 resigned last week *PRO*-2 saying 0 his participation in *PRO* evaluating the company's role in *PRO* buying MGM / UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary.
Mr. Evans will stay until a successor is found *-1, but not later than the end of the year, the company said 0 *T*-2.
It was the 49 - year - old Mr. Evans who *T*-1 had moved into the offices of MGM / UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd.'s aborted bid for the movie company.
After MGM / UA terminated the $1.5 billion *U* merger because of a dispute over a $50 million *U* letter of credit, Qintex Entertainment--which *T*-1 is 43% - owned by Qintex Australia--found itself facing problems of its own.
And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears *-1 to be quickly deteriorating.
On Oct. 19, Qintex Entertainment was about *-1 to default on a $5.9 million *U* payment owed * to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program.
Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia *PRO*-1 to arrange financing.
But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, Mr. Evans said 0 he believed 0 Qintex Australia wouldn't be forthcoming.
He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions.
But a majority of the board, which *T*-1 includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him.
Mr. Evans resigned.
Later in the day, according to the source, the board reversed itself, decided *PRO*-1 to file for bankruptcy protection, and asked Mr. Evans *PRO*-2 to stay on.
Mr. Evans told the board 0 he needed the weekend *PRO*-1 to think about it.
Mr. Evans couldn't be reached *-1 yesterday for comment.
Last Monday, Qintex Australia announced a restructuring plan and said 0 it would sell off assets.
Last week the company indicated 0 it would cut back on the working capital 0 it would supply *T*-1 to Qintex Entertainment.
Separately, a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles *PRO*-1 charging Qintex Australia with *PRO*-2 misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment's financial position.
Qintex Australia said 0 it hadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment.
Robert H. Knight's Oct. 5 editorial - page article bemoaning violence in comedy movies ("Hollywood, You Slay Me") is interesting, but somewhat off - base.
As a fan of older movies from the 1920s on, I do not find 0 modern comedies contain violence, sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies.
Older movies have plenty of violence, though it is portrayed *-1 in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time.
For example, one of my favorite movies is the 1949 British comedy "Kind Hearts and Coronets," in which the entire comedy is based *-1 on actor Dennis Price's murdering eight titled relatives (all played *-3 by Alec Guinness) because they snubbed his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title *T*-2.
Similarly, one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the "murder mystery / comedy."
The "Thin Man" series of movies, as well as many others, based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered *-1.
Further, I think 0 Mr. Knight made a poor choice in *PRO*-1 picking "A Fish Called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Wanda" as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies.
The specific scene 0 he mentions *T*-3 in which pet dogs are crushed *-1 *T*-4 is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that *T*-2 befall the coyote in the old Warner Bros . "Road Runner" cartoons.
There is no slow - motion close - up, blood - and - guts portrayal of the animal's demise.
*PRO* Keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is flattened *-1 by a steamroller *PRO*-1 only to pop right back up and peer in the window of a Boeing 747--from the outside--as it takes off *T*-2.
I will be the first 0 *T*-2 to agree that there is much 0 *T*-3 to be found *-1 wrong with modern movie making.
Many modern scriptwriters seem *-1 to be incapable of *PRO*-2 writing drama, or anything else, without foul - mouthed cursing.
Sex and violence are routinely included *-2 even when they are irrelevant to the script *T*-1, and high - tech special effects are continually substituted *-3 for good plot and character development.
In short, we have a movie and television industry that *T*-14 is either incapable or petrified of *PRO*-1 making a movie unless it carries a PG - 13 or R rating.
Hence copious amounts of gratuitous sex, violence and gutter language are included *-1 as a crutch.
However, these faults are not the exclusive property of modern comedies, and I believe 0 Mr. Knight errs when he attempts *PRO*-2 to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making *T*-1.

This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System, and some members of Congress think 0 it's time 0 *PRO* to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank *T*-1.
After 75 years there may be a few things that *T*-1 are worth *PRO* reexamining.
The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup, for instance, may be out of date.
In earlier years it *EXP*-1 may have seemed *-2 reasonable *PRO* to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed.
Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism; the Fed, after all, is a national central bank.
Some of the *PRO* would - be reformers, however, want *PRO*-1 to restore an arrangement 0 we once had *T*-2--or, at least, part of it.
In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.
But in 1935, when Congress was trying *PRO*-2 to find someone or something 0 *PRO* to blame *T*-4 for the Great Depression *T*-1, it decided *PRO*-3 to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board.
Carter Glass, a former treasury secretary who *T*-1 was then back in Congress, probably influenced the decision.
He said that when he was on the board *T*-1 he felt that he had a great deal of power and, somehow, he didn't think 0 that was a good thing.
Times have changed.
Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D .) has introduced a bill *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 in Congress, co-sponsored * by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), that *T*-3 would put the treasury secretary back on the board.
There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something.
So far no one has suggested *PRO* putting the comptroller back on the board.
Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposal, and he doesn't like it much.
Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics, *PRO*-1 dropping the seat - for - the - secretary idea.
That may have pleased the secretary, but H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure 0 he already has all the power 0 he needs *T*-1.
Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of course.
He was, in fact, taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury.
After the October 1987 market crash, Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that *T*-2 tried *PRO*-5 to decide what *T*-3 went wrong and what *T*-4 should be done *-1 about it.
One of the commission's recommendations was that a single agency, probably the Federal Reserve, should coordinate regulation of all financial markets.
This recommendation might have encouraged a turf - hungry bureaucrat to try *PRO*-1 to expand his power, but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job.
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears *-1 to have handled them well.
Mr. Brady has said 0 he thought 0 government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared *PRO*-2 to coordinate their actions, but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas 0 the commission advanced *T*-1 nearly two years ago.
In recent weeks, moreover, Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-1 to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates.
The urging admittedly has been gentle.
In an interview with the Washington Post in early October, the secretary said 0 the Fed may be slightly more interested in *PRO*-1 curbing inflation than the administration is *?*, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on *PRO* spurring economic growth.
At least some economists, of course, would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis.
Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference *PRO*-1 to assess the system's first 75 years.
Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie - Mellon University economist, noted that the Fed's record included the longest, most sustained, peacetime inflation in our history, dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989.
The inflation - growth argument is an old one, but Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying *PRO*-2 to influence Fed policy.
Equally importantly, the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort *PRO* to bring the U.S. dollar down by *PRO* shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen.
The treasury can do something on its own, but *PRO*-1 to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed.
The central bank has been helping, but apparently not especially eagerly.
The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets, all right, but through August, at least, it appeared *-1 to be "sterilizing" the intervention.
In other words, it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by *PRO*-1 buying dollars in the domestic money market.
Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect.
When traders see 0 the Fed is in the exchange market *T*-1 it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do *T*-2.
But it's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values.
After August the Fed may have stopped *-1 sterilizing, but it *EXP*-3's hard *PRO* to see much impact on the dollar.
The dollar is still highly volatile.
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know *T*-1.
Earlier this year, Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, argued forcefully that a government that *T*-1 wants steady, stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies.
*PRO* Trying *PRO*-1 to manage exchange rates to some desired level, he said 0 *?*, "would mean *PRO* diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation."
The more we think about it, the more we suspect 0 Mr. Brady does indeed have enough power where he already is *T*-1.
This British banking and financial - services group's investment - banking arm, Barclays de Zoete Wedd Group, announced the following appointments at its merchant - banking subsidiary Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
John Padovan, 51 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a deputy chairman.
Mr. Padovan is currently a director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
Graham Pimlott, 40, was named *-1 to the new post of chief executive officer of the merchant - banking corporate - finance division.
Callum McCarthy, 45, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 to the new post of deputy head of the corporate - finance division and a managing director.
Mr. Pimlott and Mr. McCarthy join Barclay's from Kleinwort Benson Ltd. where they served as directors *T*-2.
ARTICLE I, SECTION 7, CLAUSE 2:
Every Bill which *T*-2 shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented *-1 to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated *T*-4, who *T*-3 shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed *PRO*-5 to reconsider it.
If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree *PRO*-3 to pass the Bill, it shall be sent *-1, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered *-2 *T*-4, and if *PRO*-5 approved *-6 by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law....

Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary *T*-5 (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented *-1 to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved *-1 by him, or *PRO*-1 being disapproved *-2 by him, shall be repassed *-1 by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed * in the Case of a Bill.
President Bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case *PRO*-1 to see whether he already has the line - item veto.
Vice President Quayle and Budget Director Darman said recently 0 they've joined the search.
On Tuesday, the subject came up again when Marlin Fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based * on the provisions above to the White House press corps *T*-1.
President Bush doesn't have any provision in mind, but line - item - veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing Resolution.
The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. Bush's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law.
We have been persuaded *-1 by the constitutional argument for the inherent line - item veto since 1987, when lawyer Stephen Glazier first made the case on this page *T*-2.
The 1974 budget "reform," *PRO*-1 passed over President Nixon's veto, took away the presidential impoundment power, *PRO* thereby introducing monstrous CRs and eviscerating the presidential veto.
Mr. Glazier discovered that the Founders had worried that Congress might take the President out of the loop.
Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 says that whether it's called *-1 *PRO*-2 an "order, resolution or vote" or anything else, Presidents must have the chance *PRO* to veto.
*PRO* Labeling an omnibus budget *PRO*-1 a "bill" can't deprive the President of his power *PRO* to veto items.
*PRO* Finding a test case shouldn't be hard, but there is something 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1 for *PRO* picking the best one possible.
The White House had the perfect case, but Congress blinked before it could go to court.
After the HUD and S&L stories broke, some Congressmen began *-1 to worry that their influence peddling at executive - branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble.
They worried about an Interior Department directive *PRO* to log all communications with Members or their staffs.
Congress inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: "None of the funds available under this title may be used *-1 *PRO* to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the Dept. of the Interior and Members and committees of Congress and their staff."
The White House warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power.
When it threatened *PRO*-2 to use this provision as the test for a line - item veto *T*-1, Congress caved.
The fear 0 Congress has *T*-1 of any line - item - veto test led Members *PRO*-2 to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989."
This means 0 Interior contacts cannot be logged *-1 only on one day--a Sunday that *T*-2 had already passed.
If the White House is looking for another unconstitutional bill, Rep. John Dingell is trying again *PRO*-1 to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead.
President Reagan vetoed this as a First Amendment violation.
The "Fairness" Doctrine's enthusiasts are incumbents in the House who *T*-1 know 0 the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts, *PRO* deterring feisty challengers.
There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen *PRO*-1 to join treaty - negotiating teams and new restrictions on OMB.
Unconstitutional bills make good legal targets, but the line - item veto is better *ICH*-2 understood *-1 as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers.
*PRO*-1 Commenting on the budget mess this week, President Bush said: "The perception out there is that it's the fault of Congress.
And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people *T*-1."
Exactly right.
Now's *T*-3 the time 0 *PRO* to make the political case that Presidents need the line - item weapon *PRO*-2 to restore discipline to the budget *T*-1.
Congress is in no position 0 *PRO* to naysay Mr. Bush *T*-2 now that we're into Gramm - Rudman's sequestration.
Just this week, the House - Senate conference *ICH*-4 met--231 conferees, divided * into 26 different subconferences.
Senator Daniel Inouye agreed *PRO*-1 to close some bases in Hawaii in exchange for such goodies as $11 million *U* for a parking lot at Walter Reed Hospital.
Conference negotiator Rep. Bill Hefner pulled down $40 million *U* in military bases for North Carolina and graciously allowed Senator James Sasser $70 million *U* for bases in Tennessee.
President Bush should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get *PRO*-1 to work.
He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork.
Congress may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean 0 the country must learn *PRO*-1 to live forever with this mess.
President Bush has the power *PRO*-1 to change how Washington works *T*-2, if only he will use it.
SHORT INTEREST in International Mobile Machines Corp. fell to 3,102,935 shares in the month ended Oct. 13 from 3,420,936 in September.
Because of an error by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday's edition.
Legal controversies in America have a way of *PRO* assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what *T*-2 is involved *-1 in the particular case.
They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment.
It has always been so.
In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, volunteered *PRO*-1 to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored * by the American Civil Liberties Union *PRO* to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed * by the Tennessee Legislature.
The result was a world - famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the "smart set," whose spokesman *T*-1 was H.L. Mencken, and the religious fundamentalists, whom Mencken derided *T*-2 as benighted primitives.
Few now recall the actual outcome: Scopes was convicted *-2 and fined *-2 $100 *U*, and his conviction was reversed *-1 on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law.
So it was *T*-3 with the Hiss case a generation later, when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal 0 he had served *T*-1 *T*-2.
His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets 0 he allegedly had passed *T*-1 to Soviet intelligence.
And so it seems *-1 to be *T*-2 with the case of Elizabeth Morgan, the Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon jailed * in a child custody case for *PRO*-3 refusing *PRO*-4 to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.
Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, *PRO*-1 a heroine to her many supporters.
To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle.
It is what lawyers call *T*-1 "*PRO*-2 fact intensive."
It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt.
Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who *T*-1 did what to whom."
It *EXP*-3 is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who *T*-2 has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy.
Certainly I do not *?*.
So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power 0 this case has exerted *T*-1 over the minds of many, not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world.
I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan.
The first is that it represents an intense battle in what James Thurber used *-1 to caricature *T*-2 as "the war between the sexes."
But although Thurber did so gently and lightheartedly, many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.
The vehemence of the emotions aroused * by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted *T*-1 as an eternal part of the human condition.
A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case.
Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who *T*-1 attended some of the "best" schools.
As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that *T*-1 freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working - class woman, Congress would have rushed *PRO*-2 to pass a private relief bill freeing her?
Or that the president would have hurried *PRO*-1 to sign the bill "out of compassion for her plight"?
*PRO* To ask those questions is *PRO* to answer them.
Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity *PRO* to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes--*PRO* bashing the District of Columbia government.
The local government is discredited *-2 in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons, and congressmen read the same newspapers *RNR*-1 and watch the same TV newscasts *RNR*-1 as other people in the area do *?*.
*PRO* Bashing the D.C. government is risk - free for members of Congress, who *T*-1 do not have *-2 to answer to their own constituents for it.
Congress is paralyzed *-1 from *PRO*-2 acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit.
Yet a bill tailored * to the interests of a single individual passed Congress with almost unimaginable speed, before the judicial process had run its course, and, indeed, while the Morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court.
The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does *?* about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.
It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue *-2 to be *T*-1 however we try *PRO*-3 to deny their existence *T*-4.

NORTH SIDE SAVINGS BANK directors declared an initial dividend of 10 cents a share, payable Dec. 5 to stock of record Nov. 21.
The Floral Park, N.Y., thrift has a strong capital - to - assets ratio, said 0 *T*-1 Vice President Michael D.N. Confer.
At Sept. 30, the thrift, which *T*-1 converted to a stock form of ownership from a mutual form in April 1986, had more than four million shares outstanding.
*PRO* Call Jim Wright's office in downtown Fort Worth, Texas, these days and the receptionist still answers the phone, "Speaker Wright's office."
The former congressman, who *T*-2 resigned as speaker of the House after an investigation of his financial dealings, is ensconced *-1 in his district office, maintained * by taxpayers on a $200,000 *U* allowance.
He is negotiating a rich book contract to boot.
One of the hottest tickets on Washington's social calendar this fall was a charity benefit honoring former Congressman Tony Coelho, who *T*-1 landed a million - dollar job on Wall Street after *PRO*-2 resigning over a controversial junk - bond investment last summer.
Michael Deaver, the former White House aide, has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here.
Mr. Deaver has reopened a public - relations business.
*PRO* Surviving scandal has become a rite of political passage at a time when a glut of scandal has blunted this town's sensibility *T*-1.
*PRO* Let the president demand strict new ethics rules: With four sitting House members accused * of sexual misdeeds, amid the unfolding HUD scandal and after the Wright debacle, "people are slightly dulled *-2 by scandal," says 0 *T*-1 political humorist Art Buchwald.
"It now takes something really weird *PRO* to inspire public outrage."
Not all the scandal - tripped have enjoyed soft landings.
But many have *?*.
"These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people," says *T*-2 Washington writer Suzanne Garment, who *T*-1 is working on a history of post-Watergate scandal.
*PRO* Given their own penchant for book writing, it *EXP*-1 is surprising that none of the masters of scandal survival have yet published a guide to the art.
For there is an emerging protocol--indeed, an etiquette--to it.
Among the rules:
*PRO* Pretend 0 Nothing Happened
As if he were still in his old job, Mr. Wright, by *PRO*-2 resigning with his title instead of being forced *-1 from his job, by law enjoys a $120,000 *U* annual office expense allowance, three paid staffers, up to $67,000 *U* for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege.
*PRO* Not to mention a generous federal pension.
There is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $10,000 *U* a pop, at tony places including the Yale Political Union.
"He's as busy as he was *?* as speaker," reports *T*-1 Mr. Wright's administrative aide, Larry Shannon.
*PRO* Atone
On the edge of fashionable Georgetown, in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom he won't name *T*-1, Mr. Deaver is trying *PRO*-2 to reclaim his reputation as one of the savviest image makers in town.
There are few mementos of his days as White House deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.
The former $3 million - *U* a - year lobbyist now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of his time *PRO*-1 counseling other recovering alcoholics.
"I feel better than I ever have *?* in my life," he says *T*-1.
Mr. Deaver confessed to his alcoholism during his trial on perjury charges.
He is also a recovering workaholic, *PRO*-2 relaxing with his family and creating topiary, or garden - shrub sculpture, a fashionable pursuit for which he developed a passion *T*-1 during his three - year legal ordeal.
One sign of Mr. Deaver's renaissance: an appearance on ABC's "Nightline" for a show on pack journalism.
Host Ted Koppel introduced him as "the media master of the Reagan Administration," with nary a mention of Mr. Deaver's conviction in 1987 on perjury charges.
*PRO* Finding God
"When someone says, ` I've turned to God *T*-1,' everybody lays off," observes *T*-2 Frank Mankiewicz, an old Washington hand and former aide to Robert Kennedy.
Thus have Charles Colson and Jeb Magruder launched successful post-Watergate careers at the pulpit.
But it doesn't always work so smoothly.
After allegations *ICH*-1 surfaced in a 1985 divorce contest that he had beaten his wife, SEC enforcement chief John Fedders retreated to a Trappist monastery in rural Virginia.
He is now in solo law practice in Washington, but his fees have been meager and he failed in efforts *PRO* to win a chunk of his ex-wife's royalties on her *PRO* tell - all book.
From time to time he returns to the monastery for prayer, meditation and pro bono legal work.
Mr. Fedders is philosophical about his travails.
"This whole experience has been an opportunity for internal growth," he says *T*-1.
He sees a psychoanalyst five mornings a week.
"I've surrendered to the circumstances," Mr. Fedders says *T*-1.
"The word surrender has a precise psychoanalytic meaning.
My universe has changed.
I'm enjoying my life and who I am *T*-1 today.
The aspect of *PRO* being a mega-lawyer isn't as important."
*PRO* Don't Linger
"The best thing 0 you can do *T*-1 is get off the screen," says *T*-2 Mr. Buchwald.
Nobody proved that more masterfully than Mr. Coelho, the former Democratic majority whip.
*PRO*-1 Declaring that there was life after Congress, he resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a 1986 junk - bond investment, before any official investigations took hold.
Among the glitterati who *T*-1 turned out in bipartisan black - tie force *PRO*-3 to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were *T*-2 Sen. Robert Dole, Rep. Newt Gingrich, and other kingpins of Congress.
Dan Rather served as emcee.
From his new, million - dollar - a - year perch on Wall Street as a managing director of Wertheim Schroder & Co., Mr. Coelho reports that many of his former colleagues have contacted him *PRO*-2 to find out how they, too, can pursue investment banking careers *T*-1.
It *EXP*-1 Helps *PRO* to Be Male
Male scandal victims invariably fare better.
Anne Burford, the former EPA chief who *T*-2 resigned under fire in 1983 during a flap with Congress, was kayoed *-1 in the confrontation, even though she was never charged *-3 with official wrondgoing.
She worked part - time as a consultant and wrote a book, but never restarted her high - powered legal career.
It didn't help when, in 1986, she was charged *-2 *RNR*-3 (and then cleared *-2 *RNR*-3) on allegations of public drunkenness *T*-1.
"I cut my losses and ran," she says *T*-1, from her new home in Colorado, where she is busy *PRO*-3 remodeling *T*-2.
Mrs. Burford remains bitter over the overwhelming legal expenses involved * in *PRO* clearing her name.
"My husband was instantly impoverished *-2 by the very act of *PRO* marrying me," she says *T*-1.
Another former EPA official, Rita Lavelle, is still struggling after her conviction in 1983 on perjury charges.
"There's nothing 0 she could do *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to bring herself back to where she was *T*-2," says *T*-4 her lawyer, James Bierbower.
"You could say 0 she survived, but it wasn't easy on her."
No book contracts have been dangled *-1 before Deborah Gore Dean, the reigning queen of the HUD scandal.
Donna Rice of Gary Hart fame failed *-1 to obtain a book contract and lost her modeling contract for "No Excuses" jeans.
Fawn Hall, Oliver North's former secretary, has yet *-1 to launch a hoped - for television news career, according to her lawyer.
Rita Jenrette, the former wife of Abscam - indicted Rep. John Jenrette, has yet *-1 to hit it big in Hollywood, although with roles in such movies as "Zombie Island Massacre" and "Aunt Ida's Bikini Shop," she is doing a lot better than her former husband.
He was back in jail over the summer on shoplifting charges.
*PRO* Be the Star
Central figures--such as Richard Nixon--usually fare better than those with supporting roles.
Richard Secord, the retired Air Force general felled * in the Iran - Contra scandal, is all but ruined--*PRO*-1 forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to sell his Virginia home and pull his kids out of college, according to a recent fund - raising appeal sent * out on his behalf.
Yet his co-defendant in the case--also a former military officer by the name of Oliver North--has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in the affair.
What *T*-1 accounts for the difference?
During the televised Iran - Contra hearings, Mr. North came off as a patriot from central casting.
Mr. Secord's performance was decidedly less inspiring.
Mr. North remains in heavy demand as a speaker, for fees reported * in the $20,000 *U* range.
Even in the wake of Hurricane Hugo 750 people turned out in a remote Virginia town in September for a "family tribute" to Mr. North given * by two dozen conservative members of Congress.
If Sex Is Involved, All Bets Are Off
Sex scandals make people look careless and silly, and one of the worst sins in Washington is *PRO* to be laughed at *-1.
"You can be wicked, but not foolish," says *T*-1 Mr. Mankiewicz.
Nevertheless, Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts was handily re-elected *-2 because of the candor with which he handled revelations that he had sex with a male congressional page in 1983 *T*-1.
Former Rep. Robert Bauman, a Maryland Republican who *T*-1 lost his seat in 1980 after he was caught *-2 *PRO*-3 soliciting sex from a 16 - year - old boy, has never regained his professional footing as a lawyer.
Mr. Bauman, a conservative, says 0 he was deserted *-1 by the right wing.
"Conservatives shoot their own," he says *T*-1.
If the political establishment is reluctant *PRO*-1 to forgive sexual misadventures, the private sector sometimes will *?*.
John Tower was accused *-1 of womanizing and boozing during his unsuccessful bid *PRO* to win confirmation as secretary of defense earlier this year.
Now he is writing a book, serving on an elite foreign policy advisory board and consulting for an array of corporate clients, including British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell.
*PRO* Become a Lobbyist
When all else fails *T*-1, Gucci Gulch--the fabled halls of the Capitol inhabited * by lobbyists and their imported shoes--offers a welcome environment for fallen officials.
Former Rep. Fernand St Germain, brought * down by the savings - and - loan crisis, now represents--you guessed it--savings - and - loans associations.
Some become pseudo-lobbyists.
John Mack promptly quit his job *ICH*-2 last spring as an aide to Speaker Wright amid public outrage over Mr. Mack's violent attack on a young woman when he was 19 years old *T*-1.
After a few weeks in seclusion, Mr. Mack opened a consulting firm, but not *PRO* to enable him *PRO*-3 to directly lobby; that would require him *PRO*-2 to disclose his clients by *PRO* registering as a lobbyist.
Still, Mr. Mack says 0 he talks to "30 members of Congress a week."
Misery Loves Company
Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace.
Raymond Donovan, the New Jersey construction executive who *T*-1 was forced *-2 *PRO*-5 to resign as labor secretary and indicted *-2 in 1985, only *PRO*-2 to be acquitted *-3 of fraud charges, often calls other scandal - tossed public figures *PRO*-4 to offer a sympathetic ear.
Each time 0 a new scandal hits *T*-1, he says 0 *?*, "it pulls the scabs off your knees."
One of the first people 0 *T*-2 to come to the Deaver home after his troubles erupted was former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman, whom Mr. Deaver scarcely knew *T*-1.
"He reassured me that the hurricane would end," Mr. Deaver recalls *T*-1.
Mr. Bauman received an encouraging letter from the recognized master of scandal survival, Richard Nixon.
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Bauman: "If things get really tough, I can always auction it off at Sotheby's.
Western European leaders who *T*-3 favor speedy economic and monetary union are adding a new argument *ICH*-2 to their arsenal: the dizzying political changes under way in Eastern Europe.
French President Francois Mitterrand, European Community Commission President Jacques Delors, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and others have begun *-1 linking the rapid changes in the East to the need *PRO* to speed up changes in the West.
They are stressing that the best way 0 for the West to help the East *T*-1 is *PRO* to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity.
This would make the market - oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries, they argue 0 *?*, and allow greater economic aid and technological know - how to flow from West to East.
"The only response to the challenge being presented * to us by the East," Mr. Mitterrand told *?* the European Parliament in Strasbourg yesterday, "is *PRO* to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community."
Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened *-1 next fall *PRO* to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified *-2 by 1992.
Mr. Mitterrand also proposed a separate "Bank for Europe" that *T*-1 would channel development money to the East.
One basis for *PRO* linking change in the East and change in the West is the notion that *PRO* integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the U.S.'s obvious strategic and economic interest.
Says *ICH*-2 a European strategist: "The U.S. tends *-1 to look at Eastern Europe {not including the Soviet Union} as Europe looks at Latin America: important but far away.
But for us in Western Europe, these are Europeans next door."
A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40 - year - old military and economic policies.
There is likely *-1 to be a natural division of labor, says 0 *?* Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union, and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East.
The designation at July's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the EC Commission as coordinator of Western aid to Poland and Hungary was a first step.
In part, this division is dictated *-1 by economics: West Germany is a net exporter of capital while the U.S. isn't *?*.
While American aid efforts have been limited *-1 by budget problems, yesterday France announced a three - year, four billion French franc ($650 million *U*) aid plan for Poland.
Despite sudden changes in the strategic equation, some Western European leaders, especially British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, remain skeptical about European political and economic unity, and are unlikely *-1 to let East - West concerns change their minds.
But British analysts are beginning *-1 to link the issues.
"We need a Western Ostpolitik," says *T*-1 John Roper, of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, *PRO*-2 referring to West Germany's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the East.
"For Poland and Hungary we need *-2 to think about a stick - and - carrot economic approach that *T*-1 would force them *PRO*-3 to price things realistically in return for *PRO* removing all our tariff barriers."
He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe "didn't just throw money at post-war Europe, it also liberalized *RNR*-1 and opened up *RNR*-1 those markets."
The French analysis goes further.
"Most of the West's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of economic restructuring} to succeed," says *T*-1 Hubert Vedrine, security adviser to Mr. Mitterrand.
"But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions."
He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling *PRO*-2 to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, "Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need *-1 to help him, and not just with words."
*PRO* Managing change, he adds 0 *?*, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC, especially in *PRO* dealing with the question of German reunification.
Thierry de Montbrial, director of the French Institutue for International Relations in Paris, says 0 it *EXP*-2 isn't clear what, exactly, West Germany wants *T*-1.
Any push for a Gorbachev vision of a "common European home," implying the eventual dissolution of the EC, a Soviet - German partnership and the withdrawal of U.S. forces, "would be a very, very serious problem," he says 0 *T*-1.
He doubts 0 a Bismarckian super state *ICH*-3 will emerge that *T*-1 would dominate Europe, but warns of "a risk of profound change in the heart of the European Community from a Germany that *T*-2 is too strong, even if *PRO*-4 democratic."
He adds: "We, and the rest of the EC have *-1 to talk to the Germans, now, frankly and raise these future risks with them."
While many commentators, particularly French ones, worry that hasty and emotional reaction to the changes in the East might lead to dangerous pressures for a denuclearized Europe or the speeded - up withdrawal of American troops, Mr. Roper in London sees a more positive scenario.
"There seems *-1 to be a message *ICH*-3 from Moscow 0 there's a deal on offer," he says *T*-2.
"They want reassurance 0 we won't try *PRO*-2 to undermine or destroy the Warsaw Pact....
In return, the U.K. and France could keep their nuclear weapons.
He adds: "Once both sides feel comfortable, it *EXP*-2 should be that much easier *PRO* to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that *T*-1 are now starting in the East.
A merchant bank and investment fund have agreed *PRO*-1 to co-sponsor a reorganization plan *PRO* to bring Sharon Steel Corp. out of Chapter 11 proceedings and to acquire the company's steel - related assets in a transaction valued * at more than $300 million *U*.
Castle Harlan Inc., a New York merchant bank, and Quantum Fund said 0 they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of Sharon's liabilities.
The balance of the company's assets and liabilities would be transferred *-1 to a new company that *T*-3 would be owned *-2 by Sharon's creditors.
Quantum said 0 it has agreed *PRO*-1 to purchase as much as $50 million *U* in equity in the new company, if necessary, for the confirmation of the plan.
Castle Harlan and Quantum said 0 the plan is expected *-2 to be filed *-1 within 60 days with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh.
The agreement is subject to certain conditions, including *PRO* obtaining financing.
Castle Harlan said that such financing is already being sought *-1 and that a formal proposal would be made *-2 to Sharon's Chapter 11 trustee and other Sharon creditors over the next few days.
Sharon, based * in Farrell, Pa., filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1987.
The company had been one of the maninstays of Miami Beach financier Victor Posner's empire.
Mr. Posner resigned as president and chief executive officer of Sharon in April 1988.
He remains chairman, but wields little power at the company.
Quantum Fund, based * in New York, is a $2.1 billion *U* investment fund managed * by Soros Fund Management.
Quantum is Sharon's largest unsecured creditor.
The Castle Harlan group includes Walter Sieckman, former chief operating officer of Sharon, and Wolfgang Jansen, former executive vice president.
Executives at Sharon declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the proposal.
The company's trustee, F.E. Agnew, was unavailable for comment.
Bell Atlantic Corp. said 0 it agreed definitively *PRO*-1 to acquire one of Control Data Corp.'s computer - maintenance businesses.
Terms of the accord weren't disclosed *-1.
Control Data's third - party maintenance unit services products primarily made * by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million *U*.
Under the agreement, which *T*-1 had been widely expected *-2, Bell Atlantic would be buying Control Data's customer base and its approximately 100 U.S. maintenance facilities in about 33 cities.
However, Control Data would continue *-1 to provide maintenance services for customers of its Cyber product line.
The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis - based Control Data's overall computer - servicing business, which last year *T*-1 posted sales of about $400 million *U*.
Earlier this year, the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $25 million *U*.
Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief operating officer, said 0 the maintenance business no longer fits into the company's "strategy *PRO* to be a data solutions company."
Thomas Vassiliades, president of Bell Atlantic's customer services division, said 0 the acquisition would give the company's Sorbus computer - maintenance unit added expertise in "the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high - end mainframe technologies.
Allied - Signal Aerospace Co. received a $65 million *U* contract *PRO* to outfit Continental Airlines' 393 planes with the Bendix / King Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System.
The airborne system operates *PRO*-1 independent of ground - based radar systems, *PRO*-1 informing pilots of nearby aircraft, Allied - Signal said 0 *T*-2.
The system also provides course - correction advisories.
Allied - Signal is a unit of Allied - Signal Inc., a manufacturer with interests in aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials.
Continental Airlines is a unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston.
Maggie Thatcher must be doing something right; her political enemies are screaming louder than ever.
Mrs. Thatcher, who *T*-1 was practicing the *PRO* read - my - lips school of politics years before Mr. Bush encountered it, has made clear her opposition to *PRO* refashioning Britain's free - market policies *PRO* to suit the bureaucrats in Brussels.
In return, Mrs. Thatcher is excoriated *-1 from Fleet Street to Paris as an obstructionist.
Well, it now turns out that Mrs. Thatcher had *-1 to travel across the globe to the 49 - member Commonwealth summit in Kuala Lumpur *PRO*-1 to discomfit the Holy Order of Consensus Builders.
"A disastrous farce in Malaysia," screamed *-1 the Manchester Guardian.
"She can no longer be trusted *-1 *PRO*-3 to behave in a civilised--that is unflaky--fashion when abroad *T*-2."
Egad.
Canada's Brian Mulroney and Australia's Bob Hawke, the paper said 0 *?*, were "enraged."
The London Times said 0 she had "contravened protocol."
As usual, her sin was saying what she thought *T*-1.
She issued a separate statement, *PRO*-1 separating herself from a Commonwealth document reasserting the political value of *PRO* imposing sanctions against South Africa.
While *PRO*-1 supporting the Commonwealth "in *PRO* utterly condemning apartheid," her statement urged it *PRO*-2 to "encourage change" rather than inflict further punishment on the country's black population.
Actually there is a consensus somewhere on sanctions: In May a Gallup Poll found that most South African blacks, 85%, oppose economic sanctions.
Still, Mrs. Thatcher had once again gone against the grain.
Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sniffed, "If everybody else puts out their left foot and you put out your right foot, you are out of step."
Mrs. Thatcher: "If it's one against 48, I'm very sorry for the 48."
If indeed Mrs. Thatcher has one opponent that *T*-1 could throw her off political course it is Britain's mysteriously intractable inflation problem.
We cannot, however, join the political chorus that *T*-2 as one proclaims how offputting it *EXP*-1 is *T*-3 that Mrs. Thatcher refuses *PRO*-4 to get along by *PRO*-5 going along.
It *EXP*-2 is refreshing *PRO* to see at least one world figure who *T*-3 knows what she believes in *T*-1 and is not inclined *PRO*-4 to reflexively compromise those beliefs.
Perhaps Mrs. Thatcher understands better than those distressed at her style that ultimately history and Britain's voters will decide who *T*-1 is right about Europe, *PRO* sanctioning South Africa or *PRO* running Britain's economy.
French consumer prices rose 0.2% in September from August, according to provisional estimates by the National Statistics Institute.
The agency noted that because of a strike by Finance Ministry personnel the provisional estimate doesn't correspond exactly to the consumer price index usually published *.
The agency noted, however, 0 the estimate will likely be confirmed *-1.
The institute didn't estimate annual price growth in September, but a 0.2% rise by the consumer price index would put growth at either 178.8 or 178.9, up 3.3% or 3.4% from the year - earlier level of 173.1.
The index was 178.5 in August and is based on 1980 equaling 100.
Federal health officials are expected *-1 today to approve a program granting long - deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Announcement of the approval is expected *T*-2 to be made *-1 by Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services.
The clearance by the Food and Drug Administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of AIDS to the only antiviral drug yet cleared *PRO* to treat the fatal disease.
The drug will be given *-1 treatment investigational new drug status, a label accorded * to drugs believed * effective but lacking formal approval.
The move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection.
Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since FDA approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987.
But despite more than two years of research showing 0 AZT can relieve dementia and other symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients.
As a result, many youngsters have been unable *PRO*-1 to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers won't cover its cost of $6,400 *U* a year.
So far, AIDS has stricken 1,859 children under age 13, with many times that number believed * to carry the infection without symptoms.
To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
Mothers of young AIDS patients expressed somber satisfaction.
"*PRO* Thank goodness 0 it's happening.
It should have happened sooner," said *T*-2 Elizabeth Glaser, a Los Angeles mother and activist who *T*-1 contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, and transmitted it to two of her children.
One of them, a daughter Ariel, died a year ago at age seven after her parents unsuccessfully pleaded for the drug.
"I could get AZT," says *T*-2 Mrs. Glaser, who *T*-1 bears her infection without any symptoms.
"But my daughter couldn't *?*, until she was too ill *PRO* to take it.
*PRO* To watch your child die is an inhuman experience."
Her son, *PRO*-1 healthy and symptom - free, currently takes no medication.
The delay in *PRO* getting AZT to children has been blamed *-1 on a combination of factors.
Traditionally, the medical establishment has waited two years *PRO*-1 to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses, because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape.
Secondly, critics have charged AZT's maker Burroughs Wellcome Co. with corporate inertia because children account for just 1% of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market.
Wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead *PRO*-2 to compile the relevant data, and recently promised *PRO*-1 to develop a pediatric syrup form easier 0 for youngsters to take *T*-3.
Still, all this comes nearly a year and a half after Philip Pizzo of the National Cancer Institute offered evidence that AZT could reverse the ravages of AIDS dementia, *PRO*-1 sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills.
Since then, roughly 50 pediatric patients have received the drug in his program.
To some mothers, the expected FDA action is a poignant reminder of what *T*-1 might have been.
"My first reaction is 0 I don't understand why it's taken so long *T*-1.
Why has it *EXP*-1 taken people so long for people to understand 0 pediatric AIDS is a major problem *T*-3?" asked *T*-4 Helen Kushnick, whose son Samuel *T*-2 died six years ago at age three, *PRO*-5 victim of a tainted transfusion.
Similar sentiments were voiced *-2 on Capitol Hill.
"While I'm pleased 0 the FDA is finally releasing AZT for children, it *EXP*-1's taken much too long *PRO* to get to this point," said *T*-2 Rep. Ted Weiss.
"Why did it *EXP*-2 take Burroughs Wellcome so long *PRO* to apply" for treatment investigational new drug status *T*-3? the New York Democrat asked *T*-1.
"*PRO* Let's not forget 0 this is the same company that *T*-1 has been profiteering with this drug for 2 1/2 years," Mr. Weiss added *T*-2.
Mrs. Glaser, who *T*-1 is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, based * in Santa Monica, Calif., condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot - dragging.
"There's no finger 0 *T*-2 to be pointed *-1," she said *T*-3.
"The crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well, and *PRO* to make sure 0 other experimental drugs, like Bristol - Myers Co.'s DDI, don't follow the same frustrating course as AZT."
AIDS dementia--which *T*-1 gradually steals children's ability *PRO* to speak, walk and think--is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome.
For some patients, AZT has restored the ability *PRO* to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles, *PRO* giving back a piece of their childhood if only temporarily.
"It *EXP*-3's impossible *PRO* to overstate how much this means *T*-4 to the families of these patients," said *T*-1 Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute and a main developer of AZT.
Kennametal Inc. said 0 it intends *PRO*-1 to acquire J&L America Inc. for $44 million *U* plus a consideration of as much as an additional $12 million *U*, payable over five years.
Kennametal is a carbide - products and cutting - tools company.
J&L, whose principal offices *T*-1 are in Detroit, is a mail - order distributer of industrial tools and supplies.
The acquisition is subject to approval by Kennametal's board.
House and Senate conferees agreed *PRO*-1 to continue production of Grumman Corp.'s F - 14 and to provide more than $3.8 billion *U* for the Strategic Defense Initiative during the current fiscal year.
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of a compromise defense authorization bill, hammered * out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days, provide a face - saving compromise for both the White House and House Democrats.
Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on the package, the final agreement could be announced *-1 as early as tomorrow.
An announcement is more likely next week, though.
President Bush and other supporters of SDI will be able *PRO*-2 to take credit for *PRO*-3 blocking House efforts *PRO* to significantly cut the program *PRO* to develop a space - based antimissile system, which *T*-1 already has cost some $17 billion *U*.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga .) and other Senate conferees have opposed the House cuts, *PRO*-1 stalling for almost two months action on a number of big - ticket items in the Pentagon's budget.
The Senate voted *PRO*-1 to authorize $4.5 billion *U* for SDI spending in the current fiscal year, but the House, *PRO*-2 reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for the program, earmarked only $3.1 billion *U*.
Despite the widening gap between the two sides, conferees eventually followed the pattern set * in previous years by *PRO*-1 opting *PRO*-2 to roughly split the difference.
That would hold spending on the program at about the previous year's level.
The decision *PRO* to keep the embattled F - 14's production line *PRO*-1 running for at least another year is an important victory for the House, and especially for Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis .).
As the head of the House conferees, Rep. Aspin has been under intense pressure *ICH*-1 from his colleagues *PRO* to reject Senate provisions that *T*-15 would have abruptly cut further F - 14 production.
The package "provides a temporary, golden parachute for Grumman," according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed - door bargaining.
But as part of the overall agreement, Grumman and its outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded *-1 from *PRO*-2 reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year's budget.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that the Navy's F - 14 is too expensive in an era of shrinking Pentagon budgets.
But the plane boasts a strong core of support in the House, where members are intent on *PRO*-2 saving Grumman jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier - based aircraft by the late 1990s *T*-1.
Conferees also agreed to Pentagon requests *PRO* to earmark a total of nearly $1 billion *U* for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, according to congressional aides.
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on a compromise that *T*-3 would give the Air Force nearly all of the $2.4 billion *U* 0 it wants *T*-5 for production of Northrop Corp.'s radar - eluding B - 2 bombers, which *T*-4 cost $530 million *U* apiece.
The final B - 2 agreement is certain *-1 to require detailed testing and verification of the bomber's capabilities, but congressional aides said 0 the accord won't include a House - passed provision that *T*-3 would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper, scaled - down version of the $70 billion *U* fleet of 132 B - 2s envisioned * by the Pentagon.
Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., said 0 its Lehn & Fink Products subsidiary was restructured *-1 *PRO* to form two operating groups, one for household products such as cleaners and disinfectants and the other for *PRO* do - it - yourself products such as wood finishes and stains.
The Montvale, N.J., unit said 0 the new operating structure "creates a more focused and responsive organization geared * to *PRO* effectively managing the size and scope of the unit's current business."
The consumer brands unit was absorbed *-1 by the photographic, pharmaceutical and chemical concern last year when it acquired Sterling Drug Inc *T*-2.
In a related matter, Peter Black, president of consumer brand Minwax, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 group vice president for the household products operating group.
Kenneth M. Evans, president of Thompson & Formby brand, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 group vice president of the *PRO* do - it - yourself operating group.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts *T*-1 in the past 30 days.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, seemed *-1 tethered again yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
*PRO*-2 Widely expected *-1 to open 10 to 15 cents a barrel higher on the strength of statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, the December contract managed *PRO*-2 to start the session only eight cents higher.
In the last hour of the trading day, December contract took a tumble *PRO*-1 to end the session 10 cents lower at $19.62 *U* a barrel.
And now that the price has fallen below $19.65 *U*, which many had said 0 *T*-1 showed considerable resistance, some traders and analysts figure 0 there's little 0 *T*-2 to stop the price from *PRO*-3 going lower on technical decisions.
With no petroleum - related news or changes in the fundamentals 0 *T*-1 to dictate price moves, "technicians are wanting *PRO*-2 to sell this stuff," said *T*-3 Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.
"And short - term, the technicians may have their way."
The market quickly discounted the weekly inventory report showing a 6.3 million barrel decrease in U.S. crude oil stocks as the legacy of Hurricane Jerry.
That storm hit the Gulf Coast Oct. 13, *PRO*-1 closing the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port for a time and preventing tankers from *PRO*-2 unloading.
Next week's report could very well show an increase in crude inventories.
*PRO* Dismissing the trade group's numbers left traders plenty of time 0 *PRO* to worry anew about the latest reports on OPEC production *T*-1.
An AP - Dow Jones survey of integrated oil companies, independent refiners, and oil industry consultants indicates that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production to 22.2 million barrels a day in September.
Estimates suggest 0 October's figure may be even higher.
That level of production isn't of much concern as long as demand continues strong, analysts said 0 *T*-1.
But the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and OPEC production doesn't seem *-1 to be slackening in anticipation of that.
Also, *PRO* maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies.
*PRO* To top off the bearish factors affecting yesterday's trading, late October weather, especially in the Northeast U.S., continues *-1 to be very moderate, *PRO* leaving heating oil futures trading *PRO*-2 lackluster.
"We aren't seeing any cold weather here," Mr. Bolling said *T*-1 from New York.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:
Soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying *PRO* to profit from technical price trends, as well as continued export strength.
A leveling off of farmer selling tied * to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices.
Wheat futures prices fell, however, at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million bushels of wheat by commodity speculator Richard Dennis.
Neither Mr. Dennis nor officials of his Chicago trading company, C&D Commodities, could be reached *-1 for comment.
As for corn and soybean futures, "a lot of commission house buying this morning and computer - driven buying" supported prices in early trading, said 0 *T*-1 Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
Soybean futures for November delivery gained 5.25 cents a bushel *PRO*-1 to close at $5.66 *U* a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
December corn futures added 2.25 cents a bushel *PRO*-1 to close at $2.4225 *U* a bushel on the Board of Trade.
Announced and anticipated purchases from foreign countries are also supporting futures prices.
"Russian ships are arriving in the gulf and there isn't enough grain in the pipeline," said *T*-1 Katharina Zimmer, a futures analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York.
The Soviet Union has purchased roughly eight million tons of grain this month, and is expected *-1 to take delivery by year end, analysts said 0 *T*-2.
COTTON:
Futures prices rose modestly, but trading volume wasn't very heavy.
The December contract settled at 73.97 cents a pound, up 0.59 cent, but it rose as high as 74.20 cents.
Several cotton analysts said that the move appeared *-1 to be mostly technical.
Traders who *T*-1 had sold contracts earlier, in hopes of *PRO*-3 buying them back at lower prices, yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices *PRO*-2 to limit their losses.
Floor traders also said that the market could have been helped *-2 by rumors, which *T*-1 have been circulating for the past two days, about China purchasing cotton.
The rumor, which *T*-1 has been neither confirmed nor denied *-2, has China buying 125,000 to 200,000 bales for near - term delivery.
One floor trader said that if there were Chinese purchases, they should have had a bigger effect on the market.
Another said that if China was a buyer, it would be the earliest 0 that country had made purchases *T*-1 since the 1979 - 80 crop year, and thus would be a bullish sign.
This trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the fundamentalists, who *T*-1 see higher prices ahead, and the technicians, who *T*-2 are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range, around 71 cents, and selling it when the price climbs more than 74 cents *T*-3.
This trader said that he thought 0 the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the December contract was able *PRO*-1 to exceed 75.75 cents.
He also noted that stocks on Aug. 1, 1990, are currently projected at 3.3 million bales, the smallest end - of - season supply since 1985.
COCOA:
The modest sell - off, which *T*-1 started on Tuesday, continued.
The December contract ended at $999 *U* a metric ton, down $15 *U*.
The market is drifting, at least partly, because of a lack of crop information out of Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the two largest African producers.
Harry Schwartz, a soft commodity specialist for Cargill Investors Services in New York, said 0 the only report 0 Ghana has issued *T*-1 about the arrival of cocoa from the interior was for 7,839 metric tons as of Oct. 12.
By this time last year, he noted 0 *?*, arrivals totaling 33,270 tons had been announced *-1.
A similar situation apparently exists in the Ivory Coast with no figures released *-1 yet this year, compared with 55,000 tons as of this time a year ago.
He said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports, shipping delays could result.
This is the worry that *T*-1 probably brought steadiness to the market earlier in the week, he said 0 *T*-2.
There was also some fear that without Ivory Coast cocoa a large French cocoa merchant, Cie . Financiere Sucre et Denrees, might not be able *PRO*-2 to deliver cocoa against the contracts 0 it had sold *T*-1 earlier for December delivery in London.
However, the French merchant has about 200,000 tons of old crop Ivory Coast cocoa stored * in the Netherlands from an agreement 0 it had negotiated *T*-1 with the Ivory Coast last spring.
Cargill thinks that even though the merchant has a contract stating that it won't bring this cocoa to market until after March 1991, there is some evidence 0 the contract has been modified *-1.
This modification, apparently, would permit the French merchant *PRO*-1 to deliver this cocoa, if necessary, against existing short positions.
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.'s Jacobs International unit was selected *-1 *PRO*-2 to design and build a microcomputer - systems manufacturing plant in County Kildare, Ireland, for Intel Corp.
Jacobs is an international engineering and construction concern.
Total capital investment at the site could be as much as $400 million *U*, according to Intel.
The 150,000 - square - foot plant will be constructed *-1 on a 55 - acre site near Dublin.
Jacobs Engineering officials couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
Levi Strauss Associates Inc., the closely held owner of Levi Strauss & Co., said 0 its fiscal third - quarter earnings jumped to $128.6 million *U* from $31.3 million *U* a year earlier, *PRO*-1 aided *-2 by a $69.8 million *U* gain from the sale of stock in a Japanese subsidiary.
The apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended * Aug. 27 of $1 billion *U*, up 12% from $908.8 million *U* a year ago.
The company said 0 its quarterly results are now being publicly filed *-1 as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans.
Christopher Cox's Oct. 13 editorial - page article "Toward More Crippling Lawsuits ..." misses the point.
The 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act is about *PRO* eliminating discriminatory barriers.
When we look closely at our own history *T*-2, it *EXP*-1 is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments.
This is how American women won the right *PRO* to vote *T*-1.
And it is how African - Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed *-1 their equal rights as citizens in this nation *T*-2.
For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities, the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece.
Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed *-2 in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed *-1 as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector.
Those who *T*-1 fear a plethora of suits paralyzing our legal system need *PRO*-2 only look at the record on the Rehabilitation Act.
Without legal recourse, there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone.

Delmed Inc.'s top two officers resigned and were succeeded *-2 by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, a major Delmed holder that *T*-1 has been negotiating *PRO*-3 to acquire a controlling stake.
In addition, Delmed, which *T*-2 makes and sells a dialysis solution used * in *PRO* treating kidney diseases, said 0 negotiations about pricing *ICH*-1 had collapsed between it and a major distributor, National Medical Care Inc.

In trading on the American Stock Exchange, Delmed closed at 50 cents, down 6.25 cents.
Fresenius owns about 42% of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
The two companies have been discussing a transaction under which Fresenius would buy Delmed stock for cash *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to bring its beneficial ownership to between 70% and 80% *U* of Delmed's fully diluted common stock.
The transaction also would combine Fresenius USA and Delmed.
Under the proposal, Delmed would issue about 123.5 million additional Delmed common shares to Fresenius at an average price of about 65 cents a share, though under no circumstances more than 75 cents a share.
Yesterday, Delmed said 0 it "continues *-1 to explore the possibility of a combination with Fresenius USA."
It added that it *EXP*-2 is apparent that any terms of a combination "would be substantially less favorable than those previously announced *."
While the discussions between Delmed and National Medical Care have been discontinued *-1, Delmed will continue *-2 to supply dialysis products through National Medical after their exclusive agreement ends in March 1990, Delmed said 0 *T*-3.
In addition, Delmed is exploring distribution arrangements with Fresenius USA, Delmed said 0 *T*-1.

Kemper Financial Services Inc., *PRO*-1 charging that program trading is ruining the stock market, cut off four big Wall Street firms from *PRO*-2 doing any of its stock - trading business.
The move is the biggest salvo yet in the renewed outcry against program trading, with Kemper putting its money--the millions of dollars in commissions 0 it generates *T*-1 each year--where its mouth is *T*-2.
The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices, such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16, and has increased chances for market crashes.
Over the past nine months, several firms, including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit, have attacked program trading as a major market evil.
Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the 1987 crash.
But most of them, *PRO*-1 led *-2 by Morgan Stanley & Co., moved back in earlier this year.
The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage--the rapid - fire, computer - guided buying and selling of stocks offset * with opposite trades in stock - index futures and options.
The object is *PRO* to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves.
Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Last month, program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day, or a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily volume.
On Tuesday afternoon, Kemper told Bear, Stearns & Co., General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage, officials inside and outside these firms confirmed 0 *T*-1.
Kemper officials declined *PRO*-2 to identify the firms but acknowledged a long - simmering dispute with four securities firms and said 0 the list of brokers 0 it won't do business with *T*-3 may be lengthened *-1 in the months ahead.
"We've been opposed to" index arbitrage "for a long time," said *T*-2 Stephen B. Timbers, chief investment officer at Kemper, which *T*-1 manages $56 billion *U*, including $8 billion *U* of stocks.
"Index arbitrage doesn't work, and it scares natural buyers" of stock.
While Mr. Timbers explained 0 he's "not totally convinced 0 index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market," he said that "on an intraday basis, it has major effects.
We've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them *PRO*-1 to cool it because they're ruining the market.
They said, ` Too bad,' so we finally said 0 we're not going *-1 to do business with them."
Kemper also blasted the Big Board for *PRO*-1 ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders.
"The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests" in its big member securities firms "that *T*-1 cloud its objectivity," Mr. Timbers said *T*-2.
"It has never been interested in what we think *T*-1.
The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors," he added *T*-1.
Small investors perceive that "big operators" dominate the market, said 0 *T*-1 Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National Association of Investors and head of the exchange's Individual Investors Advisory Committee set up after the 1987 crash.
"The impression 0 I've got *T*-1 is 0 they'd love *PRO*-2 to do away with it {program trading}, but they {the exchange} can't do it," he said *T*-3.
Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said in a recent interview that he has no inclination *PRO* to eliminate program trading.
He said 0 the market's volatility disturbs him, but that all 0 the exchange can do *T*-1 is "slow down the process" by *PRO*-2 using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers.
Mr. Timbers countered that "the mere fact 0 they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems."
Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies.
"We continue *-2 to believe 0 the position 0 we've taken *T*-1 is reasonable," a Morgan Stanley official said *T*-3.
"We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress *T*-1, and we have *?* recently," he said *T*-2, *PRO*-3 citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week.
Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody, said in a recent interview, "We don't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole."
According to Lawrence Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc., "Kemper is the first firm 0 *T*-1 to make a major statement with program trading."
He added that "*PRO* having just one firm do this isn't going *-1 to mean a hill of beans.
But if this prompts others *PRO*-1 to consider the same thing, then it may become much more important.
*PRO* Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are 0 the clerk who *T*-1 answers won't be the only one on the line.
Bosses have big ears these days.
Or *PRO* open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets.
Some would make even James Bond green with envy.
Eavesdropping--both corporate and private--is on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies.
And while sellers of the equipment and companies "monitoring" employees have few qualms, right - to - privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed.
"New technologies are changing the way 0 we deal with each other *T*-1 and the way 0 we work *T*-2," says *T*-3 Janlori Goldman, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.
"Our expectation of confidentiality is being eroded *-1."
On the corporate side, companies claim that *PRO* monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary *PRO* to gauge productivity and ensure good service.
The practice is common at catalog, insurance and phone companies, banks and telemarketers, according to trade groups and worker organizations.
It's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline, car - rental, hotel and railroad industries.
The Communications Workers of America, which *T*-1 opposes such monitoring, says 0 supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year.
Among companies saying 0 they monitor employees are *T*-1 United Airlines, American Airlines, United Parcel Service, Nynex Corp., Spiegel Inc., and the circulation department of this newspaper.
Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes.
Dictaphone Corp. says 0 there's a big business demand for its voice - activated taping systems, whether the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system, which *T*-1 costs from $10,000 to $120,000 *U* and can record 240 conversations simultaneously, or simple handheld units selling for $395 *U*.
Businesses "want *PRO*-1 to verify information and ensure accuracy," says 0 *T*-2 John Hiltunen, Dictaphone's manager of media relations.
The state of Alaska recently bought the Veritrac system, he says 0 *?*, "*PRO*-1 to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort."
Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. say 0 they use voice - activated systems *PRO*-1 to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders.
Shearson says 0 it has taped some of its institutional trading desks, such as commodities and futures, for about four years.
Both companies stress that employees know 0 they are being recorded *-1 and that customer conversations aren't taped *-2.
Kidder Peabody & Co. says 0 it monitors bond - trading conversations between brokers and customers *PRO*-1 to safeguard order accuracy.
Eavesdropping by individuals is harder 0 *PRO* to measure *T*-1.
But devices are there for the asking, whether in stores or through the mail.
The Counter Spy Shop in Washington, D.C., for instance, offers the "Secret Connection" attache case, which *T*-1 can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch.
That and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands, but simple voice - activated tape recorders sell for as little as $70 *U* at electronics stores like Radio Shack.
The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases, say 0 *T*-1 private investigators.
While tape recordings 0 *T*-1 to uncover, say, infidelity aren't admissible in court, they can mean leverage in a settlement.
*PRO*-1 Concerned with the increased availability of surveillance technology and heavier use of it, lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue.
Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made *-1 aware of monitoring.
And four states--California, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania--have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded *-1 *T*-2.
Two bills in Congress hope *PRO*-1 to make such restrictions national.
In May, Rep. Don Edwards (D. Calif .) introduced congressional legislation that *T*-2 would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring, warning people that they are being heard *-1.
(The legislation is similar to a 1987 "beeper bill" that *T*-2 was defeated *-1 after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry.)
Also last spring, Rep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.), introduced a bill requiring universal two - party consent to any tapings in cases that *T*-1 don't involve law enforcement.
In addition, products such as voice - activated tape recorders would have *-1 to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping.
The outlook on both federal bills is uncertain, *PRO* especially remembering the 1987 defeat.
The ACLU and worker organizations back tighter laws, but employers and device manufacturers object.
"I'm sympathetic with workers who *T*-1 feel under the gun," says *T*-3 Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association of America, which *T*-2 is lobbying strenuously against the Edwards beeper bill.
"But the only way 0 you can find out how your people are doing *T*-2 *T*-1 is by *PRO* listening."
The powerful group, which *T*-1 represents many of the nation's telemarketers, was instrumental in *PRO* derailing the 1987 bill.
Spiegel also opposes the beeper bill, *PRO*-2 saying 0 the noise 0 it requires *T*-1 would interfere with customer orders, *PRO* causing irritation and even errors.
Laura Dale, center manager at the catalog company's customer order center in Reno, Nev., defends monitoring.
"We like *PRO*-2 to follow up and make sure 0 operators are achieving our standards of company service," says *T*-3 Ms. Dale, who *T*-1 supervises 350 operators.
John Bonomo, a Nynex spokesman, says 0 the telephone company needs *-1 to monitor operators *PRO*-1 to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job.
"Sometimes," he says *?*, "we'll pull someone off the phones for more training."
Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right *ICH*-1 of employers *PRO* to monitor employees' for evaluation purposes.
And in the past, Congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations.
But opponents, *PRO*-2 led * by the CWA, say 0 new laws are needed *-1 because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81% of monitored workers aren't represented *-3 by unions.
The CWA claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy, but increases stress.
"Nine to Five," a Cleveland - based office workers organization that *T*-1 supports the beeper bill, six months ago started a privacy hot line 0 *T*-2 to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses.
Meanwhile, supporters of the Dellums two - party consent bill say 0 it is needed *-1 because of a giant loophole in the one - party consent law.
Currently, if the person taping is a party to the conversation, it *EXP*-1's all right *PRO* to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line.
(*PRO* Intercepting other people's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $10,000 *U*.)
The electronics industry is closely following the Dellums bill.
Some marketers of surveillance gear--including Communication Control System Ltd., which *T*-2 owns the Counter Spy Shop and others like it--already put warning labels *ICH*-1 in their catalogs informing customers of the one - party law.
But vendors contend that they can't control how their products are used *-2 *T*-1.
Radio Shack says 0 it has a policy against *PRO* selling products if a salesperson suspects 0 they will be used *-1 illegally.
"Everything sold at Radio Shack has a legal purpose," says *T*-1 Bernard Appel, president of the Tandy Corp. subsidiary.
He says 0 he hasn't yet studied the Dellums bill, but that *PRO* requiring a beeping tone on recorders "would be ludicrous."
Still, Radio Shack is aware that some of its products are controversial.
A few years ago, the company voluntarily stopped selling "The Big Ear," a powerful microphone.
With its ability *PRO* to pick up rustlings and flapping wings, "it was meant *-1 to be a toy for children for bird watching," says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Appel.
"But we were getting too many complaints that people were using them *PRO*-1 to eavesdrop on their neighbors."
Sun Microsystems Inc. said 0 Prime Computer Inc. has agreed *PRO*-1 to resell as much as $200 million *U* worth of Sun's machines over the next two years.
The computers use the company's own microprocessor called * *PRO*-2 Sparc, Sun said 0 *T*-1.
Cie . Generale des Eaux reported that net profit climbed 30% in the first half of 1989 and said that it expects a gain of about 25% for the full year.
The French water treatment group said 0 consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests rose to 749 million francs (US$119.2 million *U*) from 575 million francs in the first half of 1988.
Revenue climbed 13% to 45.4 billion francs from 40.1 billion.
Generale des Eaux said 0 the earnings gain was led *-1 by its water, energy and building activities.
Beghin - Say S.A. said that it plans *PRO*-1 to sell its remaining paper operations by the end of January as part of a drive *PRO* to refocus on the food sector and lower its debt.
The French unit of Ferruzzi Agricola Finanziaria also disclosed a 40% rise in its consolidated net profit for the first half of 1989, excluding nonrecurring items and after payments to minority interests.
Beghin - Say said 0 the sale will be done *-1 in two parts and will raise a total of 2.025 billion francs ($325 million *U*).
This will include the sale of its interest in the joint venture Beghin Corbehem to Feldemuehle AG.
The West German paper company entered the venture in April 1988 by *PRO*-1 acquiring a 50% stake, also from Beghin - Say.
The other part of the transaction will see Beghin - Say sell its 50% stake in its Kaysersberg paper affiliate to an unspecified unit of the petrochemical group Montedison S.p . A., which *T*-1 is also controlled *-2 by Ferruzzi.
And in a separate transaction, Beghin - Say will sell its remaining 25% interest in A.T.B., a holding company for international trading assets, to an unspecified unit of Ferruzzi for 258 million francs.
Coda Energy Inc. said 0 it completed the sale of Phenix - Transmission Co. to Bishop Pipeline Co., for $17 million *U* in cash and notes.
Coda, an oil and gas concern, said 0 it and its partners received $7 million *U* in cash and $10 million *U* in five - year notes for the Kansas intrastate pipeline.
Coda owned 60% of the pipeline and private entities owned the rest.
Bishop is based *-1 in Hutchinson, Kansas.
Adolph Coors Co. said 0 William K. Coors, chairman, assumed the additional responsibilities of president, *PRO*-1 succeeding Jeffrey H. Coors.
Jeffrey Coors, 44 years old, had been president since 1985, when he succeeded his father Joseph in the job *T*-1.
But the brewer said 0 Jeffrey Coors voluntarily gave up the position *PRO*-2 to focus more of his energy on Coors Technology Co., a small unit of Coors 0 he has run *T*-1 for several years.
A Coors spokesman said 0 the company doesn't believe 0 the move will further increase William Coors's influence or reduce the influence of Jeffrey Coors, Peter Coors or Joseph Coors Jr., who *T*-1 run the company's three operating units.
"It certainly wasn't intended *-1 to be a demotion," the spokesman said *T*-2.
"Pete and Jeff and Joe Jr. have taken over the reins and are doing most of the work.
We don't think 0 this will affect that."
Jeffrey, Peter and Joseph Jr. are brothers.
William Coors is their uncle.
Jeffrey, Peter, Joseph Jr., William and Joseph Sr. constitute the company's board.
Peter Coors runs the Coors Brewing Co. unit, the nation's fourth - largest brewery that *T*-1 accounted for $1.24 billion *U* of Adolph Coors's $1.52 billion *U* in 1988 sales.
Joseph Jr. runs Coors Ceramics Co., the other operating unit, which *T*-1 had about $150 million *U* in 1988 sales.
French chemicals group, Orkem S.A., said Wednesday 0 it has made a bid for control of Coates Brothers PLC, a British manufacturer of inks and polyester resins.
State - controlled Orkem already owns 40.6% of Coates.
The remainder is held *-1 by the public and by family interests, a spokeswoman for the French group said 0 *T*-2.
Orkem declined *PRO*-2 to give details of its offer, *PRO*-2 saying only that the bid will be submitted *-1 for approval by the board of the British company.
Law firms that *T*-1 have feasted and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines.
The disarray in the junk - bond market that *T*-1 began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. and the failure *ICH*-2 of banks *PRO* to deliver financing for a leveraged buy - out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. has reverberated through some of the nation's largest law firms.
While it is still too early *PRO* to tell whether the dearth of takeover activity is only temporary, many lawyers say 0 their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work, which *T*-1 has been so lucrative in the past.
Much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed *-1 by the hour.
If deals take longer *PRO* to complete *?* and there are fewer of them 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1, "you can't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish *T*-2," says 0 *T*-3 one lawyer at a large New York firm.
"We're planning on a rip - roaring year in 1989, but next year we'll be another story," said *T*-1 Robert Freedman, a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.
"We're settling down to a less active period."
Lawyers at such firms as Sullivan & Cromwell; Willkie Farr & Gallagher; Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson all say 0 they, too, have experienced a significant slowdown, particularly during the past few weeks.
"Everyone is waiting *PRO*-2 to see if deals can be done *-1 at sensible prices and if money is available," said *T*-3 Jack Nusbaum, co-chairman of Willkie Farr.
"It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical."
Some lawyers say 0 the slump, while *PRO*-2 more obvious in recent weeks, began earlier this year.
Dennis Block, a partner at the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said that in the first eight months of this year, 89 hostile offers were launched *-1, compared with 157 for the first eight months of
What *T*-1's more, he said 0 *?*, "transactions are taking a much longer time *PRO* to conclude *?* and many fall apart for lack of financing" and more stringent scrutiny by state courts.
Lawyers also say 0 an erratic stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely *PRO* to be proposed *-1.
Still, some lawyers say 0 the mergers slowdown hasn't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones.
"We just took another floor for our London offices," said *T*-1 Joseph Flom of the New York firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Davis Polk & Wardwell also said 0 its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners *PRO*-1 busy.
"European companies are looking *PRO*-1 to buy American ones," said *T*-2 Henry King, the managing partner at that firm.
"But the question is whether things 0 people are looking at *T*-1 will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions."
MURDER THREAT charged in Haas Securities Corp . stock - manipulation trial.
In the trial of former Haas Securities Chairman Eugene Laff, the defense accused one of the government's chief witnesses of *PRO*-1 threatening *PRO*-2 to kill Mr. Laff.
Mr. Laff's attorney, John Lang, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness, Henry Lorin, told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed *-1 *T*-2.
The conversation was taped *-1 by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang said *T*-2 was an effort *PRO* to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff.
In his opening arguments last week in federal court in New York, Mr. Lang told the jury that Mr. Lorin was the "real master criminal" behind the stock manipulation, and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it.
In March, Mr. Laff was indicted *-1 on 15 counts of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and *PRO* obstructing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The government has charged that Mr. Lorin and Mr. Laff were part of a conspiracy *PRO* to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices.
Mr. Lorin, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock - manipulation charges in April and agreed *PRO*-1 to cooperate with the government's investigation of Mr. Laff.
During his cross examination of Mr. Lorin, Mr. Lang read from the transcripts of a conversation that *T*-2 was taped *-1 Oct. 20, 1988.
Stanley Aslanian, the Haas broker who *T*-1 agreed *PRO*-2 to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation, also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy *PRO* to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed *PRO*-3 to cooperate.
According to the transcript, Mr. Lorin said 0 Mr. Laff should be killed *-1 after Mr. Aslanian told him that information given * to Mr. Laff by another conspirator could jeopardize the stock scheme.
Mr. Lorin then repeated the threat, and Mr. Aslanian urged him *PRO*-1 not to say such things.
From the parts of the transcript read * by Mr. Lang, it *EXP*-2 was unclear what exactly Mr. Lorin feared 0 *T*-1 might happen.
When *PRO*-1 asked *-3 for a copy of the transcript *T*-2, Mr. Lang said 0 Judge Thomas P. Griesa had instructed him *PRO*-4 not to release it or the memorandum.
During the trial, Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had been so upset "that you considered *PRO*-1 killing Mr. Laff? ...
Isn't it *EXP*-3 true that you were so worked up that *PRO* framing Mr. Laff for this crime was the least that you planned *T*-4 for him?"
Mr. Lorin responded, "No."
When Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had taken steps *PRO*-3 to have Mr. Laff killed *-2 *T*-1, the witness again said no.
Peter Lieb, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the trial.
TRUSTEE WHO *T*-1 MONITORED settlement payments to Dalkon Shield claimants quits.
Stephen A. Saltzburg, one of five trustees appointed *PRO* to monitor payments to women injured * by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine contraceptive, resigned, *PRO*-1 citing personal reasons.
Mr. Saltzburg, who *T*-1 teaches evidence at the University of Virginia School of Law and was a deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Justice Department until August, submitted his resignation earlier this month to federal Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr., in Richmond, Va.
Judge Merhige is overseeing the bankruptcy - law reorganization of A.H. Robins Co., the company that *T*-1 manufactured the shield.
In a letter Monday to Mr. Saltzburg, the judge said 0 he would "reluctantly" accept the resignation.
The $2.38 billion *U* Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust was established *-1 as part of A.H. Robins' bankruptcy - reorganization plan *PRO* to resolve injury claims arising from use of the shield.
American Home Products Corp. proposes *PRO*-1 to acquire the company.
The remaining four trustees on the Claimants Trust have 60 days 0 *PRO* to nominate a successor to Mr. Saltzburg *T*-1.
Judge Merhige will make the appointment.
CHICAGO LAW FIRM recruits American Express Co. vice president:
Coffield Ungaretti Harris & Slavin brought in Howard A. Menell as a partner in its Washington, D.C., office, which *T*-1 opened Oct. 1.
For the past six years, Mr. Menell, 43 years old, served as vice president for government affairs at American Express.
He previously was staff director and counsel for the Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs.
The other lawyer in the office is partner Robert A. Macari, the firm's legislative director.
THE PHILADELPHIA law firm of Ballard, Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll said 0 three partners have joined its business and finance department.
John Ake, 48, a former vice-president in charge of legal compliance at American Capital Management & Research Inc., in Houston, will join Ballard Spahr's corporate - securities practice.
Kent Walker, 45, a former partner at the Philadelphia law firm of Mesirov, Gelman, Jaffe, Cramer & Jamieson, will specialize in antitrust, real estate and mergers and acquisitions.
Richard L. Sherman, 42, will advise midsized businesses.
Mr. Sherman is former deputy general counsel for SmithKline Beckman Corp., in Philadelphia, now SmithKline Beecham PLC, in London.
The Democratic - controlled House, by a margin of 51 votes, failed *-2 to override President Bush's veto of legislation renewing federal support of Medicaid abortions for poor women who *T*-1 are victims of rape and incest.
The 231 - 191 roll call illustrates the limits of power 0 a resurgent abortion - rights movement still faces *T*-192.
It continues *-1 to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two - thirds majority required * *PRO* to prevail over Mr. Bush.
Democrats voted *PRO*-1 to override by a 3 - 1 margin, but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president, who *T*-2 has threatened *PRO*-3 to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills.
Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion *U* measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.
*PRO*-1 To gain more leverage, abortion - rights advocates may seek *PRO*-1 to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month.
But the stark numbers yesterday--when 282 votes were needed *-1 *T*-2--indicate 0 the president is in a commanding position for at least this year.
"Unless he changes, they lose," said *T*-1 a Democratic leadership aide.
The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill 0 *PRO* to keep the government *PRO*-3 operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion *U* in emergency funds 0 *PRO* to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake *T*-2 *T*-1.
By a lopsided 97 - 1 margin, the Senate approved the measure after *PRO*-1 attaching further provisions sought * by the influential California delegation and, despite reservations, the House adopted the bill on a 303 - 107 roll call.
The package is more than $1 billion *U* above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week.
But given the political importance of California, the administration was content *PRO*-1 to use its influence *PRO*-2 to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.
The $2.85 billion *U* measure comes on top of $1.1 billion *U* appropriated * after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low - interest disaster loans.
The bill last night includes $500 million *U* 0 *PRO* to help *PRO* finance this credit *T*-2 and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $1.8 billion *U* *PRO* to accommodate the expected loan activity.
In direct cash assistance, $1 billion *U* *ICH*-1 is provided *-2 in federal highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion *U* is divided *-3 between general emergency aid and a reserve 0 *T*-4 to be available to the president *PRO*-5 to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position *PRO*-1 to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted *?* in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.
The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted *-1 against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that *T*-2 otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid *PRO* to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge damaged * in last week's earthquake.
The underlying stopgap bill is the second required * by Congress this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted * into law.
The standoff over abortion is certain *-1 to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed * by Mr. Bush, bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign - aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family - planning issues.
The vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years, and though the Democratic leadership is ambivalent about how *PRO* to address the abortion issue *T*-1, the debate is increasingly measured in party terms.
The 189 Democrats who *T*-1 supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who *T*-2 initially backed the rape - and - incest exemption two weeks ago *NOT* and 136 last year on a similar vote.
By comparison, Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement.
Only 42 GOP members *ICH*-2 opposed the president's veto, a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who *T*-1 supported the rape - and - incest exemption last year.
At a recent White House meeting, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), the ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, argued with his friend Mr. Bush against a veto, and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday, they are plainly uncomfortable with his position.
"This isn't a political issue, this is a moral issue," said *T*-1 Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), the most eloquent spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.
But after years of *PRO* using the issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.
New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning *PRO*-2 to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent, GOP Rep. James Courter, who *T*-1 has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent.
In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church - state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif .) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics--including Mr. Florio--for *PRO*-1 having the "chutzpah" 0 *PRO* to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion *T*-2.
Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion - rights movement.
"This may not make George Bush a one - term president," said *T*-1 the Oregon liberal, *PRO*-2 addressing the Republican side of the House.
"But if you support him over rape victims, this may be your last term."
Separately, the House last night approved a nearly $67 billion *U* compromise spending bill providing the first construction funds for the administration's ambitious space station in fiscal 1990 and incorporating far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market.
The current ceiling on home loans insured * by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased *-1 to $124,875 *U*, and the bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development new authority *PRO* to facilitate the refinancing of subsidized loans for low - income homeowners.
By a 325 - 92 margin, the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back an early challenge by House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) to the FHA provision.
And on a closer 250 - 170 roll call, lawmakers upheld controversial agreements made * by a House - Senate conference earmarking community development funds for more than 40 projects backed * by often influential members.
Amoco Corp. said 0 it plans *PRO*-2 to install two platforms and drill as many as 22 wells *PRO*-3 to develop oil reserves 0 it discovered *T*-1 in the Atlantic Ocean about 25 miles off the coast of Congo.
Amoco, an energy concern, is the operator of the project with a 43.75% working interest, and other partners include Hydro Congo, the Congolese state oil company, with a 50% interest, and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co. with a 6.25% stake.
Production is expected *-1 to be about 40,000 barrels of oil a day after completion of the drilling program.
Concord Camera Corp. completed the acquisition of Peter Bauser G.m.b . H., a West German photographic products distributor.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Concord is a camera and photographic products company.
Rupert Murdoch acquired a 25% stake in Grupo Zeta S.A., the leading Spanish magazine and newspaper publisher said 0 *T*-1.
The transaction called for Mr. Murdoch's News International PLC, a unit of Australia - based News Corp., to subscribe to a rights issue by Zeta valued * at 6.65 billion pesetas ($57 million *U*).
Also participating in the issue was *T*-1 Servifilm Spain Cinematografica S.A.
The film producer, owned * by Madrid - based financier Jacques Hachuel, received a 5% stake in the Barcelona - based publishing group.
The cash injection boosted Zeta's capital more than four-fold, to 8.47 billion pesetas from 1.82 billion pesetas, *PRO* greatly enhancing the group's ability *PRO* to make investments, Zeta officials said 0 *T*-1.
Following its failure *ICH*-1 last month *PRO* to win a license for one of Spain's first three private television stations, Zeta is seeking investment opportunities in communications and publishing.
With annual sales of about 30 billion pesetas, Zeta publishes over a dozen magazines, including the popular Tiempo, Interviu and Panorama, and three regional dailies.
Chairman Antonio Asensio will retain a 70% share in Zeta.
Quickview Systems Inc. said 0 it filed a lawsuit against Apple Computer Inc., *PRO*-1 claiming patent infringement in an element of Apple's popular HyperCard software program.
The suit, filed * in Minneapolis federal court, claims that Apple violated a Quickview patent that *T*-1 allows computer users to display "only portions of multiple fields on a computer screen with the ability *PRO* to see the entire contents of any given field."
The HyperCard program allows users to design applications for Macintosh computers without *PRO* having *-1 to be hardcore programmers and is distributed *-2 with every Macintosh sold *.
It's one of the most popular computer programs of all time, but analysts said 0 the Quickview suit doesn't appear *-1 to bode major difficulties for Apple.
The technology at issue "is not an underlying technology of HyperCard to my knowledge," said 0 *T*-1 Danny Goodman, a San Francisco - area HyperCard program developer.
Nonetheless, the suit seeks unspecified damages that an attorney for Quickview claimed 0 *T*-1 could run into the millions of dollars.
In Cupertino, Calif., Apple said that it believes 0 the case has no merit, and that HyperCard does not infringe "any valid claims" of the Quickview patents.
It said 0 it filed an action of its own in federal court in San Jose, Calif., *PRO*-1 seeking a declaration that Quickview's claims are invalid.
A major Tokyo newspaper reported that a Japanese department store concern is planning *PRO*-1 to offer about $1.3 billion *U* *PRO*-2 to buy Bloomingdale's.
Campeau Corp., the chain's owner, declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the report.
A spokeswoman said 0 Toronto - based Campeau has received "expressions of interest" in Bloomingdale's, but she declined *PRO*-2 to comment on whether any actual bids had been made *-1.
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, reported Wednesday that Tokyu Department Store Co. is planning *PRO*-2 to team up with U.S. and Western European financing *PRO*-3 to buy the New York - based retail chain, which Campeau has put up *T*-1 for sale.
The service didn't identify its Tokyu sources.
"This is the first of many rumors 0 we expect *PRO*-3 to hear *T*-1 during the sale's process," said *T*-2 a Bloomingdale's spokesman.
"We won't comment on them."
Tokyu executives weren't available for comment early Thursday morning in Tokyo.
Campeau's chairman, Robert Campeau, said at its annual meeting in July that he valued Bloomingdale's at $2 billion *U*.
Among previously disclosed possible bidders is *T*-2 Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub, who *T*-1 has aligned himself with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Blackstone Group.
Investment bankers in Tokyo confirmed that Tokyu Department Store is one of several Japanese companies that *T*-2 has been approached *-1 by representatives of a management committee headed * by Bloomingdale's Mr. Traub.
But they said 0 detailed financial figures haven't been passed *-1 yet to any prospective buyers.
"Nobody is going *-1 to make a real bid before the middle of November," said *T*-2 one investment banker familiar with the discussions in Japan.
"Tokyu is one of the potential buyers who *T*-1 might raise its hand.
But it's in very early stages still."
Bloomingdale's is a 17 - store chain acquired * last year by Campeau in its $6.6 billion *U* acquisition of Federated.
Bloomingdale's does an estimated $1.2 billion *U* in annual sales.
The sale of Bloomingdale's is a condition of efforts *ICH*-2 by Toronto - based Olympia & York Developments Ltd. *PRO* to arrange $800 million *U* in bridge financing for Campeau, which *T*-1 disclosed last month that its retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., were strapped for cash.
O&Y, owned * by Toronto's Reichmann family, is also supervising major restructuring and refinancing of Campeau, a Toronto - based real estate and retailing company.
One executive familiar with the Bloomingdale's situation said, "No book *ICH*-3 has been issued *-1 regarding Bloomingdale's, there are no projections, so I doubt very much whether any bid has been made *-2."
Separately, a Campeau shareholder filed suit, *PRO*-1 charging Campeau, Chairman Robert Campeau and other officers with *PRO*-2 violating securities law.
The suit, filed * in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks class - action status.
The suit accuses the retailer and several of its officers of *PRO*-1 making false and misleading statements about the company's business affairs.
The suit says 0 the company failed *-1 to disclose material adverse information about its financial condition.
A spokesman for the company said 0 Campeau hasn't seen the suit and declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Businessland Inc. said 0 it purchased a major regional computer retailer, Data Systems Computer Centre Inc., Springfield, New Jersey.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The purchase strengthens San Jose, Calif. - based Businessland's links to the large corporations who *T*-1 are among the biggest buyers of computers.
Data Systems has five retail stores in the northeast, but specializes in *PRO* selling personal computers made * by International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to banks, brokerage firms and other big businesses based * in the New York metropolitan area.
John Fitzsimmons, chief executive officer of Data Systems, said 0 the company was profitable and expected sales of nearly $100 million *U* this year.
He said 0 Businessland, which *T*-1 operates stores in 50 U.S. metropolitan areas, planned *PRO*-2 to absorb his firm's operations.
Robert L. Wood, 37 - year - old chief financial officer, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chairman and chief executive officer of this independent power producer, *PRO*-1 succeeding Raymond L. Hixson, 63.
Mr. Hixson, who *T*-1 resigned effective Jan. 1 for health reasons, remains a director.
International Technology Corp. and Davy McKee Corp., a unit of London's Davy Corp., said 0 they were awarded *-1 a $55 million *U* contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the closure of the Helen Kramer Landfill Superfund site in Mantua Township, N.J.
International Technology, an environmental management concern, said 0 the contract includes construction of slurry walls, gas collection systems, a multilayer cap and water treatment plant.
Philip L. Hall, president of J. Lawrence Hall Co., Nashua, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this thrift holding company, *PRO*-1 filling a vacancy.
The New York Stock Exchange is expected *-1 to launch its own program trading vehicle today, just as controversy over this trading strategy heats up.
The Big Board this morning plans *PRO*-1 to begin *-2 trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio "basket" product, the first program - trading vehicle carrying the exchange's seal of approval.
ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index in a single trade of a minimum of $5 million *U*.
"Customized" baskets of fewer stocks will also be available.
The Securities and Exchange Commission gave provisional six - month approval to the Big Board basket at a meeting late yesterday.
The SEC at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, where the minimum will be $1.7 million *U* *T*-1.
Also approved was *T*-1 a plan *PRO* to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the Midwest Stock Exchange.
The basket products are "an evolutionary step" in *PRO* solving problems in *PRO* trading big blocks of stock that *T*-1 came to light in the 1987 market crash, said 0 *T*-2 SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest.
New SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, *PRO*-1 overseeing his first public meeting, said 0 there have been concerns that the Big Board's basket could attract investors with a "short - term perspective" who *T*-2 would rapidly turn over the product, thus *PRO*-3 increasing volatility.
But Richard Ketchum, the SEC's market regulation chief, said 0 he didn't believe 0 "this will spawn dramatic new program - trading strategies that *T*-1 will be destabilizing."
The baskets on the Big Board and CBOE--which *T*-1 involve the actual S&P stocks, unlike the stock - index contracts currently traded on the Chicago futures markets, and index options on the CBOE--will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market's wild price swings.
The Big Board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by *PRO*-1 possibly drawing business from more - volatile forms of program trading.
ESPs are also an attempt *ICH*-1 by the Big Board *PRO* to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as London.
Big Board officials also hope 0 Japanese investors will become interested in the exchange's product.
Already, many of the Big Board's own floor traders are warning that the ESP baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public.
The 400 - member Alliance of Floor Brokers said 0 the new product, with the $5 million *U* minimum, will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to "wild spasms of volatility."
Stockbrokers who *T*-1 cater to individual investors said 0 the Big Board's new product confirms 0 the exchange doesn't want *PRO*-2 to curtail program trading, which *T*-3 last month accounted for a record 13.8% of the exchange's average daily volume.
"The New York Stock Exchange is losing its cool here," said *T*-1 James Andrews, head of institutional trading at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
The new stock baskets "are going *-3 to make it *EXP*-1 easier for program trading to be done *-2.
And it's going *-2 to be done *-1 more frequently as the result of *PRO* having more access to it at different places."
Both the Big Board's Exchange Stock Portfolio and the Chicago exchange's Market Basket are designed *-1 for institutional investors.
The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans, mutual fund managers and index - arbitrage traders.
In index arbitrage, program traders buy and sell stocks and stock - index futures *PRO*-1 to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets.
At the same time, only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board *PRO*-1 to buy and sell ESPs as market makers, an unenthusiastic response.
The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp. unit, Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. unit.
Kidder, Peabody & Co., a General Electric Co. unit that *T*-1 has become the biggest program trader along with Morgan Stanley, isn't a market maker, although the Big Board hopes 0 that will change.
Similarly, the Big Board hopes *PRO*-1 to entice Merrill Lynch & Co.
Neither has plans *PRO* to be a market maker for now.
Traders said 0 major securities firms are reluctant *PRO*-1 to become market makers because they fear 0 the baskets may attract only limited trading.
Big Board officials say 0 only 25 contracts a day *ICH*-1 may trade at first, equivalent to a day's action at a small, regional exchange.
Even though the Big Board says 0 its product represents a post-crash "reform," some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month's Friday the 13th market plunge, the Dow Jones Industrial Average might have dropped more than the 190 points 0 it did *T*-1.
With the futures locked * into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult, program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system, the traders say 0 *T*-1.
"If we had the baskets, we would be leaving in caskets," one trader said *T*-1.
The SEC's Mr. Breeden said 0 the after - hours trading on the Midwest exchange would *PRO*-3 help the U.S. *PRO*-4 win back business that *T*-1 has moved overseas *PRO*-2 to conduct after - hours trades.
International Business Machines Corp. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to let Motorola Inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort *PRO* to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry.
IBM, which *T*-2 made the announcement at the dedication of a research center here, said 0 it invited many other companies *ICH*-3 *PRO*-1 to participate as well, including some from Europe.
Jack Kuehler, IBM's president, said 0 IBM is also considering *PRO*-1 letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined *PRO*-2 to be more specific.
IBM, which *T*-1 said a year ago 0 it was inviting companies *PRO*-3 to participate in some semiconductor work, has become far more open about its technology as it has tried *PRO*-4 to rally U.S. industry *PRO*-5 to head off the Japanese, who *T*-2 now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips.
While IBM, Armonk, N.Y., makes the bulk of the DRAMs 0 it uses *T*-1, it doesn't make the equipment needed * *PRO* to produce those chips.
And IBM worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market, too, unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips *ICH*-2 here 0 *T*-1 to keep U.S. equipment makers *PRO*-3 healthy.
Failure of U.S. equipment makers, IBM fears 0 *?*, would leave it *PRO*-3 dependent on many of the Japanese companies that *T*-1 compete with it in other parts of the market.
IBM also said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to benefit from the expertise that Motorola and other companies can bring *T*-1 *PRO* to bear on the difficult problems involved * in semiconductor manufacturing.
IBM already participates in one industrywide effort *PRO* to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques.
IBM said 0 it expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive.
A state - of - the - art plant cost $40 million *U* in the mid-1970s but costs $500 million *U* today because the technology is so complex.
And IBM said 0 it expects the costs to continue *-1 climbing.
IBM, which *T*-1 said 0 Motorola is paying just a nominal fee *PRO* to cover the 21 - month agreement, acknowledged 0 some companies had turned down its invitation *PRO* to join in.
But it said 0 that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s.
IBM said 0 it thought 0 more companies would become interested as the project progresses.
The project involving Motorola concerns a technique, called * *PRO*-3 X-ray lithography, that *T*-1 figures *PRO*-2 to be crucial to future generations of memory chips.
Currently, chips are produced *-1 by *PRO* shining light through a mask *PRO* to produce an image on the chip, much as a camera produces an image on film.
But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine, and the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light are long enough so that the images 0 they draw *T*-1 may be too blurry--much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble *PRO* painting a thin one.
X-rays, by contrast, travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light.
X-rays have problems, too.
They can make the masks brittle and can pass through material 0 they're not supposed *-1 to *?* *?* *T*-2.
But, *PRO* assuming 0 those problems can be overcome *-1, they should allow for memory chips that *T*-3 could approach one billion bits of information--250 times as much as *?* is contained *-2 in the four - megabit chips that *T*-4 are just reaching the market and a million times what *T*-5 was possible in the mid-1970s.
Ford Motor Co. said 0 it is consolidating control of its Asian operations under a new organization here that *T*-2 will be headed *-1 by W. Wayne Booker.
Ford Asia - Pacific will coordinate the activities of Ford subsidiaries in Japan, Australia, Taiwan and New Zealand and work with Ford business associates throughout the region.
These functions are currently performed out of Melbourne, Australia, and at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
Mr. Booker, executive director of Ford's Latin America Automotive Operations since December 1988, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 vice president of Ford Asia - Pacific.
The White House called on Congress *PRO*-1 to attach the proposed capital - gains tax cut to its final deficit - reduction bill, but lawmakers seem *-2 likely *PRO*-3 to balk at the idea.
Earlier this month, the White House endorsed *PRO* stripping the controversial tax measure from the bill so that Congress could pass quickly a "clean" bill containing only provisions specifically designed * *PRO* to meet federal budget targets under the Gramm - Rudman act.
But now that Congress has missed the legal deadline for *PRO* meeting the Gramm - Rudman targets, the White House said 0 it has returned to its original view that a capital - gains cut should be part of the deficit - reduction bill, on which Congress continues *-2 to work *T*-1.
"If that doesn't happen, then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote," said *T*-1 press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
On Capitol Hill, though, there doesn't seem *-1 to be sufficient sentiment *PRO* to pair capital gains and the deficit - reduction bill.
Texas Rep. William Archer, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said, "I don't see how we have the votes" *PRO* to place a capital - gains tax cut there *T*-1.
Meanwhile, President Bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital - gains tax cut.
The White House said 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to hold a series of private White House meetings, mostly with Senate Democrats, *PRO*-2 to try *PRO*-3 to persuade lawmakers *PRO*-4 to fall in line behind the tax cut.
The first meeting yesterday was with 10 Senate Democrats who *T*-1 have expressed an interest in *PRO* cutting the tax.
According to some who *T*-1 attended, the senators argued that the president should give the Democratic leaders in Congress a victory of their own *PRO*-2 to compensate them for *PRO* allowing the president to win on the controversial capital - gains issue.
Issues discussed * in this context were *T*-1 an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child - care spending.
The president was said *-1 to have been noncommittal.
This is in response to Atsushi Kageyama's Manager's Journal, "*PRO* Looking for the Real Thing in Sony" (editorial page, Oct. 2).
Though I agree with many of Mr. Kageyama's comments, I believe 0 he points the gun in the wrong direction: It isn't the Americans who *T*-2 must be criticized *-1 for *PRO*-4 not understanding the Japanese culture, but the Japanese who *T*-3 insist on *PRO*-7 forcing their culture on Americans.
The Japanese want us to accept their culture, but they refuse *PRO*-1 to accept the American culture.
Japanese managers can't expect Americans to behave as if they were Japanese; instead, they must manage Americans as Americans.
Americans are expected *-1 to conform to the Japanese culture when *PRO*-3 in Japan *T*-2.
What is *T*-1 wrong with *PRO* expecting the Japanese to conform to American norms when they locate here *T*-2?
Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas.
European multinationals do likewise; even in America, their affiliates are usually run *-1 by American managers.
But the Japanese insist upon Japanese managers everywhere 0 they set up shop *T*-1.
Do the Japanese feel so superior that they cannot find capable American managers?
Paul A. Herbig Indiana University Bloomington, Ind.
Mr. Kageyama suggests that Kotobuki Electronics Industries workers were having difficulty *PRO*-1 understanding their foreign bosses' perspective.
While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of *PRO* explaining the differences, both cultural and philosophic, I question his perspective.
Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?
Obviously not.
Thus the conclusion is that the burden *ICH*-1 rests with management *PRO* to understand / adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating *T*-2.
The workers can be motivated *-1, and the company reach its full potential, only when management embraces the employees' perspective *T*-3.
A. Lawton Langford President Municipal Code Corp . Tallahassee, Fla.
I believe 0 Mr. Kageyama left out one major aspect of Japanese culture that *T*-1 permeated his piece: the belief in the superiority of Japanese culture and behavior vs. others.
A manager should not have *-1 to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.
Instead, he should listen *PRO*-2 to see how that criticism can be used *-1 constructively *PRO* to advance his objective of *PRO* carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates *T*-3.
Japanese culture vs. American culture is irrelevant.
The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another *T*-1.
For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of *PRO* doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.
The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity *PRO* to synthesize a new corporate culture based * on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures.
Mr. Kageyama is accurate *PRO*-1 to deny a specific anti-American bias.
It *EXP*-1 is more difficult *PRO* to deny a general bigotry in *PRO* seeing things only the Japanese way.
When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without *PRO* altering the reasons for the criticism *T*-2, I am convinced that Mr. Kageyama has still failed *-1 to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms.

Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said 0 business failures fell 17.8% to 11,586 in the third quarter from 14,099 in the year - earlier period.
In the first nine months of this year, business failures dropped 15.6% to 37,820 from 44,796.
Except for a few spots, notably Georgia, Virginia and Michigan, failures declined almost across the board, according to the business information services company.
D&B defines a business failure as a company that *T*-1 closes with losses to creditors.
The current decline in failures continues a trend begun * in late 1987, D&B said 0 *T*-1.
The drop accelerated in this year's third quarter, *PRO* underscoring an overall lack of stress in the U.S. economy, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10% in the nine months.
The South Atlantic States were the only region 0 *T*-1 to report an increase in bankruptcies, up 5.3% to 5,791 from 5,502.
This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged.
The only industry sector 0 *T*-1 to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance, insurance and real - estate sector, where bankruptcies grew 8.1% to 2,046 from 1,892 *T*-2.
The troubled savings - and - loan industry and subsequent stress in real - estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector, D&B said 0 *T*-1.
Bob Evans Inc. said 0 its board authorized the purchase of as many as 500,000 shares of its common.
The stock, 0 *T*-3 to be purchased *-2 on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, will be held *-1 as treasury shares for stock options or other general corporate purposes.

One day last March, CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here.
Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more *U* for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway.
The CBS official said 0 that price sounded fine.
At that price, CBS was the only player at the table when negotiations with the International Olympic Committee started in Toronto Aug. 23 *T*-1.
Dick Pound, a committee member, began by *PRO*-1 disclosing that ABC and NBC had refused *PRO*-2 to even bid.
Then, he asked Mr. Pilson *PRO*-2 to raise his offer anyway: "If we can have a number that *T*-1 starts with a three, you can have a dea."
Mr. Pilson and his team huddled in a hallway and took just 10 minutes *PRO*-1 to return with a $300 million *U* offer.
Mr. Pound responded, "It's a deal."
A beaming Mr. Pilson announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon.
Mr. Pilson's rivals at ABC and NBC grimaced at the price.
How could CBS get pushed into *PRO*-2 outbidding itself *T*-1?
Well, CBS, *PRO*-1 mired in the ratings cellar and looking to sports as a way out, wanted *PRO*-1 to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from *PRO*-2 getting another chance *PRO* to bid.
But Mr. Pilson has been put *-1 in the uncomfortable role of *PRO* setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights, a frenzy that the networks had hoped *PRO*-2 to avoid *T*-3.
"The price of poker has gone up," crows *T*-1 Charles M. Neinas, the College Football Association's executive director.
With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that *T*-1 may top $2.5 billion *U* for four years of major sports events, the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business.
CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong.
ABC, a unit of Capital Cities / ABC Inc., and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. also risk losses if they outbid CBS for other contracts.
While rights fees head skyward, ad rates won't *?*.
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices.
"The networks are paying too much for rights," warns *T*-1 adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam.
"If they ask advertisers *PRO*-2 to absorb the costs, they're likely *-3 to lose all but a few who *T*-1 need sports, above all."
Viewers may not be cheering, either.
Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials.
At the same time, some sports events will move off "free" television and onto cable or pay - cable, where half the nation's TV homes can't see them *T*-1.
CBS has changed the rules by *PRO*-1 throwing out the old basis for sports bids--that is, can the network alone make a profit on it?
Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that *T*-1 might stick around *PRO*-2 to watch other CBS programs when the game is over *T*-3.
The billion - dollar question is, How much are those benefits worth *T*-1?
Some TV people doubt 0 they will materialize and argue that even if they do *?*, they won't offset the multimillion - dollar deficits that CBS could run up *T*-1.
"As we've seen in the '80s," says *?* Roger Werner, the president of the ESPN sports channel, "those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work.
And three years later, in a sea of red ink, the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1."
CBS pursues top sports "*PRO*-3 to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers," charges 0 *T*-4 Thomas H. Wyman, who *T*-2 was ousted *-1 as chairman of CBS Inc. after Laurence A. Tisch bought a 24.9% stake in the company and took over three years ago.
"They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one.
And they've bought one."
On just three big deals--for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994--Pilson bid a total of $1.64 billion *U*.
That's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing *PRO*-1 to pay *?*.
(After 1992, the winter and summer Olympics will be held *-1 two years apart, with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996.)
Now, Mr. Pilson--a former college basketball player who *T*-1 says 0 a good negotiator needs "a level of focus and intellectual attention" similar to a good athlete - s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness.
Next month, talks *ICH*-1 will begin on two coveted CBS contracts, for the pro and college basketball finals.
CBS is likely *-2 to spend whatever it takes *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to keep them.
The potential bill: more than $600 million *U* for several seasons, an 80% jump.
A few months later, CBS's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal; they could go for close to $100 million *U* more than CBS now pays *?*, a 40% to 50% *U* rise.
"What *T*-1 happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports," says *T*-2 Peter Lund, a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc.
J. William Grimes, former president of ESPN, says 0 NBC may "come in with a huge bid for college basketball *PRO*-1 to take it away from CBS and say, ` We can overbid, too . '
And the winners will be the colleges, not either network.
Nor, by the way, advertisers."
Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender.
In the mid-1980s, after ABC had just bid a record $309 million *U* for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for *PRO*-1 paying reckless prices.
"I love Pilson, but he was the guy who *T*-1 complained most bitterly and loudly," says *T*-2 Robert Wussler, a former CBS Sports president.
"And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today *T*-1."
Rivals carp at "the principle of Pilson," as NBC's Arthur Watson once put it--"he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy."
But the 49 - year - old Mr. Pilson is hardly a man 0 *T*-1 to ignore the numbers.
*PRO*-1 A Yale law school graduate, he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency.
In 1976, he joined CBS Sports *PRO*-1 to head business affairs and, five years later, became its president.
Mr. Pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago *T*-1, "I didn't say forever, and I didn't say every property."
The market changed, he adds 0 *T*-1.
And he isn't the only big spender: NBC will pay a record $401 million *U* for the 1992 Summer Games, and ESPN, 80% - owned by Capital Cities / ABC, will shell out $400 million *U* for four years of baseball, *PRO*-1 airing 175 regular - season games a year.
"Our competitors say 0 we overbid them.
Who *T*-1 cares?
Maybe we recognize values 0 the other guys don't *?* *T*-2," Mr. Pilson says *T*-1.
Mr. Pilson's "Major Events" strategy jelled after Mr. Tisch took over.
Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986, after CBS's annual meeting in Philadelphia, he and Mr. Tisch took the 90 - minute train ride back to New York, and Mr. Pilson used this extended private audience *PRO*-1 to outline his ambitions.
Mr. Tisch, a billionaire in hotels and finance, was just learning the TV business.
Five months later, Mr. Tisch took over as CBS's chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time 0 Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators *T*-1.
Then, in May 1988, Mr. Tisch urgently needed *-1 to make a bold statement *PRO*-1 to quell rumors that he might sell the network.
Mr. Pilson gave him one: He bid $243 million *U* for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; ABC and NBC wouldn't bid even $200 million *U*.
That started the still - raging bidding wars.
The "Major Events" strategy, Mr. Pilson says 0 *?*, is designed *-2 *PRO* to notch a place for CBS on the crowded TV dial of the 1990s.
It's also a fast fix for an ailing image.
He sees flashy sports as the only way 0 the last - place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later *T*-1.
Next October, CBS, for the first time, won't have *-1 to start the season against the much - watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series.
"I've been struggling against that for years," says *T*-2 Jonathan Rodgers, who *T*-1 runs WBBM - TV, the CBS - owned station in Chicago.
Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS--and he doesn't think 0 it will *?*--"I'd rather *ICH*-1 see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC," he says 0 *T*-2.
That isn't surprising.
Regular TV series ratings have slumped in the past five years, and *PRO* premiering new shows is "a crap shoot," Mr. Pilson says 0 *T*-1.
But top sports events are still a strong bet *PRO* to lure audiences 30% or 40% larger than those 0 CBS usually gets *T*-1.
Mr. Pilson says 0 baseball and the Olympics may help CBS move up to No. 2 in the household ratings race, *PRO*-1 putting pizazz back into the network's image.
And the Winter Olympics will air during the February "sweeps," when ratings are used *-2 *PRO* to set ad rates for local stations *T*-1.
That will please once - grumpy affiliates--another aim of the Pilson plan.
They gleefully await the "dream season" in 1990.
CBS will air the Super Bowl, baseball playoffs, college and pro basketball finals and other premier sports events.
"It's made me more committed to CBS," says *T*-2 Philip A. Jones, the president of Meredith Corp.'s broadcast group, which *T*-1 has two CBS affiliates.
The CBS plan *PRO* to use big - time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success, however.
No amount of hype will bring viewers back if the shows are weak.
"In this market of 40 channels, sophisticated viewers and the remote control, trial isn't a guarantee of anything," ESPN's Mr. Werner says *T*-1.
"If the show ain't a killer, they're gone."
During the 1984 Summer Games, for example, ABC touted "Call to Glory," but the military drama was missing in action within weeks.
Last October, during the 1988 Summer Games, NBC relentlessly pitched a new series, "Tattingers."
It belly - flopped anyway.
Moreover, sports is hardly the best way 0 *PRO* to lure adult women *T*-1.
Though CBS might move up to No. 2 in household ratings, most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49.
CBS may remain a distant No. 3 in that regard.
Nor is CBS a shoo - in 0 *T*-1 to get blockbuster ratings.
In recent years, the World Series and the Olympics were aired *-1 against CBS's last - place lineup.
But CBS will put the athletes up against Bill Cosby, "Cheers" and other shows in NBC's No. 1 schedule.
Even the boon to affiliate relations may be limited.
The sports lineup may add only 1% to 5% *U* to a station's annual profits.
It alone isn't likely *-1 to stop a station from *PRO*-2 dumping CBS shows.
"The World Series, seven nights, wasn't enough of an incentive," says *T*-2 Arnold Klinsky of WHEC - TV in Rochester, which *T*-1 dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago.
"You've got *-1 to judge where the network will be *T*-2 in three years."
The intangible benefits may prove *-1 extremely costly if CBS can't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself.
And *PRO* avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort.
On the $1.06 billion *U* baseball agreement alone, CBS is likely *-2 to lose $250 million *U* in four years, contends 0 *T*-1 Mr. Wussler, the former CBS man, now at Comsat Inc.
Nevertheless, he deems the deal "plain smart" for its huge promotional value.
Mr. Pilson calls that loss estimate *PRO*-2 "wildly inaccurate," *PRO*-1 conceding only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year.
"It's too early *PRO* to tell" what *T*-1 happens *T*-1 after that, he says 0 *T*-2.
But Mr. Tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract, he told U.S. senators 0 *T*-1 last June.
CBS will pay an average of $82 million *U* more *ICH*-1 each year than ABC and NBC had paid *?* together--and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season.
Yet CBS will air only 12 regular - season games, 26 fewer than ABC and NBC.
That has outraged some fans.
It also indicates a $50 million *U* drop in ad sales for regular - season games--a risk 0 CBS took *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games.
If the playoffs end in four - game sweeps, losses could soar.
Advertisers are resisting higher prices, which *T*-1 would help *PRO* close the gap.
CBS signed General Motors and Toyota *PRO*-1 to be the only auto - maker sponsors in baseball for four years.
Price: $265 million *U*.
But ad executives who *T*-1 negotiated the deal say 0 that works out to only $275,000 *U* for a 30 - second ad in the World Series through 1993--17% less than what ABC is charging *T*-2 for the Series this month.
Moreover, "there's no question 0 ad rates will come down considerably" from the GM - Toyota price, says 0 *T*-1 Arnold Chase of Bozell Inc.
Other admen, however, say 0 rates could rise later if ad spending surges.
The Winter Games outlook also is mixed.
CBS expects *PRO*-1 to make modest profits, but rivals contend that it will take a beating.
ABC lost $75 million *U* on the 1988 Winter Games, partly because of its $309 million *U* rights fee.
It aired 94.5 hours of mostly live events in Calgary--*PRO* helping *PRO* raise ratings slightly from 1984--but still failed *-1 to deliver the audience promised * to advertisers.
CBS will add 25 1/2 hours to that load in 1992, and ratings could be hurt *-1 by a lack of live events.
All prime - time fare will be on tape - delay because of time differences with Norway, so the results can be announced *-1 on the 6 o'clock news.
(Turner Broadcasting will pay CBS $25 million *U* *PRO*-1 to air 50 hours of CBS coverage plus 50 hours of additional events.)
Barry Frank, the agent who *T*-1 took Mr. Pilson to lunch last March, says that even if CBS loses, say, $10 million *U*, it matters little.
"Ten million ain't jack, man, when you got $3 billion *U* sitting in the bank *T*-1," says *T*-2 Mr. Frank, senior vice president at International Management Group, *PRO*-3 citing CBS's enormous cash reserves from *PRO* selling off various businesses.
"It doesn't mean anything--it's public - relations money."
Moreover, sports has "claimed its place" as a guaranteed ratings - getter, says 0 *T*-1 David J. Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association.
"This isn't outlandish bidding; this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it....
I would tend *-1 to trust their judgment."
That's easy 0 for him to say *T*-2: CBS's four - year NBA pact, now at $176 million *U* for four years, could double in price by the time 0 his talks with Mr. Pilson are completed *-1 *T*-3 later this month.
That would cut into CBS's slim margin for profit--and error.
CBS Sports earned $50 million or so *U* last year.
And CBS takes in the least money in prime time; ABC and NBC charge 30% to 35% *U* more for ads, according to a Variety survey.
But CBS's costs are huge, and the risks go up with each new sports package that CBS locks up *T*-1.
Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% *U* in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%.
CBS hopes *PRO*-1 to save money by *PRO*-2 ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time.
But the savings will be minuscule.
Each hour of Olympics and baseball in prime time will cost CBS $2.6 million to $2.8 million *U*; an hour - long drama costs only $900,000 *U*, and it is aired *-1 twice.
CBS may cushion losses with about $200 million *U* a year in interest earned * on the proceeds from *PRO* selling CBS Records and other businesses.
But media - stock analyst Richard J. MacDonald of MacDonald Grippo Riely says 0 Wall Street won't take kindly to that.
"On a *PRO* stand - alone basis, the network ought *-1 to make money," he says *T*-2.
When Mr. Pilson is asked *-1 directly *T*-2--can you make money on all this?--he doesn't exactly say yes.
"What you're really asking *T*-1 is, Are the profit and loss margins anticipated * on the events acceptable to management?" he says *T*-2.
Then, he answers his own question.
"Yes, they are *?*.
That's the only question 0 we need *-2 to address *T*-1.
Italian car manufacturer Fiat said 0 it isn't interested in partnership *RNR*-1 or industrial cooperation *RNR*-1 with Swedish auto and aerospace group Saab - Scania AB, which *T*-2 faces heavy losses in its car division.
Fiat said 0 it's only interested in technical cooperation with Saab.
"We know that Saab is looking for a partner for industrial and financial cooperation," Fiat said *T*-1.
"But that partner isn't Fiat."
The Italian auto maker confirmed that it was discussing technical cooperation with Saab, but declined *PRO*-1 to comment on rumors that it was planning *PRO*-2 to buy Saab's car division.
Fiat's rejection of partnership with Saab means that the Swedish company, which *T*-1 announced last Friday that its pretax profit for the first eight months plummeted 49%, will have *-2 to look for a partner among other car manufacturers as both Ford Motor Corp. and Fiat have turned down the offer.
News reports said yesterday that Saab is trying *PRO*-1 to start negotiations with French automakers Peugeot and Renault.
Toshiba Corp. said 0 its new French marketing concern has started *-2 operating under the aegis of the company's West German subsidiary, which *T*-1 formerly handled all sales of Toshiba electronic products in France.

Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. unit, said 0 the Intelsat VI commercial communications satellite is set *PRO*-2 to be launched *-1 Friday.

Comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan lent some support to the dollar, but the U.S. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies.
Foreign - exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street.
Traders said that Mr. Greenspan, whose statements *T*-1 are ordinarily cautious, was especially careful *PRO*-2 to avoid any jarring proclamations, with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets.
*PRO*-1 Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said 0 the short - term value of the dollar on foreign - exchange markets isn't the primary policy focus of the central bank.
"Our essential focus is on domestic policy," Mr. Greenspan said *T*-2, *PRO*-1 referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy.
In perhaps his most telling remark, Mr. Greenspan termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5% as "much too high 0 *T*-2 to be ignored *-1."
He added, however, that inflation could be brought *-1 down "close to zero" without *PRO* throwing the economy into a recession.
Analysts viewed the chairman's comments as an indication that the central bank is disinclined *PRO*-1 to ease monetary policy further in the near future.
The dollar climbed immediately higher on news of Mr. Greenspan's testimony, *PRO*-1 settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of today's preliminary report on third - quarter U.S. gross national product.

Many traders forecast a continuation of the market's recent bearish trend and predict 0 the U.S. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower.
But according to Doug Madison, a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles, a large number of short positions must first be corrected *-1, *PRO* spurring a temporary upswing, before the unit can turn lower.
He predicts a downward move in dollar - mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar - yen, *PRO*-2 noting that there continues *-3 to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities, which *T*-1 could provide a solid base for the dollar at around 140 yen.
Market participants hope 0 today's GNP report will offer more substantial evidence on U.S. economic growth, although analysts are quick *PRO*-1 to point out that the figures may overstate the economy's vigor.
"The ` r' word is looming again," says *T*-1 one dealer, *PRO*-2 referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the U.S. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession.
Some dealers note that while the third - quarter figures may appear *-2 relatively bullish--the market consensus calls for a 2.5% annual growth rate, unchanged from the second - quarter rate--it *EXP*-1 would take a significantly stronger figure *PRO* to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening.
Some analysts reckon that the next quarter's figures will present a more accurate picture of the U.S. economy, *PRO*-1 showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors, including housing starts and equities.

As a presidential candidate in 1980, George Bush forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published * that March.
What did he think *T*-1 of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion?
"I happen *-2 to think 0 it was right," Mr. Bush said *T*-1 flatly.
A few months later, Mr. Bush became Ronald Reagan's running mate.
Suddenly, George Bush the pro-choice advocate became George Bush the anti-abortionist.
And the vacillation didn't end there.
Just a month ago, Mr. Bush sternly threatened *PRO*-1 to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds, except *PRO* to save a woman's life.
Then, two weeks ago--*PRO*-1 declaring that "I'm not looking for any conflict over this"--the president said 0 he would consider a compromise *PRO* to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest.
But only four days after that, Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat.
"I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother's life is threatened *-1 *T*-2," he proclaimed *T*-3, and finally vetoed the measure last weekend.
So what does George Bush really believe *T*-1?
The answer is so murky that it is beginning *-1 to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal, increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue.
The result is mistrust and criticism from all around.
Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally.
"In all honesty if you ask me, ` Is this man a true believer?' I don't know," says *T*-1 John Fowler, head of the Washington - based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc.
Yet abortion - rights forces remain bitterly critical.
Douglas Gould, vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, calls Mr. Bush's position on the abortion - funding issue *PRO*-2 "extremely cruel," *PRO*-1 adding: "The guy hasn't done one thing about prevention.
He's totally geared to a punitive position."
Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question.
For most of the past nine years, he has striven *PRO*-1 to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position.
But ever since the Supreme Court's Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue, the president seemingly has tried just as hard *PRO*-1 to avoid saying anything more unless *PRO*-2 pressed to the wall.
Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion.
Mr. Bush's problem isn't so much *ICH*-2 that he seems *-1 to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems *-3 to vacillate on it.
The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it, experts insist 0 *T*-1.
"If you have a position, you're better off *PRO* to stick with it than *PRO* to move around very much," says *T*-1 Republican strategist John Sears.
The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush, who *T*-1, Mr. Sears maintains 0 *?*, lacks a strong ideological base.
By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who *T*-1 say 0 the issue is vital to younger voters, the president might seem *-2 to have at least some sympathy with abortion - rights arguments.
Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard - line rhetoric and promises 0 he made *T*-1 to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House.
On many issues--flag - burning, for instance--his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts.
But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue, *PRO*-2 failing *-3 to grasp how dramatically the abortion - rights movement would be aroused *-1 *T*-4 following last summer's Supreme Court decision *PRO* to restrict those rights in the Webster case.
"It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes 0 I've ever seen *T*-1," says *T*-2 former Reagan pollster Richard Wirthlin.
These days, when others raise the subject of abortion *T*-1, the usually loquacious president can be close - mouthed almost to the point of curtness.
Ten days ago he was asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance.
"My position is well - known and well - stated," he replied *T*-1.
A close look at his record over the last 15 years suggests that Mr. Bush has well - stated his views--on all sides of the issue.
In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in *PRO* expanding family - planning services for the poor *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as *PRO*-1 supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and *PRO* to save the life of the mother.
In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980, Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion - rights remarks *PRO*-1 to contrast himself with his rival, Ronald Reagan.
In addition to *PRO*-1 supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, Mr. Bush said 0 he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising *PRO*-2 to promote *T*-3.
As Mr. Reagan's running mate, though, Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position, *PRO*-1 endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan--that the amendment ought *-1 to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as *PRO* to save a woman's life.
Throughout the early 1980s, Mr. Bush was quoted *-1 *PRO*-1 sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it.
In April 1986, then - Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment, but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case.
At the GOP convention last year, he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape, incest and life endangerment.
His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office, *PRO*-1 affirming his "firm support of our cause" during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January.
He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
But when the high court ruled in the Webster case in July *T*-1, the president began *-2 to lower the volume.
When the ruling was handed down *T*-1, the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu *PRO*-3 to issue a statement and refused *PRO*-2 to answer questions himself.
He did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring the District of Columbia's right *PRO* to use its own tax money *PRO*-1 to fund abortions for poor women and over *PRO* restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund.
But in the months since then, while *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to drum up support for other issues--such as an anti-flag - burning constitutional amendment--he has shied away from *PRO*-1 talking about abortion.
What few comments he has initiated *T*-3 have been oblique, such as *PRO* urging "greater efforts toward the protection of human life" at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month.
The White House has likewise avoided any involvement in Florida's recent special legislative session on abortion, which anti-abortion forces *T*-1 had regarded *-2 as a key test of their ability *PRO* to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions.
The session failed *-1 to enact any new curbs.
Now, some see Mr. Bush trapped *-3 in a position 0 he is neither comfortable with *T*-1 nor able *PRO*-2 to escape *T*-1.
Ken Ruberg, head of the Republican Mainstream Committee, a group of party moderates, observes: "The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it *EXP*-1 difficult--if not impossible--*PRO* to get itself out of *T*-2.
U.S. Memories Inc., the venture that *T*-1 seeks *PRO*-2 to crack Japan's domination of the memory - chip market, said 0 it has chosen four potential sites for its operations after a fierce bidding war by 15 states.
U.S. Memories said 0 it will begin visits during the next several weeks to sites in Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colo.; Middletown, N.Y.; and Phoenix, Ariz.
Sanford Kane, president, said 0 the finalists were chosen *-1 from among 57 locations based on financial, business, and quality of life considerations.
Conspicuous by its absence is *T*-1 California.
San Jose and several other California cities mounted major campaigns *ICH*-2 during the summer *PRO* to woo the group, which *T*-4 was founded *-3 last June by seven electronics concerns.
The venture plans *PRO*-1 to announce a final site by late November.
It expects *PRO*-1 to begin construction by year end and start shipping four - megabit dynamic random - access memory chips by mid-1991.
U.S. Memories investors include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett - Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp., and National Semiconductor Corp.
Mr. Kane said 0 he expects several other companies to join some time after the venture completes a business plan, probably later this week.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data, video and voice communications.
Two products in what the telecommunications giant called *T*-2 *PRO*-4 a new generation of such equipment are available now, AT&T said 0 *?*, and three others will be introduced *-1 in 1990 and 1991.
The products are aimed *-1 at a market expected * to total more than $1 billion *U* a year in sales by 1995, said 0 *T*-2 Morgan Buchner Jr., vice president of transmission systems for AT&T.
The products already available are cross-connect systems, used * instead of mazes of wiring *PRO* to interconnect other telecommunications equipment.
This cuts down greatly on labor, Mr. Buchner said 0 *T*-1.
*PRO*-6 To be introduced *-1 later are *T*-5 a multiplexer, which *T*-2 will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line; a light - wave system, which *T*-3 carries voice channels; and a network controller, which *T*-4 directs data flow through cross-connect systems.
AT&T said 0 the products, unlike previous generations, will meet so - called Sonet compatability standards, which AT&T expects *T*-1 to be broadly adopted *-2.
Sonet, or synchronous optical network, products have more capacity than earlier models.
"These products are the heart of our transmission - product line," Mr. Buchner said *T*-1.
He declined *PRO*-2 to disclose specific prices, but said 0 each product costs in the tens of thousands *RNR*-1, or even hundreds of thousands *RNR*-1, of dollars.
AT&T said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to beat to the marketplace two rivals, Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and France's Alcatel N.V., which *T*-1 also have announced Sonet - based products.
AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products.
It noted that last July, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T 0 *T*-1 to supply $154 million *U* of such equipment over a four - year period starting next year.
NICHOLS INSTITUTE declared a 2 - for - 1 split of its common stock, payable Nov. 27 to stock of record Nov. 10.
The clinical testing services holding company is based *-1 in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
Early this century, diamond mining in the magnificent dunes where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean *T*-1 was a day at the beach.
Men would crawl in the sand *PRO*-1 looking for shiny stones.
It was as easy as *PRO* collecting sea shells at Malibu.
Men are still combing the beach with shovels and hand brushes, *PRO*-1 searching for that unusual glint.
But only after a fleet of 336 gargantuan earthmoving vehicles belonging to De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's diamond kingpins, do their work.
Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved *-1 from one dune to another *PRO* to recover 934,242 carats, which *T*-2 comes to 46 tons of sand per carat, or one - fifth gram.
Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed *-1 back 300 yards.
"If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them," says *T*-1 Les Johns, De Beers's engineering manager.
Here, *PRO*-1 wedged *-2 between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box.
Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature--first in the gentle current of the Orange River that *T*-1 carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert--98% of the diamonds uncovered * are of gem quality.
While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use.
Since this treasure chest is too big *PRO*-2 to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned *-1 into one.
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who *T*-1 controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert--about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic--a restricted area, a designation normally reserved * for military operations.
When the Germans lost World War I *T*-1, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers.
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval.
The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa.
Ghost towns dot the Namib dunes, *PRO*-1 proving 0 diamonds aren't forever.
Oranjemund, the mine headquarters, is a lonely corporate oasis of 9,000 residents.
Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert *PRO*-1 to drink from water sprinklers.
On most days, the desert's heat and the cool of the ocean combine *PRO*-1 to create a mist like a damp rag.
The wind, *PRO*-2 stinging with sand, never seems *-2 to stop.
Still, miners from all parts of Namibia as well as professional staff from De Beers's head offices in South Africa and London keep coming.
And Oranjemund boasts attractions besides diamonds.
There are six video rental shops, three restaurants, one cinema and 34 sports and recreation clubs for everything from cricket to lawn bowling.
The pride of Oranjemund is the 18 - hole golf course--with the largest sand trap in the world.
Last year, when the rising Orange River threatened *PRO*-3 to swamp the course *T*-2, the same engineers who *T*-1 are pushing back the Atlantic rushed *PRO*-4 to build a wall 0 *T*-5 to hold back the flood.
"Nothing is too good for our golf course," says *T*-1 Tony George, a mining engineer.
Despite fears 0 the mine may be partially nationalized *-2 by the new Namibian government following next month's elections freeing the country from South African control, De Beers engineers are working *PRO*-1 to extend the mine's productive life for another 25 years, from the current estimate of 10.
Huge machines that *T*-1 look as though they came from the Star Wars desert - battle scene lumber among the dunes.
Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, *PRO*-1 shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss - cross the beach.
Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean.
*PRO*-2 Made *-1 of sand, it receives around - the - clock maintainence against the battering waves.
When the mining in front of the wall is complete *T*-2, it is moved *-1 northward.
A companion jetty that *T*-1 helps *PRO* hold back the sea looks like a rusting junkyard.
Engineers first used concrete blocks *PRO*-1 to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood.
Then someone decided *PRO*-2 to try broken - down earthmoving equipment that, inexplicably, *T*-1 held against the waves.
"The Caterpillar people aren't too happy when they see their equipment used *-3 like that *T*-2," shrugs *T*-1 Mr. George.
"They figure 0 it's not a very good advert."
Despite all these innovations, most of the diamonds are still found *-2 in the sand swept * away by the men wielding shovels and brushes--the ignominiously named "bedrock sweepers" who *T*-1 toil in the wake of the excavators.
*PRO*-1 Laboring in blue and gray overalls, they are supposed *-1 to concentrate on *PRO* cleaning out crevices, and not strain their eyes *PRO*-2 looking for diamonds.
But should they spy one, the company will pay a bonus equal to one - third its value.
For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough *PRO* to overcome the temptation *PRO* to steal--a crime that *T*-1 could earn them up to 15 years in jail.
Still, employees do occasionally try *PRO*-1 to smuggle out a gem or two.
One man wrapped several diamonds in the knot of his tie.
Another poked a hole in the heel of his shoe.
A food caterer stashed stones in the false bottom of a milk pail.
None made it past the body searches and X-rays of mine security.
The dollar finished lower yesterday, after *PRO*-1 tracking another rollercoaster session on Wall Street.
Concern about the volatile U.S. stock market had faded in recent sessions, and traders appeared *-3 content *PRO*-4 to let the dollar languish in a narrow range until tomorrow, when the preliminary report on third - quarter U.S. gross national product is released *-1 *T*-2.
But seesaw gyrations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday put Wall Street back in the spotlight and inspired market participants *PRO*-1 to bid the U.S. unit *PRO*-2 lower.
UAL's decision *PRO* to remain an independent company sent share prices *PRO*-1 tumbling.
By midmorning, the DJIA had plunged 80 points and foreign - exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down.
When the DJIA modestly rebounded *T*-1, the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday.
Stock prices, meanwhile, posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day.
Some dealers said that the market's strong reaction to Wall Street reflects a general uneasiness about the dollar.
They added that the DJIA's swift drop proved an easy excuse 0 for the market to drive the U.S. currency in the direction 0 it was already headed *-2 *T*-1 *T*-3.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8355 marks, down from 1.8470 marks Monday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 141.90 yen late Monday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.6055 *U*, up from $1.6030 *U* late Monday.
In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.57 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen.
Tom Trettien, a vice president with Banque Paribas in New York, sees a break in the dollar's long - term upward trend, a trend that *T*-1 began in January 1988.
He argues that the dollar is now "moving sideways," *PRO*-1 adding that "the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase."
Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy, highlighted * by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap.
They also point out that narrowing interest - rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend *-1 to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors.
Despite several spurts of dollar trading, it was noted *-1 that mark - yen cross trade grabbed much of the market's attention.
Following the dive in U.S. stocks, the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts.
Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials.
But, they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments.
"The question *ICH*-1 remains: how much can the West German market absorb *T*-2?" says *T*-3 one senior dealer.
Some dealers say that Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy won't be changed *-1 for the time being has given investors an added excuse 0 *PRO* to push the yen down even further against the mark *T*-2.
Despite the yen's weakness with respect to the mark, Tokyo traders say 0 they don't expect the Bank of Japan to take any action *PRO* to support the Japanese currency on that front.
Meanwhile, sterling slumped on news that the United Kingdom posted a wider - than - *PRO* expected *-1 trade deficit in September.
The news also knocked the British unit to below 2.95 marks in London, but a bout of short - covering helped sterling *PRO*-1 recoup some of its earlier losses.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery jumped $3.20 *U* to $370.20 *U* an ounce.
The close was the highest since Aug. 15.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted *-1 at $368.25 *U* an ounce.
Britain's current account deficit dropped to #1.6 billion *U* ($2.56 billion *U*) in September from an adjusted #2 billion *U* ($3.21 billion *U*) the previous month, but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the U.K. economy next year.
The Confederation of British Industry's latest survey shows that business executives expect a pronounced slowdown, largely because of a 16 - month series of interest - rate increases that *T*-1 has raised banks' base lending rates to 15%.
"The outlook has deteriorated since the summer, with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill," said *T*-1 David Wigglesworth, chairman of the industry group's economic committee.
He also said 0 investment by businesses is falling off.
Of 1,224 companies surveyed *, 31% *T*-1 expect *PRO*-2 to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery, while only 28% *T*-1 plan *PRO*-3 to spend more.
But despite mounting recession fears, government data don't yet show the economy grinding to a halt.
Unemployment, for example, has continued *-1 to decline, and the September trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports.
As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isn't currently expected *-1 to ease interest rates before next spring, if then.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation, which *T*-2 was ignited *-1 by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987.
Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies.
*PRO*-3 Fending off attacks on his economic policies in a House of Commons debate yesterday, Mr. Lawson said 0 inflation "remains the greatest threat to our economic well - being" and promised *PRO*-3 to take "whatever steps *T*-2 are needed *-1" *PRO* to choke it off.
The latest government figures said 0 retail prices in September were up 7.6% from a year earlier.
Many economists have started *-1 predicting a mild recession next year.
David Owen, U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2% and termed the risk of recession next year *PRO*-1 "quite high."
But he said 0 the downturn probably won't become a "major contraction" similar to those of 1974 and 1982.
Still, Britain's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the European Community's plan *PRO* to create a unified market by 1992.
Compared with the major economies on the Continent, the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months.
As a result, Mr. Owen warned 0 *?*, investment will be more likely *-2 to flow toward the other European economies and "the U.K. will be less prepared for the single market."
Britain's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy, such as a surge in the volume of exports, which *T*-1 were 8.5% higher than a year earlier.
But while September exports rose to #8.43 billion *U*, imports shot up to #10.37 billion *U*.
The resulting #1.9 billion *U* merchandise trade deficit was partly offset *-2 by an assumed surplus of #300 million *U* in so - called invisible items, which *T*-1 include income from investments, services and official transfers.
Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap, economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about #20 billion *U* from #14.6 billion *U* in 1988.
Increasingly, economists say 0 the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry.
"When the country gets wealthier *T*-1, we tend *-3 to buy high - quality imports," Mr. Owen said *T*-2.
Mexico exported an average of 1,296,800 barrels of crude oil a day at an average of $15.31 *U* a barrel during 1989's first eight months for a total of $4.82 billion *U*, Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. said 0 *T*-1.
The state petroleum monopoly said 0 sales in the period gained 15%, and $262.4 million *U* more than 0 *T*-1 originally projected *-2 at an average of $10 *U* a barrel on an export platform of 1,250,000 barrels a day.
John B. Curcio, 55 years old, resigned as chairman of this diesel truck manufacturer, effective upon appointment of a successor.
Last month, Mr. Curcio was succeeded *-1 by Ralph E. Reins as chief executive officer following several quarters of lackluster or declining performance.
ALBERTA ENERGY Co., Calgary, said 0 it filed a preliminary prospectus for an offering of common shares.
The natural resources development concern said 0 proceeds will be used *-2 *PRO* to repay long - term debt, which *T*-1 stood at 598 million Canadian dollars (US$510.6 million *U*) at the end of 1988.
The company plans *PRO*-1 to raise between C$75 million and C$100 million *U* from the offering, according to a spokeswoman at Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., lead underwriter.
The shares will be priced *-1 in early November, she said 0 *T*-2.
Malcolm S. Todt was named *-1 *PRO*-2 vice president and senior officer in charge of equipment leasing to municipalities, a new effort of this bond insurer.
Mr. Todt had been vice president and treasurer of Insilco Corp.
London share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the back of Wall Street's steep drop and renewed fears over U.K. economic fundamentals.
Tokyo's winning streak came to an end, and stocks fell in Frankfurt and across Europe as well.
London's Financial Times 100 - share index shed 40.4 points *PRO*-1 to finish at 2149.3.
At London's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 51.23 points lower at 2611.68.
Dealers said 0 the initial pressure came from mildly disappointing U.K. trade figures for September and a worrisome report *ICH*-1 by the Confederation of British Industry that a decline in orders for manufactured goods is depressing both business optimism and investment plans for the coming year.
The trade and CBI reports refocused attention on high interest rates and corporate profitability and helped rekindle underlying concerns over prospects for a recession in the U.K., dealers said 0 *T*-1.
The 30 - share index fell 33.3 points to 1739.3.
Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares traded *, but better than the year's lowest turnover of 276.8 million Monday.
Market watchers also noted 0 an absence of institutional interest later in the session helped pave the way for broader declines when Wall Street opened *PRO*-2 weaker *T*-1.
They added that market - makers were knocking share prices down in midafternoon in a bid *PRO* to attract some interest, but the action largely helped open the way for London's late declines.
Insurance stocks provided some early support to the market, partly on favorable brokerage recommendatons and talk of continental European interest in British life and composite insurers.
British life insurer London & General, which *T*-2 firmed 2 pence to 356 pence ($5.70 *U*), and composite insurer Royal Insurance, which *T*-3 finished *PRO*-4 13 lower at 475, were featured *-1 in the talk.
On the life insurance side, Pearl Group finished *PRO*-1 5 lower at 640, and Sun Life dropped 15 to #11.53 *U*.
Jaguar finished *PRO*-1 4 lower at 694.
Dealers said 0 the market didn't react substantially to Ford Motor Co.'s disclosure *ICH*-2 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will seek 100% of Jaguar's shares outstanding when U.K. government share regulations are lifted *-1 at the end of next year *T*-3.
Tokyo stocks closed *PRO*-1 easier, *PRO*-1 posting their first loss in six trading days, partly because of programmed index - linked selling by trust investment funds in the afternoon session.
The Nikkei index fell 58.97 points to 35526.55.
The index gained 99.14 points Monday.
In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index rose 17.92 points to 35544.47.
On Tuesday, the Tokyo stock price index of all first section issues was down 6.31 at 2681.22.
First section volume was estimated *-1 at 900 million shares, up from 605 million Monday.
Observers said 0 the market again failed *-1 to find a trading focus, *PRO* discouraging much participation by investors.
The market, however, is expected *-1 to remain stable and expectations for future gains are high, traders said 0 *T*-2.
Such sentiment is being supported *-1 by word that a large amount of cash from investment trust funds is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to enter the market later this week and in early November.
The expected amount is said *-1 to be 700 billion yen ($4.93 billion *U*) to 1.05 trillion yen--the second largest amount this year in a given period, following the record high set * at the end of July, according to market observers.
In addition to a large amount of investment trust fund cash, analysts generally see the market environment improving compared with the past couple of weeks.
Toshiyuki Nishimura, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities, said, "The market sentiment is bullish, simply because there are few bad factors."
Buying activity Tuesday centered on a wide range of midcapitalization, domestic demand - related shares whose prices *T*-1 range from 1,000 to 2,000 yen.
Investors expect 0 these shares will be targets of investment trust funds, which *T*-1 often buy small amounts spread * across a wide range of issues.
On the other hand, high - priced shares such as Pioneer Electronic and Sony failed *-2 to spark investor interest because these issues are unlikely *-3 to be bought *-1 by investment trust funds, observers said 0 *T*-4.
Tuesday's notable losers were highpriced shares such as Pioneer, which *T*-1 shed 210 yen to 5,900 yen.
Sony was down 130 to 8,590.
TDK fell 120 to 5,960, Fuji Photo Film declined 160 to 4,830, and Fanuc dropped 160 to 7,440.
Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed *PRO*-1 sharply lower in thin dealings as worried investors remained idle as the result of two potentially destabilizing domestic developments.
The DAX index fell 15.85 *PRO*-1 to end at 1507.37.
Cutting against the downward trend was *T*-2 Continental, which *T*-1 jumped 4 marks to 346 marks ($187 *U*) in heavy trading on rumors that the tire maker is about *PRO*-3 to be taken *-4 over.
It jumped 7.5 Monday.
Traders said 0 the market was exceptionally thin, as small investors remain on the sidelines.
Market participants say 0 investors are not only licking their wounds following the turbulence last week, but they have also been made *-1 nervous by two events in West Germany.
On Sunday, the governing Christian Democratic Union suffered a series of setbacks, the extent of which *T*-1 became fully known only late Monday, in municipal elections in Baden - Wuerttemberg.
Traders say 0 investors are worried that the CDU won't be able *PRO*-1 to hold office in federal elections at the end of 1990.
And statements by the chairman of the IG Metall labor union, Franz Steinkuehler, also cast a cloud over trading, dealers said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Steinkuehler said at a convention in West Berlin that the union has *-1 to prepare for "a big fight" *PRO* to achieve its main goal of a 35 - hour workweek, down from current 37 - hour workweek.
The decline in prices cut broadly through the blue - chip issues, as Siemens tumbled 7.5 to 544, Deutsche Bank plunged 7 to 657, and the auto makers fell sharply as well.
Daimler - Benz dropped 12.5 to 710.5, Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 10.5 to 543.5, and Volkswagen lost 7.1.
Elsewhere, share prices closed *PRO*-1 lower in Zurich, Amsterdam, Milan and Stockholm.
Uneasiness about Wall Street was cited *-1 in several markets.
Prices closed *PRO*-1 lower in Sydney, Singapore and Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and higher in Taipei, Manila, Paris, Brussels and Seoul.
Here are *T*-1 price trends on the world's major stock markets, as *PRO* calculated *-2 by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
*PRO* To make them directly comparable, each index is based *-1 on the close of 1969 equaling 100.
The percentage change is since year - end.
President Bush is considering *PRO*-1 casting a line - item veto as a test 0 *T*-2 to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority.
Mr. Bush has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that *T*-2 would explicitly give him a line - item veto, which *T*-1 would enable him *PRO*-3 to kill individual items in a big spending bill without *PRO* having *-4 to kill the entire bill.
He has argued that such presidential power is necessary *PRO* to rein in congressional spending.
But some analysts, particularly conservative legal scholars, have urged Mr. Bush *PRO*-1 not to wait for explicit authorization but *PRO* simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives him the power *PRO* to exercise a line - item veto.
Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that *T*-1 would clarify whether a president already has such power.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, *PRO*-1 confirming comments made * this week by Vice President Dan Quayle, said 0 Mr. Bush is "interested" in *PRO* finding a suitable test case.
But he also said that *PRO* exercising a test line - item veto isn't a "top initiative" on the president's agenda because he faces more - pressing budget issues at the moment.
Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows *?*.
From 1980 to 1988, while federal budget deficits totaled $1.41 trillion *U*, the government issued $394 billion *U* of new direct loans and an additional $756 billion *U* of new primary loan guarantees.
These figures omit secondary guarantees, deposit insurance, and the activities of Government - Sponsored Enterprises (a huge concern in its own right, as *PRO* detailed *-1 on this page May 3).
Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal, and were meant *-1 to break even financially.
Since the 1950s, federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume, subsidy rates, and policy applications, *PRO*-1 spurred *-2 on by the growth of government in general and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular.
As we will see *?*, many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit.
But recent events indicate 0 that federal credit is out of control.
Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%, and the program has been rocked *-1 by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs; losses over the next three years are expected *-1 to exceed $20 billion *U*.
Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years.
Last month, the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as *PRO* previously estimated *-1, and that FHA's equity fell to minus $2.9 billion *U*.
GAO's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $300 billion *U* in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered *-1 one of the most financially secure credit programs.
Scores of other credit programs, *PRO*-1 subsidizing agriculture, small business, exporters, defense, energy, transportation and others, are less visible but in no better shape.
If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering: The federal government holds $222 billion *U* in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion *U* in primary guarantees.
(Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA - and VA - backed loans by the agency known * as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $330 billion *U*.)
Although external events have contributed to the morass, the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs.
*PRO*-2 To reduce the risks while *PRO*-3 still retaining the legitimate benefits 0 these programs can provide *T*-1, credit policy must: 1 . Use credit *PRO*-2 to improve the operation of capital markets, not to provide subsidies.
There is a fundamental conflict between *PRO* providing a subsidy and *PRO* maintaining the integrity of a credit program.
If the program is meant *-1 to provide a subsidy, *PRO* collecting the debt defeats the original goal.
Thus, subsidized loans tend *-1 to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time.
*PRO*-1 To avoid this problem, government should issue credit only if it intends *PRO*-2 to use every legal method *PRO*-3 to collect.
In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools 0 *PRO* to improve the operation of capital markets *T*-1.
For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.
Farm lending was enacted *-1 *PRO* to correct this problem by *PRO* providing a reliable flow of lendable funds.
However, this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans.
Credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that *T*-1 provide the subsidy.
For example, student loans currently attempt *PRO*-1 to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created * by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted *-2 as collateral.
The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family *T*-1 earns less than a particular amount.
High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.
Families that *T*-1 do not need the loan can make money simply by *PRO*-2 putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates *T*-3.
In contrast, a student loan program that *T*-2 was meant solely *-1 to correct capital - market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near - market rates.
While the student was in school, interest costs would either be paid *-1 by the student or added *-1 to the loan balance.
This program, combined * with cash grants to needy students, would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries.
2 . *PRO* Provide better incentives.
Given the structure of most credit programs, it *EXP*-1 is surprising that default rates are not even higher.
Guarantee rates are typically 100%, *PRO* giving lenders little reason 0 *PRO* to screen customers carefully *T*-1.
*PRO* Reducing those rates moderately (say, to 75%) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers.
But it would also encourage lenders *PRO*-1 to choose more creditworthy customers, and go a long way toward *PRO* reducing defaults.
For example, the Small Business Administration has had reasonable success in *PRO*-1 reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its Preferred Lenders' Program.
Borrowers' incentives are equally skewed.
Since the government has a dismal record of *PRO* collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.
In addition, it *EXP*-2 is often possible *PRO* to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid *-1 off.
Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be *PRO* to improve debt collection (*PRO* taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and *PRO* to deny new credit to defaulters.
These provisions would be difficult 0 *PRO* to enforce *T*-2 for a program intended * to provide a subsidy, but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that *T*-1 attempt *PRO*-3 to offset market imperfections.
3 . *PRO* Record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget.
Since the budget measures cash flow, a new $1 *U* direct loan is treated *-1 as a $1 *U* expenditure, even though at least part of the loan will be paid *-2 back.
Loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults, so new guarantees do not raise the deficit, even though they create future liabilities for the government.
By *PRO*-1 converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit.
Predictably, guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion *U* since 1985, while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion *U*.
The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government.
This figure could be estimated *-1 *PRO* using techniques employed * by private lenders *PRO* to forecast losses, or determined *-1 by *PRO* selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees).
Neither technique is perfect, but both are better than the current system, which *T*-1 misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that *T*-2 vary substantially and average about $20 billion *U* annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
A budget that *T*-1 reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives *PRO* to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to *T*-2.
4 . *PRO* Impose standard accounting and administrative practices.
Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit.
Many agencies roll over their debt, *PRO*-1 paying off delinquent loans by *PRO*-2 issuing new loans, or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans.
In any case, they avoid *PRO*-1 having *-2 to write off the loans.
Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books; as late as 1987, the Export - Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made * to Cuba in the 1950s.
More seriously, FmHA has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value.
Until GAO's recent audit, FHA books had not been subject to a complete external audit in 15 years.
The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices, including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits.
*PRO* Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises, provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions, and reduce fraud.
Government lending was not intended *-1 to be a way 0 *PRO* to obfuscate spending figures, hide fraudulent activity, or provide large subsidies *T*-2.
The reforms described * above would provide a more limited, but clearer, safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender.
Without such reforms, credit programs will continue *-1 to be a large - scale, high - risk proposition for taxpayers.
Mr. Gale is an assistant professor of economics at UCLA.
Wang Laboratories Inc. has sold $25 million *U* of assets and reached agreements *ICH*-1 in principle *PRO* to sell an additional $187 million *U* shortly, Richard Miller, president, said 0 *T*-2 at the annual meeting.
He said 0 Wang had reached an agreement *ICH*-1 with a "major financial firm" *PRO* to sell for $150 million *U* its domestic equipment lease portfolio and that of its Wang Credit Corp. subsidiary.
He said 0 it also agreed *PRO*-1 to sell a portion of its European real estate unit for $37 million *U*.
Mr. Miller said that Wang has already sold some $12 million *U* of miscellaneous assets and disclosed that it had received $13 million *U* from Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, in the previously announced sale of its Stirling, Scotland, plant.
Mr. Miller repeated that in the next six months he plans *PRO*-1 to sell another $200 million to $300 million *U* of assets *PRO*-2 to repay debt and reduce interest costs at Wang, a minincomputer maker in Lowell, Mass.
In response to questions after the annual meeting, Mr. Miller said 0 the company is no longer looking for an equity investor.
During the summer, Wang executives had said 0 they might seek outside investment.
The House approved a short - term spending bill 0 *T*-1 to keep the government *PRO*-2 operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion *U* in emergency funds *PRO* to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.
The 321 - 99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance, but the cost to the Treasury is sure *-1 to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm - Rudman deficit reduction law.
By a lopsided 401 - 18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort *PRO* to waive Gramm - Rudman for purposes of *PRO* addressing the two disasters, and budget analysts estimate 0 the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion *U* unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found *-19 by Congress.
The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district *T*-1 was at the center of the earthquake last week.
*PRO*-1 Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. Panetta demanded 0 the costs be fully counted *-2.
His prominent role put him in the awkward position of *PRO* challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent *T*-1 in the months ahead.
"We do not come to this House *PRO*-1 asking for any handout," said *T*-2 the California Democrat.
"We do not intend *PRO*-1 to hide these costs from the American people."
The $2.85 billion *U* package incorporates $500 million *U* for low - interest disaster loans, $1 billion *U* in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion *U* divided * between general emergency assistance and a reserve 0 *T*-1 to be available to President Bush *PRO*-2 to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
The funds are in addition to $1.1 billion *U* appropriated * last month *PRO* to assist in the recovery from Hugo, *PRO* bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $4 billion *U* in unanticipated spending.
Because of the vagaries of Gramm - Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small.
But the appropriations set in motion spending that *T*-1 adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991.
Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted *-1 against the share of funds 0 *T*-4 to be allocated *-2 to those subcommittees that *T*-3 recently have had the greatest difficulty in *PRO* staying within the budget.
The underlying bill approved * yesterday is required *-2 *PRO* to keep the government *PRO*-3 operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed--and, critics say 0 *?*, mistakes--that *T*-1 have accompanied the package of disaster assistance.
The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by *PRO*-2 requiring it *PRO*-3 to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than *PRO* otherwise would be required *-1.
And the state's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted *-1 against a separate $185 million *U* in federal highway funds 0 it would expect *PRO*-3 to receive *T*-2 under its normal allocation this year.
Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average.
For example, disaster loans, which *T*-1 will go to small businesses and homeowners, offer credit as low as 4% in some cases.
But the San Francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted *-1 to $500,000 *U* from $100,000 *U* *PRO* to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district.
The Senate is expected *-1 to make some modifications today, but both the White House and Congress appear *-2 most anxious *PRO*-3 to speed final approval before tonight's deadline.
Administration pressure discourages any effort *PRO* to add to total funding, and the Senate changes are expected *-1 to be largely technical--*PRO*-3 dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total Small Business Administration loans to $1.8 billion *U* *PRO*-2 to accommodate the increased activity expected *.
Yesterday's floor action came as a House - Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion *U* fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad.
An estimated $25.8 million *U* is allocated *-1 *PRO* to continue work in Oman.
But all funding *ICH*-3 is cut *-1 for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut *-2 to $13.6 million *U*, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.
Closer to home, the negotiators were more generous.
An estimated $38.9 million *U* was set *-1 aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.
And $70.2 million *U* would go to projects in Tennessee represented * by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser.
Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is *T*-1 the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va .) even added report language listing $49.4 million *U* in projects 0 he wants *T*-1 in the budget next year.
No individual illustrated this mix of power more *ICH*-2 yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), who *T*-1 chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.
In the final trading, the House was insistent on *PRO* setting aside $500 million *U* *PRO* to carry out base closings ordered * *PRO*-1 to begin in fiscal 1990.
But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million *U* parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision *PRO* to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.
The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest.
Mr. Inouye, who *T*-1 chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs, used his power *PRO*-2 to move $400,000 *U* from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs *PRO* to assist in *PRO* renovating a decommissoned base *PRO* to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.
Meanwhile, House - Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion *U* anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, *PRO*-2 cutting other federal spending 0.43% *PRO*-1 to pay for it.
A formal House - Senate conference is expected *-1 to ratify the accord later this week.
Medieval philosophers used *-1 to hold the sensible belief that it *EXP*-3 was more perfect *ICH*-2 *PRO* to exist than *PRO* not to exist, and that *PRO* to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all.
Now, only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity; it is built *-1 into His nature.
But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species.
Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called * *PRO*-1 evolution?
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life, then it was only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed * with reason, self - awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene.
Now along comes *T*-1 Stephen Jay Gould *PRO*-2 to dash this flattering illusion.
His credentials are excellent for the task.
*PRO*-1 Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist.
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed * down from Darwin.
For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one - in - a - million shot *T*-1.
In "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History" (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95 *U*), Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution."
The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called * *PRO*-1 the Burgess Shale.
Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay *PRO*-5 buried *-6 traces of countless weird creatures that *T*-4 had frolicked more than 500 million years ago--creatures whose anatomical variety *T*-2 far exceeded what *T*-3 can be found *-1 in all the world's oceans today.
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who *T*-1 discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.
Accordingly, the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned *-1 into familiar categories.
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began *-2 to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.
By *PRO*-2 making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three - dimensional structures *T*-1, this trio was able *PRO*-2 to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.
One was so fantastic in appearance, 0 it was dubbed *-1 *PRO*-2 Hallucigenia.
*PRO* Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.
A good deal of the book *ICH*-1 is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, "Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma."
Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to *PRO* discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution *T*-1.
Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen * on the earth.
The vast majority of them, however, were wiped *-2 out by a succession of environmental upheavals that *T*-1 were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate.
Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery "in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues *T*-1.
" So much for survival of the fittest.
So much, too, for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by *PRO*-1 evolving big brains.
Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that *T*-1 did in the dinosaurs because they were small, not smart.
If anyone has difficulty *PRO*-2 imagining a world in which history went merrily on without us *T*-1, Mr. Gould sketches several.
In one, birds are the dominant carnivores; in another the seas abound with "little penises."
Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing *T*-2, it seems 0 *?*, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called * *PRO*-3 Pikaia.
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; *PRO*-1 like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility."
I, by contrast, cannot help *PRO* feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all, the universe is a big place, and given the right conditions, sympathetic to *PRO*-1 creating some form of life.
Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze *PRO*-1 to explain why, *PRO* paleontologically speaking, "it is, indeed, a wonderful life *T*-2."

But no matter how much Japan gets under our skin *T*-1, we'll still have mom and apple pie.
On second thought, *PRO* make that just mom.
A Japanese apple called * *PRO*-2 the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way 0 Hondas did *?* on U.S. roads *T*-1.
By 1995 it will be planted *-1 more often than any other apple tree, according to a recent survey of six apple - industry sages by Washington State University horticulturist Robert Norton.
Some fruit visionaries say 0 the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.
It certainly won't get there on looks.
Compared to the Red Delicious, the exemplar of apple pulchritude, the Fuji is decidedly more dowdy--generally smaller, less - perfectly shaped, greenish, with tinges of red.
*PRO* To hear most U.S. growers tell it, we'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve.
But how sweet it is *T*-1.
It has more sugar "than any apple 0 we've ever tested *T*-1," says 0 *T*-2 Duane Greene, a University of Massachusetts pomologist, or apple scholar.
It has a long shelf life and "doesn't fool the public," says 0 *T*-2 Grady Auvil, an Orondo, Wash., grower who *T*-1 is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them.
"It doesn't look nice on the outside while *PRO*-1 getting mealy inside."
Mr. Auvil, *PRO*-1 razor sharp at 83, has picked and packed a zillion pecks of apples over the past 65 years.
He is known *-1 as the father of the U.S. - grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said 0 *T*-2 would never catch on.
It did *?*, *PRO*-1 shaking the apple establishment to its roots.
Now, even more radical changes seem *-1 afoot as the grand old maverick of American apples plays the role of Hiroshi Appleseed.
"The Fuji is going *-2 to be No. 1 0 *T*-3 to replace the Red Delicious," he says *T*-1.
The Delicious hegemony won't end anytime soon.
New apple trees grow slowly, and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom.
Its roots are patriotic--with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru, Iowa, *PRO* to be exact.
For more than 50 years, it has been the apple of our eye.
A good Delicious can indeed be delicious.
More than twice as many Red Delicious apples *ICH*-2 are grown *-1 as the Golden variety, America's No. 2 apple.
But the apple industry is ripe for change.
"Red Delicious has been overplanted *-1, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production," says *T*-2 Washington State's Mr. Norton.
The scare over Alar, a growth regulator that *T*-1 makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic, made consumers shy away from the Delicious, though they were less affected than the McIntosh.
The glut and consequent lower prices, combined with cancer fears, was a very serious blow to growers.
"A lot of growers won't be around in a few years," says *?* Mr. Norton, although they have stopped *-1 using Alar.
One may be William Broderick, a Sterling, Mass., grower.
"This is beautiful stuff," he says *T*-2, *PRO*-1 looking ruefully at big boxes of just - picked Red Delicious next to his barn.
"But I'm going *-1 to lose $50,000 to $60,000 *U* on it.
I'm going *-1 to have *-2 to get another job this year just *PRO*-1 to eat."
Besides rotten prices, he has been hit *-1 recently by hail, a bark - nibbling horde of mice, fungi and bugs.
Some 500 insects and 150 diseases *ICH*-2 wiggle, chew and romp through growers' nightmares, including maggots, mites, mildew, thrips, black rot and the flat - headed borer.
Even if a grower beats them back, his $2,000 *U* rented bees might buzz off to the neighbors' orchards instead of pollinating his, Mr. Broderick says 0 *T*-1.
Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by *PRO*-1 diversifying--into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease - resistant kinds like the Liberty.
"I've ripped out a lot of Delicious" and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says *T*-1 Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower, *PRO*-2 tramping through his 100 - acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently.
"I've got 70 kinds of apples.
Here's *T*-1 a Waltana," he exclaims *T*-3, *PRO*-2 picking one off a tree.
He bites it, scowls and throws it down . "
It's a real dog."
Supermarkets are getting into the variety act, too.
They still buy apples mainly for big, red good looks--that's why so many taste like woodchucks' punching bags *T*-1.
But freshness counts more than it once did *?*, and stores are expanding shelf space for unconventional, but tastier, and often pricier, apples.
"Rather than *PRO*-1 sell 39 - cents - a - pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79 - cents - a - pound Fujis," says *T*-2 Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.
The Fuji is a product of meticulous Japanese pomological engineering, which *T*-1 fostered it 50 years ago at a government research orchard.
Japanese researchers have bred dozens of strains of Fujis *PRO*-1 to hone its color, taste and shelf life.
Now the best of them age as gracefully as Grannies, the industry's gold standard for storability.
In the cornucopia of go - go apples, the Fuji's track record stands out: During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan's market.
"The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality," says *?* David Lane, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland, British Columbia, and so apples are more of a delicacy *ICH*-2 there than a big food commodity.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40% more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese.
The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S., *PRO*-1 sold *-2 mainly in fruit boutiques.
But in California, says 0 *?* Craig Ito, a Fuji - apple grower, "There's a Fuji apple cult.
Once somebody eats one, they get hooked *-1."
Mr. Auvil, the Washington grower, says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at $40 *U* a box if he had them.
(Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places, he adds 0 *T*-1.)
But his first crop won't be picked *-1 till next year.
"I expect *PRO*-2 to see the demand exceed supply for Fujis for the next 10 to 15 years," he adds *T*-1.
Washington Red Delicious, by the way, are wholesaling for less than $10 *U* a box these days.
Mr. Auvil sees Fujis, in part, as *PRO*-1 striking a blow against the perversion of U.S. apples by supermarkets.
"When the chain stores took over *T*-1, there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer.
A guy is sitting up in an office *PRO*-1 deciding what you're going *-3 to eat *T*-2."
After all, until the 1950s even the Red Delicious was a firm, delectable morsel.
Then, as growers bred them more for looks, and *PRO*-1 to satisfy supermarket chains' demands of long - term storage, the Red went into decline.
Now, those red applelike things 0 stores sell *T*-1 in summer are fruitbowl lovely, but usually not good eating.
They do deserve respect, however--they are almost a year *ICH*-1 old, probably equal to about 106 in human years.
The Fuji, *PRO* to be sure, has blemishes too.
It ripens later than most apples, and *PRO* growing it in U.S. areas with chilly autumns may be tricky.
Moreover, the frumpy Fuji must compete with an increasingly dolledup Delicious.
Mr. Broderick, the Massachusetts grower, says 0 the "big boss" at a supermarket chain even rejected his Red Delicious recently because they weren't waxed and brushed *-1 for extra shine.
And he hadn't used hormones, which many growers employ *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to elongate their Delicious apples for greater eye appeal.
Still, Mr. Auvil points out 0 *?*, Grannies became popular without big, red looks, so why not Fujis *?* *T*-2?
He sees a shift *ICH*-1 in American values--at least regarding apples--toward more emphasis on substance and less on glitz.
"Taste has finally come to the fore," he says *T*-1.
Or, for that matter, the core.
Oil imports to Japan rose 12% in September from year - earlier levels, according to statistics released * by the government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
The imports, totaling 98.5 million barrels, were 11% lower than August levels.
The year - on - year rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products, and partly because of tax changes in 1988 that *T*-1 left oil companies with high inventories in the late - summer / early - FALL PERIOD.
Imports of crude from the Middle East grew 17% from year - earlier levels, and Southeast Asian crude imports grew 43%.
While Mideast crude imports were higher compared with year - earlier levels, they fell 18% compared with August imports.
Southeast Asian crude imports, however, were 3.6% higher than August.
New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after *PRO*-1 shooting up the month before, *PRO*-1 reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models, the Commerce Department reported 0 *T*-2.
Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods expected * to last at least three years dipped 0.1% last month, to $126.68 billion *U*, after *PRO*-1 leaping 3.9% in August, the department said 0 *T*-2.
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August.
Moreover, a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl.
But many economists pointed to a 1.8% September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category.
That "suggests 0 the manufacturing sector is not falling apart," said 0 *T*-1 Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York.
She added, however: "It is not robust by any means."
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total, an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up.
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56%, and a government analyst said 0 nearly all areas *ICH*-2 saw increases, including airplanes, missiles, ships, tanks and communications equipment.
Orders for military goods usually catapult in September, government officials say 0 *?*, as the Pentagon scrambles *PRO*-2 to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted *-1 for seasonal fluctuations, a Commerce Department analyst said that the adjustment probably didn't factor out all of the wide - ranging surge in defense orders.
Without the increase in defense bookings, September orders would have plummeted 3.9%.
Analysts were most unsettled *-1 by evidence 0 the backlog of orders at factories is slipping.
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4% in September, to $476.14 billion *U*, after *PRO*-1 declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August.
In July unfilled orders grew 1%.
But analysts noted that excluding transportation - where what they believe *T*-1 was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures *T*-2 - order backlogs have declined for three months in a row.
"It means 0 we're eating into the bread that *T*-1 keeps us *PRO*-2 going.
That is a little disturbing," Ms. Kleinman said *T*-1.
"It also means 0 if you have a real drop - off in orders, production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less 0 *T*-1 to keep things *PRO*-2 going."
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row, *PRO*-1 posting a 5.6% drop after a 10.3% decline.
Such steep drops in a category seen * as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy.
But a Commerce Department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings, a category that *T*-1 is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year.
Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said: "If you look back a half - year or so the evidence *ICH*-2 was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital - goods sector.
Now at least there are question marks about that, and without any question the pace of growth has slowed.
"The Famous Teddy Z," which CBS Inc. had hoped 0 *T*-2 would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime - time schedule, isn't turning out *-3 to be the hit 0 the network envisaged *T*-1.
Although the half - hour situation comedy seen * Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time isn't a candidate for cancellation, it is slated *-1 for fine - tuning and by next week the network may announce 0 "Teddy Z" is moving to 8:30 p.m. from its 9:30 time slot, *PRO*-4 replacing "The People Next Door," which *T*-3 became the first network show 0 *T*-5 to be canceled *-2 this season.
"Teddy Z," which *T*-2 centers on a mailroom clerk - turned * *PRO*-5 agent at a Hollywood talent agency, was scheduled *-1 in the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot *-3 *PRO*-4 to follow "Murphy Brown," a situation comedy about a television news magazine, starring Candice Bergen.
"Teddy Z" was boosted *-1 by favorable reviews and a network - wide promotional tie - in contest with K mart Corp.
It was promoted *-1 on cable services, including MTV, Nick at Night and VH - 1, and premiered as the No. 22 - rated show for the week.
But five weeks after the premiere, the series has floundered.
In figures released * yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co . "Teddy Z," *PRO*-1 produced * by the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., was in 37th place.
Worse, every week it suffers audience drop - off from "Murphy Brown" and viewership on CBS picks up again once "Teddy Z" is over and is followed *T*-1 by "Designing Women."
"There is strong indication that ` Teddy Z' is not compatible with the shows 0 it is surrounding *T*-1," said *T*-2 John Sisk, senior vice president at J. Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC.
Last week, "Murphy Brown" was viewed *-1 by 14.1% of the available television households, while the number dropped to 12.6% for "Teddy Z" and rose to 14.2% for "Designing Women."
CBS executives said 0 the program is also slated *-1 *PRO*-2 to undergo some plot changes.
Creator Hugh Wilson, for example, included the lead character's Greek family in the cast, "but that is not the right focus anymore," said 0 *T*-1 one CBS executive.
Instead, CBS hopes 0 the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of *PRO* being an agent.
"We're making adjustments *ICH*-2 on the show, yes, but nothing radical," said *T*-1 Craig Nelson, the story consultant on "Teddy Z."
"But we hope *PRO*-1 to keep a balance between the office and the family."
The opening credits are being redone *-2, Mr. Nelson said 0 *?*, "*PRO* to make Teddy's situation clear to viewers who *T*-1 have not been with us since the beginning.
Those viewers find the show confusing.
Short interest in Nasdaq over - the - counter stocks rose 6% as of mid-October, its biggest jump since 6.3% last April.
The most recent OTC short interest statistics were compiled *-1 Oct. 13, the day 0 the Nasdaq composite index slid 3% and the New York Stock Exchange tumbled 7% *T*-2.
The coincidence might lead to the conclusion that short - sellers bet heavily on that day that OTC stocks would decline further.
As it happens, the Nasdaq composite did continue *-1 to fall for two days after the initial plunge.
However, the short interest figures reported * by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the National Association of Securities Dealers include only those trades completed, or settled, * by Oct. 13, rather than trades that *T*-2 occurred on that day, according to Gene Finn, chief economist for the NASD.
Generally, it *EXP*-1 takes five business days *PRO* to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary *PRO* to settle a trade.
The total short interest in Nasdaq stocks as of mid-October was 237.1 million shares, up from 223.7 million in September but well below the record level of 279 million shares established * in July 1987.
The sharp rise in OTC short interest compares with the 4.2% decline in short interest on the New York Stock Exchange and the 3% rise on the American Stock Exchange during the September - October period.
Generally, a short seller expects a fall in a stock's price and aims *PRO*-5 to profit by *PRO*-6 selling borrowed shares that *T*-3 are *-7 to be replaced *-1 later; the short seller hopes 0 the replacement shares bought * later will cost less than those that *T*-4 were sold *-2.
Short interest, which *T*-1 represents the number of shares borrowed and sold, but not yet replaced *, can be a bad - expectations barometer for many stocks.
Among 2,412 of the largest OTC issues, short interest rose to 196.8 million shares, from 185.7 million in 2,379 stocks in September.
Big stocks with large short interest gains as of Oct. 13 included First Executive, Intel, Campeau and LIN Broadcasting.
Short interest in First Executive, an insurance issue, rose 55% to 3.8 million.
Intel's short interest jumped 42%, while Campeau's increased 62%.
Intel makes semiconductors and Campeau operates department - store chains and is strained for cash.
Meritor Savings again had the dubious honor of *PRO* being the OTC stock with the biggest short interest position on Nasdaq.
Meritor has headed the list since May.
First Executive and troubled Valley National Corp. of Arizona were next in line.
Short selling isn't necessarily bad for the overall market.
Shorted shares must eventually be replaced *-1 through buying.
In addition, changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused *-1 by arbitrage.
For example, an investor may seek *PRO*-1 to profit during some takeover situations by *PRO*-2 buying stock in one company involved and shorting the stock of the other.
Two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge.
Short interest in the American depositary receipts of Jaguar, the target of both Ford Motor and General Motors, more than doubled.
Nasdaq stocks that *T*-1 showed a drop in short interest included Adobe Systems, Class A shares of Tele - Communications and takeover targets Lyphomed and Jerrico.
The NASD, which *T*-1 operates the Nasdaq computer system on which 5,200 OTC issues trade *T*-4, compiles short interest data in two categories: the approximately two - thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that *T*-2 trade on the National Market System; and the one - third, and generally smaller, Nasdaq stocks that *T*-3 aren't a part of the system.
Short interest in 1,327 non-NMS securities totaled 40.3 million shares, compared with almost 38 million shares in 1,310 issues in September.
The October short interest represents 1.04 days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period, compared with 0.94 day a month ago.
Among bigger OTC stocks, the figures represent 2.05 days of average daily volume, compared with 2.14 days in September.
The adjacent tables show the issues in which a short interest position of at least 50,000 shares existed as of Oct. 13 *T*-1 or in which there was a short position change of at least 25,000 shares since Sept. 15 *T*-2 (*PRO* see accompanying tables--WSJ Oct. 25, 1989).
David Shaffer was named *-1 to the new post of executive vice president of the Maxwell Macmillan group of this communications giant.
Mr. Shaffer takes primary responsibility for the electronic and technical - services group.
He had been group vice president of the electronic - publishing group.
Also, Sheldon Aboff, formerly a vice president at Maxwell, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 group vice president with responsibility for various electronic and publishing - group companies.
Safeway Stores Inc. reported a 69% decline in profit for the fiscal third quarter, but said 0 operating improvements were masked *-1 by unusual gains in the year - earlier period.
The Oakland grocery retailer, closely held * since a $4.2 billion *U* leveraged buy - out in 1986, said 0 profit for the three months ended Sept. 9 was $7.1 million *U*, compared with $23 million *U* a year earlier.
But it said 0 the year - earlier results included gains of $23.5 million *U* from divestitures.
Sales rose 4.2% to $3.31 billion *U* from $3.2 billion *U*.
For the nine months, the company said 0 profit fell 49% to $23.5 million *U* from $46 million *U* in the year - earlier quarter, which *T*-1 included divestiture - related gains of $50.6 million *U*.
Sales increased 5.5% to $9.81 billion *U* from $9.3 billion *U*.
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" may be visiting some new venues in the near future.
Judge Robert ("Maximum Bob") Potter sentenced Jim Bakker to 45 years in the big house yesterday, while a Beverly Hills judge tucked away Zsa Zsa Gabor for three days, plus 120 hours of work with homeless women.
Miss Gabor recanted her earlier - expressed fear of jailhouse lesbians.
Mr. Bakker said 0 he was guilty of sin but not fraud.
We can only wonder who *T*-1 will be the next lost soul chosen *PRO* to be America's Celebrity Convict.
Your Oct. 2 editorial "Reding, Wrighting & Erithmatic" on the recent "education summit" was like most pieces on the subject of education: It had little 0 *PRO* to say *T*-1.
Oddly, though, on the very same page you printed a comment that *T*-1 addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system.
Unfortunately, the comment was buried *-1 in another article, so it could not stand out in an education context.
In the Manager's Journal, Atsushi Kageyama, in *PRO*-3 commenting on many differences between American and Japanese culture, said, "Japanese children are raised *-1 in a way 0 many Americans would find *T*-2 severe.
After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood, they are exposed *-1 to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school."
What far too many people concerned about education either fail *-2 to understand *T*-1 or choose *PRO*-2 to ignore *T*-1 is that American children, on the whole, are among the most undisciplined in the world, *PRO* making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful.
Unless parents and educators alike start *-1 to develop more discipline in children, all the worthy concern, discussions and actions will not solve the problem.
Allen B. Richards Peterborough, N.H.
Roy E. Parrott, the company's president and chief operating officer since Sept. 1, was named *-1 to its board.
The appointment increased the number of directors to 10, three of whom *T*-1 are company employees.
Simpson is an auto parts maker.
Bank of Montreal said 0 it added 850 million Canadian dollars (US$725.8 million *U*) to its reserves against losses on Third World loans, *PRO*-2 bringing the total 0 it has set *T*-1 aside this year to C$1 billion *U*.
The bank said 0 the C$1 billion *U* in reserves will result in a charge of C$595 million *U* against earnings but said 0 it still expects *PRO*-1 to report a profit for the year ending Tuesday.
The bank reported net income of C$389 million *U* for the nine months ended July 31.
The bank said 0 the increase in loan - loss provisions won't affect the payment of dividends.
The bank said 0 reserves now amount to 61% of its total less - developed - country exposure.
Excluding Mexico, reserves equal 95% of LDC exposure.
In Toronto Stock Exchange trading, Bank of Montreal closed at C$33.25 *U*, up 87.5 Canadian cents.
The Bush administration said 0 it is submitting a "comprehensive" proposal for *PRO* overhauling agricultural trade that *T*-1 could help break an impasse in the current round of multilateral trade negotiations.
The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire *PRO* to scrap or reduce a host of trade - distorting subsidies on farm products.
But it would allow considerable flexibility in *PRO* determining how and when these goals would be achieved *-1 *T*-2.
The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by *PRO*-2 allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, *PRO*-3 together with existing tariffs, *T*-1 then would be phased *-3 out over 10 years.
Trade Representative Carla Hills, who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter *T*-1 unveiled the proposal, said 0 she is confident 0 it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners.
Mr. Yeutter, *PRO*-4 seeking *PRO*-5 to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that *T*-1 called for *PRO* eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year 2000, said 0 the new U.S. proposal wouldn't "put farmers out of business" but would only encourage them *PRO*-6 to "grow what the markets desire *T*-2 instead of what the government wants *T*-3."
The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, *PRO*-1 hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade *PRO*-2 to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.
Another U.S. proposal filed * Monday urges more "fair play" in services trade, including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.
Unlike the earlier U.S. farm - trade proposal which *T*-1 struck European countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.
For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear 0 there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas *PRO*-1 to cushion their farmers from foreign competition *T*-2.
It also says 0 countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.
Instead of *PRO*-1 proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did *?*, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.
Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints, and others with a "relatively minor trade impact" would be allowed *-1 to continue under certain conditions.
The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures 0 *PRO* to prevent countries from *PRO* using health and sanitation rules *PRO*-1 to impede trade arbitrarily *T*-2.
The goal would be *PRO* to resolve disputes such as one prompted * by the European Community's current attempt *PRO* to bar imports of beef from hormone - treated U.S. cattle.
The U.S. contends that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.
*PRO*-1 To encourage more competition among exporting countries, the U.S. is proposing that export subsidies, including tax incentives for exporters, be phased *-2 out in five years.
The Treasury plans *PRO*-1 to raise $1.8 billion *U* in new cash with the sale Monday of about $15.6 billion *U* in short - term bills *PRO* to redeem $13.81 billion *U* in maturing bills.
The offering will be divided *-1 evenly between 13 - week and 26 - week bills maturing Feb. 1, 1990, and May 3, 1990, respectively.
Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 *U* denominations, must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EST Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
The Treasury said 0 it will alter the auctions unless it has assurance of enactment of legislation 0 *PRO* to raise the statutory debt limit before the scheduled auctions Monday *T*-1.
Italy's unemployment rate rose to 12% of the labor force in July from 11.9% in April, and was up from 11.7% a year earlier, according to quarterly figures from the state statistical institute.
Istat said 0 a national survey during the first week of July showed 0 the number of job seekers was 2,888,000 up from 2,822,000 in April, and from 2,853,000 a year ago.
The unemployment rate was by far the highest in the southern, so - called Mezzogiorno region.
The southern unemployment rate rose to 21.3% in July from 21.2% in April and from 20.6% a year earlier.
Istat said 0 369,000 more people *ICH*-2 were employed *-1 in July than in April.
Westinghouse Electric Corp. said 0 it will buy Shaw - Walker Co.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Shaw - Walker, based * in Muskegon, Mich., makes metal files and desks, and seating and office systems furniture.
Sales of North American - built cars and trucks plunged 20.5% in mid-October from a year earlier, as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year.
"People are waiting for {new} factory giveaways," said *T*-2 Ben Kaye, sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn, Mass., whose sales *T*-1 are slow.
This trend appears *-2 to be especially true at General Motors Corp., which *T*-1 used both dealer and consumer incentives *PRO*-3 to ignite sales in August and September.
Since then, deliveries have slumped.
GM's car sales dropped 24.8% in mid-October to 69,980, while truck sales fell 26% to 37,860.
GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month, while other auto makers reported mixed results.
All of the Big Three suffered in the just - ended period, however, with sales of all domestically made cars, including those built * at Japanese - managed plants, falling 19% to 158,863 from a year earlier.
The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles, a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October, but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago.
Sales of domestically made trucks also continued *-1 to be sluggish in mid-October, *PRO*-1 dropping 22.8% to 94,543 from a year ago.
The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth - quarter production plans 10.4% below year - ago levels, but that may not be enough *PRO* to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales don't improve.
Industry analyst John H. Qualls, a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis, forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93 - day supply of cars at the end of the year, even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter.
Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2% drop in sales of domestic - made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2% drop in domestic trucks to 31,143.
The sales are being dragged *-1 down by a glut of 1989 vehicles, said 0 *T*-2 Joel Pitcoff, a Ford analyst.
The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of "scavengers" for bargain - basement 1989 cars, he said 0 *T*-1.
Town & Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C., still needs *-1 to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks.
Business had been fairly strong until Hurricane Hugo hit the area, but has been down since.
Chrysler Corp. also hit the rocks in mid-October.
The No. 3 U.S. auto maker had a 23.7% plunge in car sales to 22,336 and a 17.5% drop in truck sales *ICH*-2 to 22,925, which *T*-1 include its minivans and Jeeps.
Honda Motor Co., which *T*-1 continues *-2 to have short supplies of domestically made Accords, saw its sales of North American - built cars fall 14.1% to 8,355.
But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1% to 5,651.
A Nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales.
Toyota Motor Corp., which *T*-1 opened a plant in Georgetown, Ky., last year, saw sales triple to 6,256 vehicles.
a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported * in the period.
c - Domestic car
d - Percent change greater than 999%.
x - There were 9 selling days in the most recent period and 9 a year earlier.
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume.
This is in response to George Melloan's Business World column "The Housing Market Is a Bigger Mess Than You Think 0 *?*" (op - ed page, Sept. 26).
In Houston, we have seen how bad the housing problem can become *T*-1.
Unused houses deteriorate rapidly, *PRO* affecting the value of nearby homes; in a domino effect, the entire neighborhood can fall *PRO*-1 victim.
At this stage some people just "walk away" from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value *T*-1.
But most of them could have afforded *PRO*-1 to keep up their payments--they chose *PRO*-2 not to do so.
The problem is so vast that we need *-1 to try innovative solutions--in small - scale experiments.
Here are *T*-2 some ideas:
1) Foreclosed homes could be sold *-1 by the FHA for no down payment (the biggest obstacle to young buyers), but with personal liability for the mortgage (no *PRO* walking away by choice).
2) *PRO* Encourage long - term occupancy by *PRO*-1 forgiving one month's payment (off the tail end of the mortgage) for every six months paid *; or perhaps *PRO* have the down payment deferred *-2 to the end of the mortgage (balloon), but "forgiven" *-2 on a monthly pro-rata basis as long as the owner remains the occupant.
3) *PRO* Develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the renter.
An occupant will, in most every case, be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house.
In this way, the house is not dumped *-1 on to a glutted market.
John F. Merrill

The Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by "*PRO*-3 buying in" to their foreclosed properties (of which there are, alas, many *T*-1) at an inflated "balance due"--*PRO* say $80,000 *U* on a house worth $55,000 *U*--instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it's really worth *T*-2.
*PRO* Worse, the properties then sit around *PRO*-2 deteriorating for maybe a year or so, but are resold *-2 eventually (because of the attractiveness of the low down payment, etc .) to a marginal buyer who *T*-1 can't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs; and *PRO*-3 having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle repeats itself all over again.

The Polish rat will eat well this winter.
Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away.
Many a piglet won't be born *-1 as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop.
But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet *ICH*-1 for the private farmer than money in the bank.
Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands.
Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over.
In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat - hungry public and a new political calamity.
Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who *T*-1 brought them down.
In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, *PRO*-1 waiting for July's usual state - directed price rises.
The Communists froze prices instead.
The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops.
On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped.
Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded.
That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate *PRO* to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government *T*-1.
But by the time 0 Solidarity took office in September *T*-2, the damage was done *-1.
"Shortageflation," as economists have come *PRO*-1 to call it, had gone hyper.
The cost of *PRO* raising a pig kept *-1 bounding ahead of the return for *PRO* selling one.
The farmers stayed angry.
They still are *?*.
At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, *PRO*-1 hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them *PRO*-3 to sell *T*-2.
Here, they are searching for a higher price.
In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat.
"Of course it *EXP*-1's better *PRO* to sell private," he says *T*-2, as the butcher trundles away.
"Why should anybody want *PRO*-2 to sell to them *T*-1?"
The young farmer makes money on the few hogs 0 he sells *T*-1 here.
He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up.
"There's no feed," he says *T*-1.
"You can't buy anything nowadays.
I don't know why *?* *T*-1."
Edward Chojnowski does *?*.
His truck is parked *-1 across the field, in a row of grain sellers.
Like the others, it is loaded *-1 with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled * *PRO*-3 "Asbestos . *PRO* Made *-2 in U.S.S.R."
The farmer at the next truck shouts, "Wheat!
It's nice!
It won't be cheaper!
We sell direct!"
A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys.
"Country people breed pigs," says *T*-1 Mr. Chojnowski, *PRO*-2 leaning against the back of his truck.
"They can't buy feed from the state.
There isn't enough.
Some state middlemen come *PRO*-1 to buy from me.
I sell--a little.
I am waiting.
I have plenty more at home."
On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either.
At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted *T*-1 in.
A private market like this just isn't big enough *PRO* to absorb all that business.
The hulk of Stalinism, it seems 0 *?*, will not quickly crumble away.
State monopolies will keep on *-1 stifling trade, "free" prices or not, until something else replaces them.
Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution--plus a new manufacturing industry 0 *T*-1 to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed.
The Communists spent 40 years *PRO*-1 working *PRO*-2 to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here.
*PRO* Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started *T*-1.
But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset *ICH*-1 already: the private farmer.
"We are dealing with real entrepreneurs," says *T*-2 Antoni Leopold, an economist who *T*-1 advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot.
"There are a lot of them, and they have property."
Polish peasants, *PRO*-1 spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists.
Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy.
Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support.
As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail *T*-1.
Ownership, it seems 0 *?*, is the best fertilizer.
The Poles have had it all along.
Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land.
On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three - quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine - tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes.
Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation.
*PRO*-1 Try as they might *?*, the Communists could neither replace nor break him.
And they did try *?*.
A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms.
Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps.
He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets.
In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard *PRO*-1 eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic.
"It's bad soil," he says *T*-1.
Until 1963, it was good soil.
Then the state put in a reservoir *PRO*-1 to supply the area with drinking water.
Farmers lay down before the bulldozers.
Their protest was ignored *-1.
The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice.
Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows.
He expected as much.
In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir.
No phones.
No gas.
"We wanted them to build a road here," he says *T*-1.
"They started, and then abandoned it."
A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty.
"It's Russian.
Good for nothing.
Parts are a tragedy.
Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need *T*-1."
The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades.
In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward *PRO* making things 0 farmers want *T*-1; in the West, it is closer to 20%.
The few big state farms take first crack at what *T*-1 does get made *-2.
They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high - grade feed.
Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork.
"I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized *-1," Mr. Pyszkiewicz says *T*-2 as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun.
"We have one near here.
There is a lot of waste.
A private farmer never wastes anything."
The state quit *-1 shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago.
But it never did let up on the pressure.
Until recently, a farmer with no heir had *-1 to will the state his land *PRO*-1 to collect his pension.
The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state *T*-1.
His allotment of materials also did *?*, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain.
Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines.
When supplies are short *T*-1, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain.
A private farmer in Poland is free *PRO*-1 to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what *PRO* to grow *T*-2 and how *PRO* to grow it *T*-3.
He is free *PRO*-1 to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire.
He has plenty of freedom--but no choices.
"I'm on my own land," Mr. Pyszkiewicz says *T*-1.
"I don't have *-1 to listen to what anybody tells me *PRO*-3 to do *T*-2."
"Sometimes," says *?* his wife, "we're happy about that."
By *PRO*-1 starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland.
Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors.
Farm income is 15% below the average.
The young *ICH*-1 leave, especially girls who *T*-2 won't milk cows by hand.
Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow.
Without machines, good farms can't get bigger.
So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million.
Meat consumption is at 1979's level, pork production at 1973's, milk output at 1960's.
If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity.
The potential is displayed *-1 along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that *T*-2 trumpet their owners' wealth.
Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken.
Grain, milk and meat come next.
A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare *?*, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast.
Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale.
Solidarity wants it from the West.
Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: "The World Bank will be brought *-1 in *PRO*-1 to help us *PRO*-2 destroy the old system."
Felix Siemienas is destroying it now.
He packs pork.
A law *ICH*-1 went on the books in January that *T*-2 let him smoke bacon without *PRO*-3 breeding pigs.
He cashed in.
Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise.
"I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees," he says *T*-1.
He is in Warsaw *PRO*-1 to open a shop.
"I hire transportation, and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day.
I don't subsidize anyone.
Everyone around me lives well.
Yes, my prices are high.
If nobody buys, I bring my prices down.
That's the rule.
That's the market."
Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune--$10,000 *U* a month, he says 0 *T*-1.
He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window.
But the meat - processing machines 0 he picked *T*-1 up are 50 years old.
"I don't want expensive machines.
If the situation changes, I'll get stuck *-1 with them."
That's politics.
By *PRO* taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges, Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur.
Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support *T*-1.
It objected again in September when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister *T*-1.
Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers.
The Peasants can make a credible case *ICH*-1, against Solidarity, that hell - bent reform will drive millions from the land.
Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections.
But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction--from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager--will stay *PRO*-2 planted *-1 in the Polish countryside.
"We know how *PRO* to get from capitalism to socialism *T*-2," Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying *T*-1 one afternoon.
"We don't know how *PRO* to get from socialism to capitalism *T*-1."
He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places.
Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the "naczelnik."
"Many people in Poland hope 0 this government will break down," says *T*-2 Mr. Niciporuk, who *T*-1 belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity.
"That's what the naczelnik counts on *T*-1.
He is our most dangerous enemy.
Every time 0 he sees me *T*-1, he gets very nervous."
The farmer barges into the naczelnik's office.
A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper.
Mr. Niciporuk sits.
Anatol Pawlowski's leg begins *-1 jiggling beneath his desk.
"Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region," he says after a few pleasantries.
"They want *PRO*-1 to turn everything upside down in a week.
Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used * at the moment by a state farm.
He can't guarantee that he can use it any better."
"I am ready *ICH*-1 at any moment *PRO*-2 to compete with a state farm."
The naczelnik averts his eyes.
"What have you got *T*-1?
Not even a tractor.
And you want *PRO*-1 to make wicker baskets, too."
"I can do five things at once--*PRO*-1 to be a businessman."
"Big business," Mr. Pawlowski snorts *T*-1 in English.
The farmer stands *PRO*-1 to go.
The naczelnik stands, too.
"I care very much for this post," he says *T*-1.
"Eight years I've had it.
A cultural center *ICH*-2 has been built *-1, shops.
Suddenly, I am not a comfortable man for Solidarity.
I have accomplished too much.
They want *PRO*-1 to do more.
I wish them all the best!"
The farmer leaves.
And the naczelnik shuts his door.
Brush Wellman Inc. said 0 its board increased the number of shares of common stock 0 *T*-2 to be purchased *-1 under a previously authorized program to 3.9 million from 2.9 million.
The maker of engineered materials has acquired more than 2.7 million shares under the program.
Blue - chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines 0 they advertise in *T*-1, ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad "clutter" and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines.
Criticism from such big advertisers as Estee Lauder Inc., Colgate - Palmolive Co. and Seagram Co. put a damper on the euphoria at the American Magazine Conference here.
The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year.
"Magazines are not providing us in - depth information on circulation," said *T*-1 Edgar Bronfman Jr., president and chief operating officer of Seagram, in a panel discussion.
"How do readers feel *T*-1 about the magazine?
How deeply do they read it *T*-1?
Research doesn't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines 0 they subscribe to *T*-1."
Reuben Mark, chief executive of Colgate - Palmolive, said 0 advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines' audiences.
"We need research that *T*-1 convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader's lives, that readers are really involved *-2."
The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something 0 executives often are very proud of *T*-1: the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s.
Leonard Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder, said 0 consumer magazines are suffering from what he called *T*-3 *PRO*-4 "niche-itis," the increasing number of magazines that *T*-1 target the idosyncratic interests of readers.
"Niche-itis fragments our advertising dollars," said *T*-1 Mr. Lauder.
"We are being over - magazined *-1.
We are constantly faced *-2 with *PRO* deciding which partnerships {with magazines} we can keep *T*-1."
He added: "There's probably even a magazine for left - handed golfers...but the general interest magazine is something 0 we all miss *T*-1, and it should come back."
Mr. Lauder also attacked what he sees *T*-1 as the wide imitation of Elle, a fashion magazine published * by Diamandis Communications Inc., and criticized the practice of *PRO* stacking ads at the front of magazines.
"Readers don't want *PRO*-2 to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine," he said *T*-1.
Magazine editors did not take the criticisms *PRO*-1 lying down.
"We spend a fortune on research information," said Steve Burzon, publisher of Meredith Corp.'s Metropolitan Home.
And Tina Brown, editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s Vanity Fair, said 0 advertisers are frequently asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine *PRO* to relieve ad clutter.
"But advertisers wouldn't think of it," she said *T*-1.
Bernard Leser, president of Conde Nast, added: "Our research shows 0 we sell more of our heavier issues...because readers believe 0 they are getting more for what they pay for *T*-1.
Time Warner Inc. is considering a legal challenge to Tele - Communications Inc.'s plan *PRO* to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc., a move that *T*-1 could lead to all - out war between the cable industry's two most powerful players.
Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO*-2 to discourage other cable operators from *PRO*-3 joining Tele - Communications as investors in Showtime, cable - TV industry executives say 0 *T*-4.
Time officials declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Last week, Tele - Communications agreed *PRO*-2 to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million *U* for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary, which *T*-1 is a distant second to Time's Home Box Office in the delivery of pay - TV networks to cable subscribers.
Tele - Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said 0 it may seek other cable partners 0 *T*-1 to join in its investment.
Tele - Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships.
Earlier this year, Time even discussed *PRO*-2 bringing Tele - Communications in as an investor in HBO, executives at both companies said 0 *T*-1.
The purchase of the Showtime stake is "a direct slap in our face," said 0 *T*-1 one senior Time executive.
Time is expected *-1 to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York, where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion *U* antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with *PRO* monopolizing the pay - TV business and trying *PRO*-3 to crush competition from Showtime *T*-2.
Executives involved * in *PRO* plotting Time's defense say 0 it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele - Communications as defendants.
The executives say 0 Time may seek *PRO*-3 to break up the transaction after it is consummated *-1, or may seek constraints that *T*-2 would prevent Tele - Communications from *PRO*-4 dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime.
Viacom officials declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Jerome Kern, Tele - Communications' chief outside counsel, said 0 he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans.
But he said that any effort *ICH*-1 by Time *PRO* to characterize the Tele - Communications investment in Showtime as anti-competitive would be "the pot calling the kettle *PRO*-2 black."
"It *EXP*-3's hard *PRO* to see how an investment by the largest {cable operator} in the weaker of the two networks is anti-competitive *T*-4, when the stronger of the two networks is owned *-1 by the second largest" cable operator *T*-5, Mr. Kern said *T*-2.
In addition to *PRO* owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable - TV system serving about 5.6 million cable - TV subscribers.
Tele - Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million.
In its suit against Time, Viacom says 0 the ownership of both cable systems and cable - programming networks gives the company too much market power.
Time argues that in *PRO*-1 joining up with Tele - Communications, Viacom has potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks MTV, VH - 1 and Nick at Nite.
Ironically, Tele - Communications and Time have often worked closely in the cable business.
Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele - Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake.
But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained.
Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated.
Meanwhile, some legal observers say 0 the Tele - Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time.
Viacom accuses Time in its suit of *PRO*-1 refusing *PRO*-2 to carry Showtime or a service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.
But yesterday, Manhattan Cable announced 0 it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers.
Showtime has also accused HBO of *PRO*-1 locking up the lion's share of Hollywood's movies by *PRO*-2 signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios.
But Showtime has continued *-2 to sign new contracts with Hollywood studios, and yesterday announced 0 it will buy movies from Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., which *T*-1 currently has a non-exclusive arrangement with HBO.
The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases.
A related editorial appears today.
Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order *PRO*-2 to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed *-1 and judgment entered *-3.
Such orders can have a wide - ranging impact on third parties who *T*-1 do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others.
Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.
In order *PRO*-2 to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected *-1, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements *PRO*-2 to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions.
(It *EXP*-2 should be noted *-1 that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office .):
1 . As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.
The prosecutor must show that less - intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely *-1 to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction.
2 . In *PRO*-2 seeking approval of a TRO, the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the TRO would have *T*-1 on innocent third parties, balanced * against the government's need *PRO* to preserve the assets.
3 . In *PRO* deciding whether forfeiture (and, hence, a TRO) is appropriate, the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense; the government's policy is not *PRO* to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime *T*-1.
4 . When a RICO TRO is being sought *-1 *T*-5, the prosecutor is required, at the earliest appropriate time, *-2 *PRO*-7 to state publicly that the government's request for a TRO, and eventual forfeiture, is made *-3 in full recognition of the rights of third parties--that is *?*, in *PRO* requesting the TRO, the government will not seek *PRO*-6 to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant; will not seek through use of the relation - back doctrine *PRO*-6 to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred * to them; will not seek *PRO*-6 to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties; and will, in all other respects, assist the court in *PRO* ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected *-4, through *PRO* proceeding under {RICO} and otherwise.
The Division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time 0 the indictment is returned *-1 *T*-2 or, at the latest, at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO.
Mobil Corp. is preparing *PRO*-1 to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month, say 0 *T*-2 individuals familiar with the company's strategy.
The size of the cuts isn't known *-3, but they'll be centered *-1 in the exploration and production division, which *T*-2 is responsible for *PRO* locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas.
Employees haven't yet been notified *-1.
Sources said that meetings *PRO* to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled *-1 for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver.
This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil, which along with other oil producers and refiners *T*-1 reduced its work force by 15% to 20% *U* during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout.
Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil - producing operations.
In yesterday's third - quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a $40 million *U* provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations.
The report says that "the restructuring will take place over a two - year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations."
A company spokesman, reached * at his home last night, would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week.
Most oil companies, including Mobil, have been reporting lower third - quarter earnings, largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses.
Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output.
Yesterday, Mobil said 0 domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million *U* loss in the third quarter, while comparable foreign operations earned $234 million *U*.
Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year.
Daily output is expected *-1 to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year.
Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included *-1 in the earnings report before workers were notified *-2.
One Mobil executive said that the $40 million *U* charge related * to the action indicates 0 "a substantial" number of people will be involved *-1.
Some will likely be offered *-1 severance packages while others will be transferred *-2 to overseas operations.
Boston Co., the upper - crust financial services concern that *T*-2 was rocked *-1 by a management scandal late last year, has had a sharp drop in profitability--mainly because a high - risk bet on interest rates backfired.
Boston Co.'s fall from grace is bad news for its parent, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., which *T*-1 has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit's contributions in recent years.
In 1988, for example, Boston Co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $110 million *U*, while Shearson managed net income of just $96 million *U*.
Shearson doesn't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries.
But people familiar with Boston Co.'s performance say 0 the unit had profit of around $17 million *U* for the third quarter, after *PRO*-1 barely breaking even for the first six months.
Shearson, meanwhile, posted net income of $106 million *U* for the first nine months of the year, down slightly from $110 million *U* for the year - ago period.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. last week downgraded the long - term deposit rating of Boston Co.'s Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co. subsidiary, to single - A - 1 from double - A - 3, *PRO*-1 citing problems in the company's "aggressively managed securities portfolio."
John Kriz, a Moody's vice president, said 0 Boston Safe Deposit's performance has been hurt *-1 this year by a mismatch in the maturities of its assets and liabilities.
The mismatch exposed the company to a high degree of interest - rate risk, and when rates moved unfavorably *T*-1--*PRO* beginning late last year and continuing into this year--"it cost them," Mr. Kriz said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Kriz noted that Boston Safe Deposit "has taken some actions *PRO* to better control asset - liability management and improve controls in general, and we think 0 these will serve *PRO*-1 to improve credit quality."
As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested *-1, the problems ought *-2 to ease, he said 0 *T*-3.
But he also cited concerns over the company's mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market.
Boston Co. officials declined *PRO*-1 to comment on Moody's action or on the unit's financial performance this year--except *PRO*-1 to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters' results.
An accounting controversy at the end of last year forced Boston Co. *PRO*-1 to admit 0 it had overstated pretax profits by some $44 million *U*.
The resulting scandal led to the firing of James N. von Germeten as Boston Co.'s president and to the resignations of the company's chief financial officer and treasurer.
The executives were accused *-1 of *PRO*-1 improperly deferring expenses and *PRO*-1 booking revenue early, in an effort *PRO* to dress up results--and perhaps bolster performance - related bonuses.
Mr. von Germeten, in turn, attributed the controversy to judgmental errors by accountants and accused Shearson of *PRO*-1 conducting a "witch hunt."
Mr. Kriz of Moody's said 0 the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken * last year.
The company's current management found itself "locked *-1 into this," he said 0 *T*-2.
Boeing Co. said 0 Trans European Airways ordered a dozen 737 jetliners valued * at a total of about $450 million *U*.
The 300 and 400 series aircraft will be powered *-1 by engines jointly produced * by General Electric Co. and Snecma of France.
Currently, Boeing has a backlog of about $80 billion *U*, but production has been slowed *-1 by a strike of 55,000 machinists, which *T*-2 entered its 22nd day today.
Last week, a mediator failed *-2 to rekindle talks between the company and the strikers, who *T*-1 have rejected a pay raise offer of 10% over three years.
The stock market's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors.
Prices of long - term Treasury bonds moved inversely to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence 0 the economy is weakening.
But the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies.
The bond market got an early boost from the opening - hour sell - off in stocks.
That rout was triggered *-1 by UAL Corp.'s announcement *ICH*-2 late Monday that the proposed management - labor buy - out had collapsed.
The 80 - point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that *T*-1 saw investors shifting assets from stocks to Treasury bonds.
At its strongest, the Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond rose more than a point, or more than $10 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
As the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day, bond prices retreated.
But analysts said 0 the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly durable - goods orders and lackluster mid-October auto sales helped *PRO* prop up the Treasury market.
A slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend *-1 to bolster bond prices.
On the surface, the decline in September durable goods--only 0.1%--didn't appear *-1 very weak.
But orders for non-defense capital goods, a precursor of future plant and equipment spending, were off 5.6% after *PRO*-1 falling 10.3% in August.
Auto makers reported that mid-October sales were running at an annual rate of about 5.8 million units, far less than the 6.6 million units 0 analysts had expected *T*-1.
*PRO*-2 Taken *-1 together, the auto - sales and durable - goods reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is bogging down.
Although analysts don't expect the Federal Reserve to ease credit policy soon, reports like those yesterday help *PRO* build the case for lower rates.
Now bond investors are looking toward next week's report from national purchasing managers and the government's October employment report as *PRO*-1 potentially prompting the Fed *PRO*-2 to lower rates.
The stock market's precipitous drop frightened foreign investors, who *T*-1 quickly bid the dollar lower.
But as stock prices recovered some of the early losses, so did *T*-1 the U.S. currency.
Although dealers said 0 investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market's recent troubles and as the U.S. economy weakens, the dollar ended down only modestly.
In major market activity: Bond prices rose.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond gained nearly half a point, or about $5 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The yield on the issue slipped to 7.89%.
The dollar retreated.
In late New York trading the currency was quoted *-1 at 1.8355 marks and 141.45 yen, compared with 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen Monday.
The Justice Department is in the process of *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to gain control over a law that federal Judge David Sentelle recently called *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a "monster."
*PRO* Needless *PRO* to say *-1, he was talking about RICO.
With its recently revised guidelines for RICO, Justice makes it *EXP*-1 clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors.
The text of the "new policy" guidelines from the Criminal Division are reprinted *-1 nearby.
They strongly suggest that Justice's prosecutions of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken and Princeton / Newport violated notions of fundamental fairness.
Justice is attempting *PRO*-1 to avoid a replay of these tactics.
This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who *T*-1 was more inclined to *PRO* gathering scalps than *PRO* understanding markets.
The new guidelines limit the pretrial forfeitures of assets of RICOed defendants and their investors, clients, bankers and others.
This follows earlier new guidelines from the Tax Division prohibiting Princeton / Newport - like tax cases from *PRO* masquerading as RICO cases.
The forfeiture memo cited "considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process."
It told prosecutors *PRO*-1 not to seek forfeitures if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case *PRO*-1 not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime."
These changes come a tad late for Princeton / Newport, the first RICOed securities firm.
It was forced *-1 into liquidation before trial when investors yanked their funds *T*-2 after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture.
Princeton / Newport investors, including McKinsey & Co. and the Harvard endowment, made the rational decision *PRO* to withdraw their money; for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.
Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million *U* in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000 *U*.
The experience of Princeton / Newport and initiation of other RICO - forfeiture cases against legitimate businesses taught Drexel that a RICOed investment bank would be an ex-investment bank.
Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position *PRO* to dispute *T*-1" because of RICO.
Part of Drexel's plea was *PRO* to cut Mr. Milken loose.
So after all the prosecutorial hoopla no one has established what, if anything, Drexel did *T*-1 wrong.
So two cheers for the new rules.
Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to salvage RICO for real criminals.
But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able *PRO*-1 to supervise hyperactive prosecutors.
Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled * *PRO*-2, "RICO: The Monster That *T*-1 Ate Jurisprudence."
He said 0 ours is supposed *-1 to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO."
No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages.
What now for Princeton / Newport officials, Drexel and Mr. Milken?
Justice should review these cases *PRO*-1 to see what other prosecutorial abuses *T*-2 may have occurred.
We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name.
Murata Mfg. Co. said 0 it is establishing a subsidiary *ICH*-2 in Britain 0 *T*-1 to produce electric parts, including ceramic condensers.
The Tokyo maker of ceramic capacitors said 0 it purchased a plant in Plymouth.
The company didn't disclose a purchase price or capitalization figures.
Murata said, however, 0 it will invest about 1.4 billion yen ($9.9 million *U*) in the new company.
Production is slated *-1 *PRO*-2 to begin in April.
The company, which *T*-1 has a European foothold, Murata Europe Management G.m.b . H. in Germany, said 0 the latest venture is designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to meet demand for electric parts in European Community countries ahead of the creation of the unified market by the end of 1992.
Murata expects sales at the unit of about 1.5 billion yen in the first year.
When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart *PRO*-2 its artistic director last spring *T*-1, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.
Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that *T*-1 tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.
Trinity Rep meanwhile is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters, *PRO*-1 still hosting an annual "A Christmas Carol."
How would this bastion of traditional values fare in Ms. Bogart's iconoclastic hands *T*-1?
She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season.
It was a predictable revival of her prize - winning off - Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called * *PRO*-1 "No Plays, No Poetry."
Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois - bashing "Summerfolk," Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table.
Hers is a hand that *T*-1 will test the mettle of her audiences.
For Ms. Bogart, who *T*-1 initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends *-2 to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor--whether the text demands it or not.
And Gorky, *PRO*-2 considered *PRO* the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that *T*-1 easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques.
Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed * to *PRO* enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted * in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.
And "Summerfolk," *PRO*-1 penned * in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged * in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.
Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances.
Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky's time and place *PRO*-1 intact.
Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency *PRO* to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced * by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty.
But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that *T*-1 all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.
The director's attempt *PRO* to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that *T*-1 are unduly mannered.
Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it *EXP*-1 clear 0 they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads.
Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls, *PRO*-1 sprawling them on staircases, dangling them off tables, even hanging them from precipices while *PRO* having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring - do.
There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house (which *T*-1 looks like a parody of Frank Lloyd Wright and is designed *-2 by Victoria Petrovich) spout philosophic bon mots with the self - conscious rat - a - tat - tat pacing of "Laugh In *T*-3."
"Talk hurts from where it spurts *T*-2," one of them says *T*-1.
The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.
As for the humor that Gorky's text provides *T*-1, when *PRO* repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) *T*-2 it looks and sounds forced.
Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, *PRO*-1 to express herself through Gorky's helpless play *T*-2.
Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed *T*-1 *PRO*-3 Trinity's first - ever musical director and whom she equipped *T*-2 with a spanking new $60,000 *U* sound system and recording studio.
For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which *T*-1 is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view.
Like Brecht, and indeed Ezra Pound, Ms. Bogart has said that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt *PRO* to "make it new."
Indeed, during a recent post-production audience discussion, the director explained that her fondest artistic wish was *PRO* to find a way 0 *PRO* to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," *PRO*-1 surmounting the cliche *T*-2.
The danger that Ms. Bogart seems *-2 to be courting *T*-1 here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation, a vision so at odds with the playwright's that the two points of view nullify, rather than illuminate, each other.
Ms. Bogart's cast is part and parcel of the problem.
Ed Shea and Barbara Orson never find a real reason for their love affair as the foolish, idealistic young Vass and the tirelessly humanitarian doctor Maria Lvovna.
Cynthia Strickland as the long - suffering Varvara is a tiresome whiner, not the inspirational counterrevolutionary 0 Gorky intended *T*-1.
Better *PRO* to look in the corners for performances that *T*-1 inspire or amuse.
Janice Duclos, in addition to *PRO* possessing one of the evening's more impressive vocal instruments, brings an unsuspected comedic touch to her role of Olga, everybody's favorite mom.
Marni Rice plays the maid with so much edge as *PRO* to steal her two scenes.
But it is the Trinity Rep newcomer, Jonathan Fried (Zamislov, the paralegal) who *T*-1 is the actor 0 *PRO* to watch *T*-2, whether he is hamming it up while *PRO*-3 conducting the chamber musicians or seducing his neighbor's wife (Becca Lish) by *PRO*-3 licking her bosom.

BUELL INDUSTRIES Inc. halved its quarterly dividend to five cents a share, payable Nov. 17 to stock of record Nov. 3.
The company's quarterly dividend had been 10 cents a share since April 30, 1988.
Buell recently said 0 it would incur an aftertax charge of about $3.6 million *U* in its fourth quarter ending Tuesday, in connection with the sale and discontinuance of several lines at a plant.
The Waterbury, Conn., maker of industrial fasteners and metal stampings has 2.3 million shares outstanding.
If bluebloods won't pay high prices for racehorses anymore, who *T*-1 will *?*?
Breeders are betting on the common folk.
The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, a Lexington, Ky. - based trade group, has launched "seminars" for "potential investors" at race tracks around the country.
The group, which *T*-1 has held half a dozen seminars so far, also is considering promotional videos and perhaps a pitch to Wall Street investment bankers.
"People in this business have been insulated *-1," says *T*-2 Josh Pons, a horse breeder from Bel Air, Md.
"But the real future of this game is in a number of people owning a few horses."
At the Laurel race track, the breeders are romancing people like Tim Hulings, a beer packaging plant worker.
Right now, Mr. Hulings is waving his racing program, *PRO*-1 cheering for Karnak on the Nile, a sleek thoroughbred galloping down the home stretch.
Mr. Hulings gloats that he sold all his stocks a week before the market plummeted 190 points on Oct. 13, and he is using the money *PRO*-2 to help *PRO* buy a 45 - acre horse farm.
"*PRO* Just imagine how exciting that would be *T*-2 if that's your horse," he says *T*-1.
But experts caution that this isn't a game for anyone with a weak stomach or wallet.
"It's a big - risk business," warns *T*-1 Charles C. Mihalek, a Lexington attorney and former Kentucky state securities commissioner.
"You have *-1 to go into it *PRO*-2 firmly believing that it's the kind of investment where you can lose everything *T*-3."
And many have done just that.
*PRO* Consider Spendthrift Farm, a prominent Lexington horse farm that *T*-1 went public in 1983 but hit hard times and filed for bankruptcy - court protection last year.
A group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of Spendthrift, *PRO*-1 hoping *PRO*-2 to rebuild it.
Other investors have lost millions in partnerships that *T*-1 bought thoroughbred racehorses or stallion breeding rights.
One big problem has been the thoroughbred racehorse market.
From 1974 to 1984, prices for the best yearlings at the summer sales rose 918% to an average of $544,681 *U*.
Since then, prices have slumped, to an average of $395,374 *U* this summer.
But that's for the best horses, with most selling for much less--as little as $100 *U* for some pedestrian thoroughbreds.
Even while they move outside their traditional tony circle, racehorse owners still try *PRO*-1 to capitalize on the elan of the sport.
Glossy brochures circulated * at racetracks gush about the limelight of the winner's circle and high - society schmoozing.
One handout promises: "Pedigrees, parties, post times, parimutuels and pageantry."
"It's just a matter of *PRO* marketing and promoting ourselves," says *T*-1 Headley Bell, a fifth - generation horse breeder from Lexington.
Maybe it's not that simple.
For starters, racehorse buyers have *-1 to remember the basic problem of such ventures: These beasts don't come with warranties.
And for every champion, there are plenty of nags.
Katherine Voss, a veteran trainer at the Laurel, Md., track, offers neophytes a sobering tour of a horse barn, *PRO*-1 noting that only three of about a dozen horses have won sizable purses.
One brown two - year - old filly was wheezing from a cold, while another had splints on its legs, *PRO* keeping both animals from the racetrack.
"You can see the highs and lows of the business all under one roof," she tells the group *T*-1.
"There aren't too many winners."
Perhaps the biggest hurdle 0 owners face *T*-1 is *PRO* convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business.
Some badly managed partnerships have burned investors, sometimes after they received advice from industry "consultants."
So owners have developed a "code of ethics," *PRO*-1 outlining rules for consultants and agents, and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest.
But some are skeptical of the code's effectiveness.
"The industry is based *-1 on individual honesty," says *T*-3 Cap Hershey, a Lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who *T*-2 bought Spendthrift.
Despite the drop in prices for thoroughbreds, *PRO* owning one still isn't cheap.
At the low end, investors can spend $15,000 *U* or more *PRO*-1 to own a racehorse in partnership with others.
At a yearling sale, a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars.
But that means *PRO* paying the horse's maintenance; on average, it *EXP*-1 costs $25,000 *U* a year *PRO* to raise a horse.
For those looking for something between a minority stake and total ownership, the owners' group is considering a special sale where established horse breeders would sell a 50% stake in horses to newcomers *T*-1.
Retired Adm. William J. Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer of Schering - Plough Corp., were elected *-1 *PRO*-2 directors of this securities firm.
The board expanded to 17 seats.
From the Sept. 30 - Oct . 4 issue of The Economist:
What *T*-1 defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.
The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him; and it is a history 0 Israel is in danger of *PRO* repeating *T*-1.
Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded *-1 by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.
Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in *PRO* reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.
Like Lebanon, Israel is being remade *-1 by demography.
In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims.
Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority.
Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor, says 0 *?* its present prime minister, redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland.
By *PRO*-1 not choosing one of these options, Israelis will condemn themselves, as the Maronites did *?*, to perpetual war with the Muslims in their midst, and so to the internal erosion of their state.
Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut.
But that is not much of a consolation 0 *PRO* to draw *T*-1 from the failure of General Aoun.
Claude Bebear, chairman and chief executive officer, of Axa - Midi Assurances, pledged *PRO*-1 to retain employees and management of Farmers Group Inc., including Leo E. Denlea Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, if Axa succeeds in *PRO*-2 acquiring Farmers.
Mr. Bebear added that the French insurer would keep Farmers' headquarters in Los Angeles and "will not send French people 0 *T*-1 to run the company."
Axa would also maintain Farmers' relationships with the insurance exchanges that it manages *T*-1.
Mr. Bebear made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with reporters here yesterday as part of a tour in which he is trying *PRO*-1 to rally support in the U.S. for the proposed acquisition *T*-2.
The bid is part of Sir James Goldsmith's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC, the British tobacco, retailing, paper and financial - services giant that *T*-1 acquired Farmers last year for $5.2 billion *U*.
Axa has agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Farmers from Sir James's investment vehicle, Hoylake Investments Ltd., for $4.5 billion *U* plus a $1 billion *U* investment in Hoylake.
Any acquisition of Farmers needs the approval of insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers operates *T*-1, and Mr. Bebear's trip will take him to Idaho, Arizona and New York after his stay here; he will meet with insurance regulators, legislators, industry excutives and the press.
Hearings on Axa's acquisition application have been set *-1 for Nov. 13 in Idaho; Nov. 20 in Illinois; Nov. 24 and Dec. 4 in Arizona; Dec. 11 in Washington state; and Jan. 8 in Oregon.
Hearings haven't yet been set *-1 in Texas, Ohio and Kansas.
California's insurance commissioner doesn't hold hearings on acquisition applications.
Although Axa has been rebuffed *-3 by Farmers and hasn't had any meetings with management, Mr. Bebear nonetheless appears *-1 to be trying *PRO*-2 to woo the company's executives with promises of autonomy and new - found authority under Axa.
He said 0 Mr. Denlea would be a member of the top management team of the Axa - Midi group of companies, and would "help *PRO* define policies and strategies of the group."
Farmers was quick *ICH*-2 yesterday *PRO*-3 to point out the many negative aspects 0 it sees *T*-1 in *PRO* having Axa as its parent.
For one, Axa plans *PRO*-2 to do away with certain tax credits that *T*-1 have resulted in more than $600 million *U* paid * to the Farmers exchanges during the past few years *PRO* to offset underwriting losses.
Those credits result because of taxes that Farmers, as the management company, has paid *T*-2, and have "proved *-1 to be very important for the exchanges," a Farmers spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
Mr. Bebear contended that the tax cost to the exchanges under the revised structure would be about $8 million *U* a year, which he described *T*-1 as "peanuts.
People start their own businesses for many reasons.
But a chance *PRO* to fill out sales - tax records is rarely one of them.
Red tape is the bugaboo of small business.
Ironically, the person who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to run his or her own business is probably the active, results - oriented sort most likely *PRO* to hate *PRO*-3 meeting the rules and record - keeping demands of federal, state and local regulators.
Yet every business owner has *-1 to face the mound of forms and regulations--and often is the only one available *PRO* to tackle it.
There is hope of change.
Last week, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo .) held hearings on a bill 0 *T*-1 to strengthen an existing law designed *PRO* to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses.
"A great many federal regulations are meant *-1 for larger entities and don't really apply to small businesses," says *T*-2 Marian Jacob, a legislative aide to Sen. Wallop.
Other lawmakers are busy *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to revive the recently lapsed Paperwork Reduction Act, which many feel 0 *T*-3 benefited small enterprises.
Thus, optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape--just as soon as Uncle Sam gets around to *PRO*-1 arranging it.
Meanwhile, they tackle the mounds of paper--and fantasize about a dream world where bulk - mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished *-1 *T*-2.
*PRO*-3 To find out what red tape *T*-1 riles entrepreneurs most, the Journal asked a completely unscientific, random sample of business owners *PRO*-4 to fantasize about the forms and regulations 0 they would most like *T*-2 to get lost *-5 in the mail.
Some entrepreneurs say 0 the red tape 0 they most love *PRO*-2 to hate *T*-1 is red tape 0 they would also hate *PRO*-3 to lose *T*-4.
They concede that much of the government meddling that *T*-1 torments them is essential to the public good, and even to their own businesses.
Rules that *T*-1 set standards for products or govern business behavior, generally the best regarded form of red tape, "create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away," says 0 *T*-3 Sidney West, president of TechDesign International Inc., a Springfield, Va., business that *T*-2 designs telecommunication and other products.
Mr. West cites the Federal Communications Commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment: "They monitor product quality and prevent junk from *PRO*-1 flooding the market."
Some gripes about red tape are predictable: Architects complain about a host of building regulations, auto leasing companies about car insurance rules.
*PRO* Determining when handicapped access is required *-1 *T*-3 can be a nightmare for architects, says 0 *T*-2 Mark Dooling, president of Dooling & Co., a Newton, Mass., architectural firm.
There is such a maze *ICH*-2 of federal, state and local codes that "building inspectors are backing away from *PRO*-3 interpreting them," Mr. Dooling says 0 *T*-1.
Taxi, leasing and other companies that *T*-1 maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to *PRO* complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies.
"It's very costly and time - consuming," says *T*-1 Phil Rosen, a partner in Fleet & Leasing Management Inc., a Boston car - leasing company.
One senior executive at his firm spends nearly 20% of his time on insurance, he says 0 *T*-1.
Other forms of red tape are more pervasive.
The most onerous, many entrepreneurs say 0 *?*, is the record - keeping and filing required * by tax authorities.
*PRO* Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second.
But gripes run the gamut.
Here is *T*-2 the red tape that *T*-1 irks surveyed business owners the most:
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS:
Next to medical insurance, "costs of compliance" are the fastest - growing expense at Impco Inc., a Providence, R.I., chemical company.
Peter Gebhard, the company's owner, says 0 spending on regulatory paper work and the people 0 *T*-1 to do it--mostly 0 *PRO* to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws *T*-2--will rise almost 30% this year to $100,000 *U*.
Mr. Gebhard adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between 6.5% and 7.5% *U* of Impco's total operating expenses.
Eastern Reproduction Corp., a Waltham, Mass., maker of thin metal precision parts, must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire, police, hospital and plumbing authorities, says 0 *T*-1 Robert Maguire, president.
One state environmental regulator returned a report because "it wasn't heavy enough, it couldn't have been correct," Mr. Maguire says 0 *T*-1.
WITHHOLDING RULES:
Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $3,000 *U* within three days after payroll--or pay stiff penalties--and that's a big problem for small businesses.
It's especially nettlesome "if you're on the road and you're the one responsible," says 0 *T*-1 Eddie Brown, president of Brown Capital Management Inc., a Baltimore money - management firm.
EMPLOYEE MANUALS:
*PRO* Revising employee manuals on pensions, health care and other subjects costs over $25,000 *U* a year for Bert Giguiere, president of Professional Agricultural Management Inc., a Fresno, Calif., provider of business services to farmers.
An employer leaves itself *PRO*-2 open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals don't reflect the most recent laws, he says 0 *T*-1.
But the ever - changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that "you need professionals to help you; you can't do it yourself," he adds 0 *T*-1.
PENSION AND PROFIT - SHARING RULES:
*PRO* Complying with these is enough *PRO* to make business owners look forward to their own pension days.
Yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses *PRO*-1 to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans.
Alice Fixx, who *T*-1 runs her own public - relations concern in New York, says 0 she has had *-2 to overhaul her pension and profit - sharing plans three times in the past three years.
"It doesn't increase benefits, but it's costly and time - consuming," Ms. Fixx says *T*-1.
Compliance added 15% to 20% *U* to her accounting bill last year, she says 0 *T*-1.
SALES TAX RECORDS:
Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales--but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews.
*PRO*-1 To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties, these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they didn't pay sales tax *T*-2 was a legitimate business expense.
"You need one person 0 *T*-2 to just take care of sales tax," says *T*-1 Jennie Tong, executive vice president of Lee Liu & Tong Advertising Inc., New York.
Richard W. Lock, retired vice president and treasurer of Owens - Illinois Inc., was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this transportation industry supplier, *PRO* increasing its board to six members.
Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two "world - class" hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow.
U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S. - Soviet relations.
"This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress *T*-3," said *T*-2 Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who *T*-1 hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who *T*-1 attended the ceremony, called the undertaking *PRO*-2 a "historic step" in the evolution of U.S. - Soviet ties.
He added that it likely will have a "mulitiplier effect" in *PRO* stimulating further trade between the two countries.
The project will be the largest U.S. - backed joint venture 0 *T*-2 to be undertaken *-1 in the Soviet Union in recent years.
One of the hotels, 0 *T*-2 to be called *-1 *PRO*-3 the Sheraton Moscow, will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $75 million *U* *PRO* to build *?*.
The six - story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers.
It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants, according to a Sheraton announcement.
The hotel is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to open in 1992.
The second hotel, 0 *T*-3 to be called *-1 *PRO*-5 the Budapest Hotel, is *-4 to be constructed *-2 at a site even closer to Red Square.
Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined *-1.
Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels; Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share.
The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.
Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel, the Sheraton - Pan Am venture will be the first joint - venture hotels in the Soviet Union 0 *T*-1 to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.
U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that *T*-2 have been announced *-1 since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987.
But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that *T*-2 could be among the biggest ones 0 *T*-3 to be launched *-1.
Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., Archer - Daniels - Midland Co., and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known *PRO* to be considering such ventures.
Sheraton and Pan Am said 0 they are assured *-1 under the Soviet joint - venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture.
The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 *U* a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that *T*-2 can be traded *-1 in foreign exchange markets, according to a Sheraton executive.
Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said 0 the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements *ICH*-1 with Aeroflot *PRO* to jointly operate nonstop New York - Moscow flights.
He said 0 the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high - standard Moscow hotels.
Probably the most clear - cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar.
-- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty.
-- "Whether the installation is for early warning or space track, it clearly is not deployed *-1," the lawmakers said *T*-2.
"Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time."
The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members.
-- The Washington Post, Sept. 9, 1987.
-- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, by *PRO* giving American representatives a possibility *PRO* to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow, so as *PRO*-1 to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union.
-- Letter from Eduard Shevardnadze to U.N. Secretary - General Perez de Cuellar, reported * in Tass, June 10, 1988.
-- The construction of this station equal in size to the Egyptian pyramids constituted, I say it 0 *?* directly, a clear violation of ABM.
-- Eduard Shevardnadze, Oct. 23, 1989.
We're happy, we guess, *PRO*-1 to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.
Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede.
Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.
As it bids for new agreements, new loans and indeed admission to the civilized world, the Soviet government has recognized 0 it has a credibility problem.
So after 70 years, it is confessing the obvious, *PRO*-2 hoping *PRO*-3 to be believed *-1 about other things.
It's not enough.
If the Soviets want *PRO*-2 to be believed *-1, they need *-3 to start *-4 telling the truth about more than the totally obvious.
Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision *PRO* to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S. - Soviet relations--the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk.
The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.
The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power," though in general *PRO*-1 adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment.
It also was detailed *-1 in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that *T*-2 caused a significant number of deaths.
Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused *-1 by tainted meat.
We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance *ICH*-1 last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty.
And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms - control advocates who *T*-1 visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded *-3 by the assent to the tainted - meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who *T*-2 met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year.
The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made * from the bones of cattle that *T*-1 grazed on soil that *T*-2 was naturally infected with anthrax spores.
Harvard's Matthew Meselson--who we read 0 *T*-1 has sold something called * *PRO*-2 the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees--found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible."
We don't believe it.
And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve *PRO*-1 to have the West take their word for it.
Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms - control process itself.
The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing.
Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed *-1 vigorously enough by the U.S. government.
But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling.
The Soviets should be willing *PRO*-2 to set in motion a process that *T*-3 would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that *T*-1 would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.
Until that happens, glasnost cannot begin *-1 to deserve the kind of credibility 0 Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for *T*-2 with his confessions on Monday.
The Justice Department scrambled *PRO*-1 to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law.
The guidelines were distributed *-1 to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed *-1 for the first time by press reports this week.
They discourage prosecutors, under certain circumstances, from *PRO*-1 seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial.
But David Runkel, chief Justice Department spokesman, said 0 the guidelines "are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction."
Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white - collar defendants, as *PRO* opposed *-1 to alleged organized - crime figures, has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars.
Critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines 0 they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains.
In the new guidelines, the Justice Department says that in *PRO* attempting *PRO*-1 to freeze disputed assets before trial, "the government will not seek *PRO*-2 to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant" and "will not seek...*PRO*-2 to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred * to them."
The guidelines also state, "0 The government's policy is not *PRO* to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime *T*-1."
Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for *PRO* bringing a racketeering case *T*-1.
Mr. Runkel declined *PRO*-1 to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants.
"The impact, if there is any, will be impossible 0 *PRO* to judge *T*-2 ahead of time because the decision whether *PRO* to use {racketeering charges} is made *-1 in individual cases" by Justice Department officials in Washington, he said *T*-3.
In a memorandum describing the guidelines, Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts *PRO* to freeze defendants' assets pending racketeering prosecutions "have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press."
But Mr. Runkel said 0 the government isn't "backing off on these kinds of matters at all.
International Business Machines Corp. agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire a 15% stake in Paxus Corp., an Australian computer - software and information - services concern, for 20 million Australian dollars (US$17 million *U*).
The investment will be made *-1 through IBM Australia Ltd., a unit of IBM, the two companies said 0 *T*-2 yesterday.
IBM can raise its stake in Paxus to 20% over three years, but agreed *PRO*-1 to not go beyond 20% in that time.
Paxus said in a statement 0 it has several "well developed product and services relationships" with the U.S. computer company, and plans *PRO*-1 to expand these links.
The company earns about half its revenue overseas and plans further expansion.
A majority stake in Paxus currently held * by NZI Corp. will be diluted *-1 to slightly less than 50% after IBM acquires its interest.
The agreement requires approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and National Companies and Securities Commission, and from shareholders of Paxus.
Israel has launched a new effort *PRO* to prove 0 the Palestine Liberation Organization continues *-1 to practice terrorism, and thus *PRO* to persuade the U.S. *PRO*-2 to break off talks with the group.
U.S. officials, however, said 0 they aren't buying the Israeli argument.
Israeli counterterrorism officials provided the State Department with a 20 - page list of recent terrorist incidents 0 they attribute *T*-1 directly to forces controlled * by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
Mr. Arafat publicly renounced terrorism Dec. 15, *PRO*-1 satisfying the U.S. precondition for a direct "dialogue" with the PLO.
A U.S. counterterrorism official said 0 experts are studying the Israeli list.
"We have no independent evidence linking Fatah to any acts of terrorism since Dec. 15, 1988," he said *T*-3, *PRO*-2 referring to the specific PLO group that Mr. Arafat heads *T*-1.
"So far, this list doesn't change our view.
Israel wants *PRO*-1 to end the dialogue, but our analysts take a different view than theirs."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's top adviser on counterterrorism, Yigal Carmon, was here Monday *PRO*-1 to present the report to members of Congress, reporters and others.
Mr. Carmon said 0 he also presented the list last week to William Brown, U.S. Ambassador to Israel.
Separately, the New York Times reported that the Israeli government had provided its correspondent in Jerusalem with different documents that Israel said 0 *T*-1 prove 0 the PLO has been conducting terrorism from the occupied Arab territories.
The State Department said 0 it hasn't yet seen copies of those papers.
"If the dialogue was based *-1 on the assumption that Arafat or the PLO would stop terrorism, and we have evidence of continued terrorism, what *T*-2 would be the logical conclusion?" Mr. Carmon asked *T*-3.
Israel has long claimed 0 Mr. Arafat never meant *PRO*-1 to renounce terrorism, particularly because he and his lieutenants reserved the right *PRO* to press "armed struggle" against the Jewish state.
Now, Jerusalem says 0 it is backing up its contention with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked * to Mr. Arafat.
It blames most of these on Fatah.
The new accusations come at a delicate time in U.S. efforts *PRO* to bring about talks between Israel and Palestinian representatives.
The State Department said 0 it had received a new letter on the subject *ICH*-1 from Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, restating Israel's previous objection to *PRO* negotiating with any Palestinian tied * to the PLO.
*PRO* Deciding what *T*-1 constitutes "terrorism" can be a legalistic exercise.
The U.S. defines it as "premediated, politically motivated violence perpetrated * against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine state agents."
*PRO*-1 To meet the U.S. criteria, Israel contended 0 it only listed incidents that *T*-1968 involved civilians and occurred inside its pre-1967 borders.
At the heart of Israel's report is *T*-2 a list of a dozen incidents 0 Jerusalem attributes *T*-1 to Fatah, including the use of bombs and Molotov cocktails.
But U.S. officials say 0 they aren't satisfied 0 these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be offshoots of the intifadah, the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories, which the U.S. doesn't classify *T*-1 as terrorism.
In addition, the officials say 0 Israel hasn't presented convincing evidence 0 these acts were ordered *-1 by Fatah or by any group 0 Mr. Arafat controls *T*-2.
U.S. terrorism experts also say 0 they are highly uncertain about the veracity of the separate documents leaked * to the New York Times.
The papers, which Israel says 0 *T*-3 were discovered *-1 in Israeli - occupied Gaza, refer to terrorist acts 0 *T*-4 to be carried *-2 out in the name of a group called * *PRO*-5 "the Revolutionary Eagles."
Some supporters of Israel say 0 U.S. policy on Palestinian terrorism is colored *-1 by an intense desire *PRO* to maintain the dialogue with the PLO.
But State Department officials accuse Israel of *PRO*-2 leaking questionable claims *PRO*-1 to embarrass the U.S. .
Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites, the Office of Thrift Supervision said 0 *T*-1.
But that doesn't necessarily mean 0 thrifts are discriminating against blacks, the agency said 0 *T*-1.
The office, an arm of the Treasury, said 0 it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus *PRO* can't determine why blacks are rejected *-1 more often *T*-2.
Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill, where the information was released *-1 yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing *T*-2, lawmakers said 0 they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities.
They asked regulators *PRO*-1 to suggest new ways 0 *PRO* to force banks and thrifts *PRO*-3 to comply with anti-discrimination laws *T*-2.
Sen. Alan Dixon (D, Ill.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, "I'm not a statistician.
But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected *-2 twice as often as whites *T*-1--and in some cities, it is three and four times as often--I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem."
James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, "The data is a red flag, but *PRO*-1 lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread."
The trade group official added: "Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it."
Sen. Dixon held the hearing *PRO*-2 to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that *T*-1 required regulators *PRO*-3 to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending.
The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers, but that information won't be gathered *-1 in new studies for several months at least.
The Federal Reserve said 0 its studies in recent years, which *T*-1 adjust for income differences and other variables, showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages *ICH*-2 from banks and thrifts than whites.
But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee 0 the evidence is mixed and that the Fed's believes 0 the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating.
For instance, he noted 0 *?*, the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites.
Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said 0 they have been too busy *PRO*-1 handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years *PRO*-1 to put much energy into *PRO* investigating possible discrimination.
"We would be the first 0 *T*-2 to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years" to *PRO* developing examinations for discrimination, said *T*-1 Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
"If we've got folks out there who *T*-1 are being turned *-4 away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly," said *?* Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the banking committee, "then that is a matter that *T*-2 needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now."
Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said 0 they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws.
The FDIC said 0 it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices.
The comptroller's office said 0 it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987.
The comptroller's office also said that of 37,000 complaints 0 it received *T*-1 since January 1987, only 16 *T*-2 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending.
The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited *-1.
Thrift regulators didn't give any figures on their enforcement actions.
Mr. Fiechter said that among the possibilities being considered * by regulators *PRO*-3 to fight discrimination is *T*-2 the use of "testers"--government investigators who *T*-1 would pose as home buyers.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers *PRO*-1 to investigate discrimination in rental housing.
*PRO* Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions, but Mr. Grohl said 0 the U.S. League of Savings Institutions hadn't yet taken any position on the matter.
For the real estate industry, a watchword for the 1990s will be *PRO* buy, more than build.
That's the word expected * to be on the lips of the more than 3,000 developers, pension - fund advisers and real estate financiers slated *PRO* to attend a four - day conference, beginning here today, sponsored * by the Urban Land Institute.
The ULI is a non-profit research and education group based * in Washington, D.C., with 14,000 members nationwide.
With the market overbuilt, builders are finding limited opportunities and increased risks.
Developers and money managers are looking for bargains among the thousands of financially troubled properties around the country.
Real estate professionals now often bill themselves as "turnaround experts" and "workout specialists."
Conference attendees are expected *-1 to be buzzing about the workings of the recently formed Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency charged * with *PRO* disposing of an estimated $200 billion *U* of real estate dumped * in government hands by insolvent savings and loans.
Developers are also eyeing the real estate portfolios of major corporations.
Some plan *PRO*-1 to pursue foreign development ventures, mostly in Europe.
And other developers may shift from commercial to residential development in the U.S. .
"There aren't as many economically viable alternatives for real estate developers in this country as 10 years ago," says *T*-1 Charles Shaw, a Chicago - based real estate developer . "
So developers are saying 0 they will look into distressed properties.
They'll go into someone else's pasture as long as it's greener than the one 0 they're in *T*-1 now."
Developers are also forming more joint ventures with pension funds and insurance companies that *T*-1 can finance big projects.
The builders are more willing *PRO*-1 to give up some equity and rely on management and consulting fees *PRO*-2 to stay afloat in the soft market.
"Developers are teaming up with institutions *PRO*-1 often acting as project managers," says *T*-2 Smedes York, ULI president and president of York Properties Inc., of Raleigh, N.C.
"They are growing more pragmatic about their role."
Real estate firms are also using their alliances with financial institutions *PRO*-1 to amass acquisition funds.
"Why should you beat your brains out *PRO*-1 fighting the environmentalists, the neighborhood groups, dealing with traffic mitigation, sewers and fighting city hall *T*-2, then try *PRO*-1 to convince a lender *PRO*-4 to lend you money in an overbuilt market when you can get pension fund money, buy a portfolio, sell off pieces off it and play your own game?" says *T*-3 Jack Rodman, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Kenneth Leventhal Inc. a national accounting firm.
But experts say that when it comes to distressed properties *T*-1, *PRO* finding diamonds in the rough isn't easy.
The level of interest in the RTC's properties has been greater than *PRO* expected *-1, and has come from larger companies than *PRO* initially anticipated *-2, says 0 *T*-3 Stan Ross, Leventhal's co-managing partner.
And *PRO*-1 to succeed in the turnaround business, he says 0 *?*, developers may have *-1 to put in a lot of money and time.
*PRO* Finding pension funds and other sources willing *PRO* to invest is a high priority.
Quips *ICH*-1 David Shulman, director of real estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc.: "A theme of the Urban Land conference will be ` *PRO* take a pension fund manager to lunch.
Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed *-1 in the latest week.
The average yield on six - month CDs of $50,000 *U* and less slipped to 7.96% from 8.00%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based * here.
On one - year CDs of $50,000 *U* and less, the average slid to 8.02% from 8.06%.
Both issues are among the most popular with individual investors.
"Because of shrinkage in the economy, rates can be expected *-1 to decline over a one - year horizon," said *T*-2 Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.
"It *EXP*-1's unclear how much rates can fall *T*-2 and how soon."
Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months.
Interest rates generally began *-1 declining last spring after *PRO*-1 moving steadily upward for more than a year.
The average yield on small - denomination three - month CDs moved up two - hundredths of a percentage point in the latest week to 7.85%.
Long - term CDs declined just a fraction.
The average yield on both two - year CDs and five - year CDs was 7.98%.
Only CDs sold * by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week, *PRO*-1 reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold * at Monday's auction.
The average yield on six - month broker - sold CDs rose to 8.29% from 8.05% and on one - year CDs the average yield rose to 8.30% from 8.09%.
The brokerage firms, which *T*-1 negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell *T*-2, generally feel 0 they have *-3 to offer clients more than they can get *?* on T - bills or from banks and thrifts directly.
T - bills sold * at Monday's auction yielded 7.90% for six months and 7.77% for three months, up from 7.82% and 7.61%, respectively, the week before.
So - called jumbo CDs, typically in denominations of $90,000 *U* and up, also usually follow T - bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed * at small investors.
Some jumbos posted fractional changes in average yields *ICH*-1 this week, both up and down.
The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00% from 7.96%, while the two - year average fell by the same amount to 7.89%.
Six - month and oneyear yields were unchanged, on average.
"The (CD) market is unsettled right now," said *T*-1 Banxquote's Mr. Mehl.
"It's very easily influenced *-1 by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market."
The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks.
Some, however, lowered yields significantly.
At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, for example, the yield on a small denomination six - month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06%.
In California, Bank of America dropped the yield on both six - month and one - year "savings" CDs to 8.33% from 8.61%.
Yields on money - market deposits were unchanged at an average 6.96% for $50,000 *U* and less and down just a hundredth of a percentage point to 7.41% for jumbo deposits.
DISASTER STATES aren't jumping *PRO*-1 to raise taxes for relief and recovery.
Not yet, anyway.
Just after Hurricane Hugo battered South Carolina, some officials talked of *PRO* perhaps adding a penny to the state gasoline tax or *PRO* raising property taxes.
Gov. Campbell responded, "They're mentioning rope when there's been a hanging in the family *T*-1."
A spokesman says 0 the governor believes 0 he can avoid increases by *PRO*-1 relying on federal aid and shifting funds in state programs.
Still, Hugo's impact may revive unsuccessful proposals *PRO* to give local governments authority *PRO* to levy sales taxes.
A spokesman for North Carolina Gov. Martin says 0 Hugo hasn't prompted proposals for state or local increases.
California, where earthquake damage may top $5 billion *U* *T*-1, plans a special legislative session.
Property - tax relief is likely.
Legislators are talking about temporary rises in sales or gasoline taxes, although Gov. Deukmejian says 0 they should be a last resort.
Needs aren't clear, and the state constitution makes *PRO* increasing taxes and spending very difficult.
But some legislators think 0 the time may be ripe *PRO* to revise the constitution.
THE IRS WILL PAY if its error burdens you with bank charges.
Policy statement P - 5 - 39 sets out terms.
As a result of an erroneous IRS levy on a bank account, a taxpayer may incur administrative and overdraft charges.
If the IRS admits its error and the charges have been paid *-1, it will reimburse a taxpayer who *T*-2 hasn't refused *PRO*-3 to give timely answers to IRS inquiries or *T*-2 hasn't contributed to *PRO* continuing or compounding the error.
The IRS recently amended the policy *PRO*-1 to cover *PRO* stop - payment charges for checks lost * by the IRS.
If the IRS asks for *RNR*-1 and gets *RNR*-1 a replacement for a check that it concedes 0 it lost *T*-2 in processing, it will reimburse the taxpayer for the *PRO* stop - payment charge on the original.
Reimbursement claims must be filed *-1 with the IRS district or service - center director within a year after the expense accrues.
If the IRS seeks late - payment interest because of the lost check, you should request interest abatement, publisher Prentice Hall notes 0 *T*-1.
JUST FIVE ACRES MORE are all 0 we need *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to feel really at home, they say 0 *T*-3.
A couple 0 we'll call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 the Blandings spent nearly $800,000 *U* on a 15 - acre plot and main home and have an old $175,000 *U* mortgage exempt from the new limit on mortgage - interest deductions.
They plan *PRO*-1 to expand the home site by *PRO*-2 buying five adjoining acres for $200,000 *U*, borrowed * against a first mortgage on the five acres and also collateralized * by the 15 acres.
Their debt will be well under the $1 million *U* limit--on *PRO* borrowing *PRO*-2 to acquire, build, or improve a home--that *T*-1 qualifies for mortgage - interest deductions.
As you can guess, the Blandings want *PRO*-1 to deduct home - mortgage interest on the $200,000 *U* loan.
But, IRS private ruling 8940061 notes 0 *?*, no rule or court case bears directly on the issue of *PRO* adding land to a principal residence.
So the IRS has drawn a rationale from the sale of a home site split * in two and sold * in different years to the same buyer; a court let the seller in that old case treat this as the sale of one residence.
Thus, the IRS says 0 *?*, the Blandings' $200,000 *U* loan is home - acquisition debt, and interest on it is fully deductible.
EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS facing imminent filing and payment deadlines will get extensions and penalty waivers like those provided * for Hugo's victims; IRS Notice 89108 has details.

REPORTS OF PAYMENTS to independent contractors for services must be filed *-1 by businesses, but *PRO* don't bet that contractors' unreported income will be detected *-2 that way.

UH HUH:
A claim by Peter Testa of New York that a stranger paid him $500 *U* *PRO* to go into a bank and change $44,400 *U* in small bills into large bills "is unconvincing," the Tax Court found 0 *T*-1.
It held that Testa is taxable on $44,400 *U* of unreported income.
WHY *PRO* BE A MIDDLEMAN for charitable gifts *T*-1? a retiree asks *T*-2.
A retired electrical engineer 0 we'll call *T*-1 *PRO*-3 Ben works part - time as a consultant, but he doesn't want *PRO*-2 to earn so much that Social Security reduces his benefits.
So he has arranged for a university foundation to set up a scholarship fund for undergraduate engineering students.
He plans *PRO*-1 to tell clients *PRO*-2 to pay certain fees directly to the foundation instead of to him; he would omit those fees from income reported * on his return.
So he asked the IRS if the plan would work.
Well, notes 0 *?* IRS private ruling 8934014, "a fundamental principle" is that income must be taxed *-1 to whoever *T*-3 earns it.
The rule goes back at least as far as a 1930 Supreme Court decision, Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Hutton says 0 *T*-1.
If you assign your income to another, you still have controlled its disposition and enjoyed the fruits of your labor, even if indirectly.
Ben earns any fees sent * directly to charity and is taxable on them, the IRS says 0 *T*-1; of course, he also may take a charitable deduction for them.

The state attorney general's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms, *PRO*-1 charging them with responsibility for much of a $200 million *U* loss incurred * by the state treasurer's office in 1987.
The suit sets the firms' liability at more than $185 million *U*.
The firms are Morgan Stanley & Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., County Natwest Government Securities Inc., Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The firms have all said that West Virginia's suit is without merit.
On Friday, the firms filed a suit *ICH*-1 against West Virginia in New York state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability.
That suit is pending.
The suits relate to a $200 million *U* loss, disclosed * in December, that *T*-2 was suffered *-1 by West Virginia's consolidated investment pool.
The pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments.
In its suit, the attorney general's office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer's office *PRO*-2 to engage in high - volume, high - risk transactions that *T*-1 benefited the brokers.
Japan has climbed up from the ashes of World War II and a gross national product of about $800 *U* per capita *PRO*-1 to reach the heavyweight class among industrialized nations.
Now this remarkable economic growth seems *-1 to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern, democratic, "developed nation" mode of operation.
Until 1980, when Japan joined the $10,000 *U* per capita GNP club of the advanced countries *T*-1, it was a model developing nation.
The government built ports, bridges, highways, schools, hospitals and railways.
When industries were weak *T*-1, it protected them.
It gave the Japanese people a value system, based on the rationalization that given the country's lack of natural resources, they must work hard *PRO*-1 to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus.
Individual prosperity inevitably would result.
That system has worked.
The standard of living has increased steadily over the past 40 years; more than 90% of the people consider themselves middle class.
The people have given their leading and only credible political party, the Liberal Democratic Party, clear and uninterrupted power for those 40 years.
The LDP won by a landslide in the last election, in July 1986.
But less than two years later, the LDP started *-1 to crumble, and dissent rose to unprecedented heights.
The symptoms all point to one thing: Japan does not have a modern government.
Its government still wants *PRO*-1 to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat.
In a modern system, the government's role is *PRO* to give the people as much choice as possible and *PRO* to keep them well informed *-1 so they are capable of *PRO* making a choice.
It also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world.
The Japanese government doesn't allow this.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated * to *PRO* protecting the health of the people.
The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly does not act on behalf of students.
The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who *T*-1 spend so much time sitting in traffic.
The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers who *T*-1 must pay extraordinarily high prices.
And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself, *PRO*-2 supporting Japanese diplomats who *T*-1 sprinkle abundant aid money around the world *PRO*-3 to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's.
This ministry has done nothing 0 *T*-2 to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that *T*-1 are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image.
Instead, it seems *-1 to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict *PRO*-2 to expand its sphere of influence vis a vis other ministries.
All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a "provider" mentality; they do not serve the people, and particularly not consumers.
They serve the industries and the special - interest groups.
The rest of the world accepted such methods when Japan was developing *T*-1.
Japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing paychecks.
Japan is not a political country.
It is a bureaucratic country.
The Diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system.
Most bills are drafted *-1 by bureaucrats, not politicians.
The Diet doesn't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often *ICH*-3 opposed to whatever LDP does *T*-2 that it would be a waste of time.
So most bills are passed *-1 without full discussion; particularly difficult bills are passed *-2 in the absence of the opposition parties.
A recent example is the 3% consumption tax on all commercial activities.
This makes enormous sense in Japan, where direct tax accounts for more than 70% of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair *T*-1.
If you are a salaried man, Amen! 100% captured.
If you are a retailer, 50%, and a farmer, 30%.
*PRO*-1 To correct this inequality, most people would have favored an indirect tax, like the consumption tax.
But the bill was passed *-1 without debate in the Diet, in the absence of the opposition.
As a result, the Japanese people didn't know what *PRO* to expect *T*-2 when the new law was introduced *-1 on April 1 *T*-3.
They were frustrated *-1 by the longer queues at the cashier and the small coins given * as change.
All of a sudden, prices were no longer in denominations of 100 or 200.
They were 103 or 206.
Pockets exploded with one - yen coins.
While people were jingling their change, the LDP politicians were caught *-1 in scandals.
Money, such as in Recruit's political donations, and women, as in the cases of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno and Secretary General Tokuo Yamashita, seldom have caused political scandals in Japan.
Whereas most men were a bit ambivalent about the sex scandals (though they were furious about Recruit), women were upset about both and surged to the polls.
In the recent Upper House *RNR*-4 and Tokyo metropolitan congressional *RNR*-4 elections, in which the Socialist Party won a runaway victory *T*-1, 60% of all women *ICH*-3 voted, as *PRO* opposed *-2 to the usual 40%.
It *EXP*-1 is difficult *PRO* to analyze how much of their anger *T*-2 was due to Recruit, the sex scandals, or the one - yen coins in their purses, but they obviously were voting *PRO*-3 to punish the LDP.
*PRO*-2 Taken *-1 by surprise, the Socialist Party is busy *PRO*-2 changing its doctrines.
It *EXP*-2's now OK *PRO* to deal with the U.S., but not the Soviet Union.
Nuclear power plants are acceptable.
The U.S. - Japan Security Treaty can continue, sort of.
And so on.
Against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the Socialist Party the LDP has been paralyzed *-1.
Now is *T*-3 the time 0 *PRO* to reform the government from a provider, developing - country vanguard role to that of a modern, industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice *T*-1 *T*-2.
If the LDP, as *PRO* currently composed *-1, can't make the transformation, then it should split into two parties.
One party could stand for consumer interests, small government, free trade and globalism *PRO*-1 to put Japan clearly among the most developed and open countries.
The other party could continue on the traditional track of the LDP, *PRO*-1 representing the manufacturers' preference for larger government, control, regulation and protectionism.
The LDP must make a decision immediately; Lower House elections must take place before June.
In the current mood of the Japanese people, journalists and even some industrialists, *PRO* giving power to the Socialists might be good for the LDP, *PRO* cleansing it of past sins.
We must not forget, however, that such a humble political experiment could cause a global tidal wave of shocks in real - estate and financial markets.
At the most there is only nine months before the LDP fuse burns out.

The merger would create Scandinavia's seventh largest bank, with combined assets of 210 billion Norwegian kroner ($30.3 billion *U*).
The banks said 0 an application for a concession *PRO* to merge into one entity 0 *T*-3 to be called *-2 *PRO*-4 Den Norske Bank AS was sent *-1 Monday to the Finance Ministry.
The two boards said in a joint statement that the proposed merger agreement was considered *-1 in separate board meetings in Oslo Monday.
They said 0 the agreement will be submitted *-1 to their respective supervisory boards next Wednesday.
Extraordinary general meetings, 0 *T*-2 to be held *-1 Nov. 28, will decide the share exchange ratio.
The merger requires the approval of Norwegian authorities.
General Electric Co. executives and lawyers provided "misleading and false" information to the Pentagon in 1985 in an effort *PRO* to cover up "longstanding fraudulent" billing practices, federal prosecutors alleged 0 *T*-1 in legal briefs.
The government's startling allegations, filed * only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against GE in Philadelphia federal district court, challenge the motives and veracity of the nation's third - largest defense contractor.
In a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made * in the same court yesterday, GE asserted that "prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses, distorted documents and ignored important facts."
The company attacked the government's allegations as "reckless and baseless mudslinging," and said 0 its management "promptly and accurately reported" to the Pentagon all relevant information about billing practices.
The case strikes at the corporate image of GE, which *T*-1 provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic warfare equipment to highly classified design work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if Pentagon and Justice Department officials take a tough stance.
The company has been considered *-1 an industry leader in *PRO* advocating cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices.
But the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy *ICH*-1 over five years *PRO* to obscure from federal authorities the extent and details of "widespread" fraudulent billing practices.
The problems were uncovered *-1 during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division, which *T*-2 has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.
The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents *T*-1.
Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme *PRO* to defraud the Army of $21 million *U* on a logistics computer contract.
The company, for its part, maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney - client communications that *T*-1 shouldn't be turned *-2 over to prosecutors.
A hearing *ICH*-2 is scheduled *-1 on the issue today.
The government's 136 - page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985, when GE was accused *-1 of *PRO*-2 defrauding the Pentagon by *PRO*-3 illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts *T*-4.
GE pleaded *PRO*-3 guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million *U* in the Minuteman case, which *T*-1 involved some of the same individuals and operations that *T*-2 are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court.
In order *PRO*-1 to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible *ICH*-2 again for new contracts, prosecutors contend that "high - level GE executives" and company lawyers provided "misleading statements" to then - Air Force Secretary Verne Orr and other Pentagon officials during a series of meetings in 1985.
Overall, the government contends that GE's disclosure efforts largely were intended *-1 to "curry favor" with Pentagon officials without *PRO*-2 detailing the extent of the management lapses and allegedly pervasive billing irregularities uncovered * by company investigations.
Prosecutors depict a company that *T*-1 allegedly sat on damaging evidence of overcharges from 1983 to 1985, despite warnings from an internal auditor.
When GE finally disclosed the problems *T*-1, prosecutors contend that Mr. Orr "was erroneously informed *-2 that the {suspected} practices had only just been discovered" *-3 by GE management.
In its brief, the government asserted that it needs the internal GE documents *PRO*-1 to rebut anticipated efforts *ICH*-2 by GE during the trial *PRO* to demonstrate "its good corporate character."
GE, which *T*-1 was surprised by the last - minute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents, countered that senior GE managers didn't find out about questionable billing practices until 1985, and that the information was passed on quickly to Mr. Orr at his first meeting with company representatives.
Subsequent meetings, initiated * after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended *-2 from federal contracts, were held *-1 *PRO* to familiarize Mr. Orr with the company's self - policing procedures and to disclose additional information, according to GE.
GE's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity.
The company's conduct "does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent, ratification or cover - up," GE's brief asserts 0 *T*-1.
"On the contrary, it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters."
Mr. Orr couldn't be reached *-1 for comment yesterday.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted *PRO* to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks *PRO*-1 to go to the polls, *PRO*-3 unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices.
Twenty - five years later, the Voting Rights Act has been transformed *-1 by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed *PRO* to increase the number of blacks and other minorities--Hispanics, Asians and native Americans--holding elective office.
In the 1980s, the Justice Department and lower federal courts that *T*-1 enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments *PRO*-3 to create the maximum number of "safe" minority election districts--districts where minorities form between 65% and 80% *U* of the voting population *T*-2.
The program has even been called upon *-1 *PRO*-3 to create "safe" white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority *T*-2.
Although Section 2 of the act expressly disclaims *PRO* requiring that minorities win a proportional share of elective offices, few municipal and state government plans achieve preclearance by the Justice Department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they carve out as many solidly minority districts as possible.
The new goal of the Voting Rights Act--more minorities in political office--is laudable.
For the political process to work, all citizens, regardless of race, must feel represented.
One essential indicator that they are *?* is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency.
As *PRO* is *?*, blacks constitute 12% of the population, but fewer than 2% of elected leaders.
But racial gerrymandering is not the best way 0 *PRO* to accomplish that essential goal *T*-1.
It is a quick fix for a complex problem.
Far from *PRO* promoting a commonality of interests among black, white, Hispanic and other minority voters, *PRO* drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter's and the candidate's most important trait.
Such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person, and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one.
Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen *-1 in two cities--New York and Birmingham, Ala.
When they reapportion their districts after the 1990 census *T*-1, every other municipality and state in the country will face this issue.
New York City:
Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970, when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act *PRO*-2 to expand its reach beyond the Southern states *T*-1.
In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn *-1 *PRO* to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts.
This year, a commission appointed * by the mayor *PRO*-2 to revise New York's system of government completed a new charter, *PRO*-1 expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members.
Sometime in 1991, as soon as the 1990 census becomes available, a redistricting panel will redraw the City Council district lines.
The Charter Revision Commission has made it *EXP*-1 clear that in response to the expectations of the Justice Department and the commission's own commitment to *PRO* enhancing minority political leadership, the new district lines will be drawn *-2 *PRO* to maximize the number of solidly minority districts.
Blacks and Hispanics currently make up 38% of the city's population and hold only 25% of the seats on the council.
Several of the city's black leaders, including Democratic mayoral nominee David Dinkins, have spoken out for racial gerrymandering 0 *T*-1 to accord blacks and Hispanics "the fullest opportunity for representation."
In this connection, it *EXP*-3 is important *PRO* to note that several members of New York's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that *T*-2 bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations--Carolyn Maloney's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter's 25th district in Brooklyn, for example.
*PRO*-2 To win their seats on the council, these political leaders have had *-2 to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that *T*-1 would benefit all.
Often they have found that the relevant issue is not race, but rather housing, crime prevention or education.
Birmingham, Ala.:
The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of *PRO* carving out safe districts for racial minorities.
In Birmingham, which *T*-1 is 57% black, whites are the minority.
*PRO*-2 Insisting that they are protected *-1 by the Voting Rights Act, a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 *PRO*-2 to demand that the city abandon at - large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts, including four safe white districts.
The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented *-2, because in city - wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who *T*-1 catered to "black interests" could win.
No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority, but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that *T*-1 carves out three white - majority districts and six black - majority districts.
Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, lamented the consequences.
"In the past, people who *T*-1 had *-2 to run for office had *-3 to moderate their views because they couldn't afford *PRO*-4 to offend blacks or whites," he said *T*-5.
"Now you go to districts, you're likely *-2 to get candidates whose views *T*-1 are more extreme, white and black, on racial issues."
Two hundred years ago, critics of the new United States Constitution warned that the electoral districts for Congress were too large and encompassed too many different economic interests.
A small farmer and a seaport merchant could not be represented *-1 by the same spokesman, they said 0 *T*-2.
But James Madison refuted that argument in one of the most celebrated political treatises ever written *, No. 10 of the Federalist Papers.
Madison explained that a representative's duty was *PRO* to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good.
Large, heterogeneous election districts would encourage good government, said 0 *?* Madison, because a representative would be compelled *-2 *PRO*-3 to serve the interests of all his constituents and be servile to none.
Madison's noble and unifying vision of the representative still can guide us.
As long as we believe that all Americans, of every race and ethnic background, have common interests and can live together cooperatively, our political map should reflect our belief.
Racial gerrymandering--*PRO* creating separate black and white districts--says that we have discarded that belief in our ability *PRO* to live together and govern ourselves as one people.

Northeast Utilities raised its bid for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which *T*-1 is operating under Bankruptcy Code protection, to $2.25 billion *U* from $1.85 billion *U*.
Northeast's raised bid, which *T*-2 was supported *-1 by PS of New Hampshire's official shareholder committee, is a prelude to what *T*-3 is expected *-4 to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying *PRO* to acquire the company, the largest utility in New Hampshire.
The $2.25 billion *U* value claimed * by Northeast, based in Hartford, Conn., is the highest yet given * to a bid.
Some of the three other bidding groups are expected *-1 to increase their offers tomorrow, a date set * for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge.
A hearing is set *-1 for Nov. 15, but participants don't expect a resolution until July 1990.
Under the new Northeast Utilities plan, it would pay $1.65 billion *U* in cash to creditors and assume $100 million *U* in pollution control bonds.
Secured creditors would recover both principal and interest, while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued * before PS of New Hampshire filed for Bankruptcy Code protection in January
The biggest change in Northeast's offer was in improvements made * for equity holders who *T*-2 had been given *-1 short shrift previously.
*PRO*-3 Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which *T*-1 is completed *-2 but isn't yet operating, equity holders would receive up to $500 million *U* in cash, preferred stock and new 10 - year Seabrook bonds.
Northeast's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $165 million *U*.
In addition, Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited *-1 to 5.5% annually for seven years.
Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies.
Wilbur Ross, financial adviser to the equity holders said, "Given the state's strong bargaining position...we believe 0 the NU plan provides the best recovery available" to PS of New Hampshire's equity holders.
Officials of PS of New Hampshire couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
The company has filed an internal reorganization plan 0 it valued *T*-2 at $2.2 billion *U* that *T*-1 would require 5.5% rate increases.
That plan would leave existing preferred shareholders with at least a 41% stake and give common shareholders as little as 13%.
New England Electric System, Westborough, Mass., has proposed *PRO* buying the company for $2 billion *U* as part of a plan that *T*-1 would require rate increases of only 4.8% annually for seven years.
The state of New Hampshire has favored that plan.
The other bidder is United Illuminating Co., New Haven, Conn., with a bid valued * at $2.2 billion *U* and and a proposal for seven years of 5.5% rate increases.
California legislators, *PRO*-1 searching for ways 0 *PRO* to pay for the $4 billion to $6 billion *U* in damages from last week's earthquake *T*-2, are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing *PRO*-1 to spend *T*-3 *PRO*-2 to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.
The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion *U* in relief, but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled - back measure calling for $2.85 billion *U* in aid, the bulk of which *T*-1 would go to California, with an unspecified amount going to regions affected * by Hurricane Hugo.
That leaves the state *PRO*-1 roughly $2 billion to $4 billion *U* short.
A sales tax increase appears *-1 to be the fastest and easiest 0 *PRO* to raise funds in a hurry *T*-2.
According to the state department of finance, a one - penny increase in the state's six - cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion *U*.
Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed *PRO*-1 to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks.
California's so - called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from *PRO*-1 spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency.
Both Mr. Brown, the state's most influential legislator, and Gov. Deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase--should more money *ICH*-2 be needed *-1 than the state can raise *?* from existing sources and the federal government.
According to a spokesman, the governor is also studying the possibility of *PRO* raising state gasoline taxes.
Mr. Brown, meanwhile, believes 0 "only one tax will be feasible, and it will be a one - penny sales tax increase," said *T*-1 Chuck Dalldorf, an aide.
One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set * up by Gov. Deukmejian.
The fund has about $1 billion *U* and is set *-2 up *PRO*-3 to handle "precisely the kind of emergency" 0 the state faces *T*-1, said 0 *T*-4 Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary.
But the fund's size is disputed *-1 by Mr. Brown's office, which *T*-2 estimates 0 the fund holds from $630 million to $800 million *U*.
Moreover, an aide to Mr. Brown said 0 Gov. Deukmejian "has expressed a desire *PRO* not to spend all the reserve on this."
*PRO*-1 To push through a sales tax increase, however, the state will have *-1 to suspend the Gann limit, *PRO*-2 citing an emergency.
And then it will be required *-1 *PRO*-3 to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three - year period after the temporary tax increase ends, said 0 *T*-2 Cindy Katz, assistant director of the state department of finance.
A sales tax increase would require two - thirds approval in both houses of the state's legislature.
But observers expect broad support.
"If there's an emergency and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think 0 the attitude will be supportive," said *T*-1 Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce.
But others think 0 property owners ought *-1 to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.
Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known * as Proposition 13.
The state could also increase gasoline taxes; every one penny increase in the tax would yield $11 million *U* a month.
But Gov. Deukmejian and others are reluctant *PRO*-1 to do anything 0 *T*-2 to harm the state's chances of *PRO* sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis.
*PRO* To raise more highway funds, a measure 0 *T*-1 to double the state's nine - cent a gallon tax over five years is set *PRO*-2 to appear on the state's June election ballot.
But some fear 0 *PRO* imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure.
Not everyone is convinced 0 the state must raise new revenue *PRO*-1 to meet its earthquake needs.
"It *EXP*-1's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help, said *T*-2 Quentin Kopp, chairman of the state senate's transportation committee.
Separately, two men injured * in last week's earthquake - triggered freeway collapse in Oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately heeded warnings about the structure's safety.
The claims, which *T*-1 were filed *-2 with the State Board of Control but will probably end up in court, are the first arising out of the collapse of the so - called Cypress structure viaduct.
The men can defeat immunities that states often assert *T*-1 in court by *PRO*-2 showing that officials knew *RNR*-3 or should have known *RNR*-3 that design of the structure was defective and that they failed *-4 to make reasonable changes.
A Board of Control spokesman said 0 the board had not seen the claim and declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
International Minerals & Chemical Corp. said 0 it agreed definitively *PRO*-1 to sell its international fragrance business to Bayer AG of West Germany.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The maker of animal health and nutrition products said 0 the business, Creations Aromatiques of Port Valais, Switzerland, and Woodside, N.Y., is a division of its Mallinckrodt Inc. subsidiary and had sales of about $30 million *U* for its most recent year.
International Minerals said 0 the sale will allow Mallinckrodt to focus its resources on its core businesses of medical products, specialty chemicals and flavors.
*PRO* Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake--especially if you don't understand what you're investing in *T*-1.
*PRO* Just ask Richard Blumenfeld, a New Jersey dentist who *T*-1 considers himself "a reasonably sophisticated investor."
In May 1986, Dr. Blumenfeld gave Merrill Lynch & Co. about $40,000 *U* for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9%.
"It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly *T*-1," Dr. Blumenfeld recalls *T*-2.
Yields on five - year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%, and 10 - year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%.
The CD seemed like a great deal.
But nearly 3 1/2 years later, Merrill says 0 the investment is worth about $43,000 *U*--an amount that *T*-1 represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000 *U*.
The problem is that the CD 0 he bought *T*-1 for a retirement plan wasn't a plain vanilla CD.
Instead, his Merrill broker put him in a zero - coupon CD, which *T*-2 is sold *-1 at a deep discount to its face value.
The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor's return.
More important, the CD was purchased *-1 on the secondary, or resale, market.
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued *-1 in 1984 *T*-4, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then, part of the price 0 Dr. Blumenfeld paid *T*-3 was a premium--an additional amount on top of the CD's base value plus accrued interest that *T*-2 represented the CD's increased market value.
Now the thrift that *T*-1 issued the CD is insolvent, and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance.
The tip - off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's "estimated current market value" had plummeted by $9,000 *U* in a month *T*-1.
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker's office later, the dentist found out that the $9,000 *U* drop represented the current value of the premium 0 he paid *T*-1 when he bought the CD *T*-2, and that the amount wasn't insured *-3.
"This is one thing 0 I was never aware of *T*-1," he says *T*-2.
He assumed that principal and interest were "fully insured *-1 up to $100,000 *U*," he adds *T*-2.
Dr. Blumenfeld isn't unique.
Especially at times like these, when declining rates make it *EXP*-1 hard for investors to get yields 0 they have come *PRO*-3 to expect *T*-2 *T*-5, too many people chase the promise of above - market returns without *PRO*-4 fully appreciating the risk.
"Yield greed often gets in the way of *PRO* understanding things," says *T*-1 John Markese, research director of the American Association of Individual Investors, a Chicago - based educational group.
"The biggest problem 0 we have *T*-1 is that investors realize, after the fact, that they didn't understand what they were investing in *T*-2."
Dr. Blumenfeld concedes 0 he didn't fully understand what he was buying *T*-1.
He says that he knew 0 he was getting a zero - coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero - coupon Treasury security sold * by Merrill Lynch.
But he says 0 he didn't understand 0 he was buying the CD on the secondary market, and he contends 0 his broker never fully explained the risks.
The broker, Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch's Morristown, N.J., office, refuses *PRO*-1 to discuss the matter with a reporter, *PRO*-1 referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York.
Those officials say 0 there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent * to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale.
The fact sheet, dated * April 1986, says on page three: "If the price paid * for a CD purchased * in the secondary market...is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero - coupon CDs, the difference...is not insured *-1....
Computations involving zero - coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions 0 you may have *T*-1 with your financial consultant."
Dr. Blumenfeld says 0 he doesn't remember the paragraph about premiums in the fact sheet 0 he received *T*-2 and didn't realize 0 part of what he paid *T*-1 was a premium.
"I assumed 0 I was buying a CD as a CD," he says *T*-1.
Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that *T*-2 issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated *-1 and the CD terminated *-4, the brokerage firm would cover the premium 0 Dr. Blumenfeld paid *T*-3.
(Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued * to the date of liquidation, to a maximum of $100,000 *U*.)
"It's not a blanket commitment, it's a case - by - case situation," says *T*-1 Albert Disposti, a managing director of Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc.
"There's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware" of the risks.
"We weren't sure that full disclosure, as we wanted it, was being made *-1."
Merrill Lynch says 0 it *EXP*-1's impossible *PRO* to estimate how many investors *T*-2 are in Dr. Blumenfeld's situation, although it says 0 the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years.
Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells *T*-1, which it didn't provide *T*-2 in 1986.
Zero - coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion - plus *U* in CDs outstanding, and those purchased * on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total.
Merrill Lynch estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero - coupon CDs.
Still, there are several billion dollars of zero - coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding.
Because of the tax consequences of zero - coupon investments--income tax is payable in the year 0 interest is accrued *-1 *T*-2, although interest isn't actually paid *-3 until maturity--zero - coupon CDs are usually sold for tax - advantaged accounts *PRO*-4 to finance things like retirement and children's education.
Most zero - coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years, and they usually double in value by maturity.
But investors who *T*-1 bought zero - coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who *T*-2 may be surprised *PRO*-3 to learn 0 the full amount of their investments isn't insured *-4.
People who *T*-1 paid a premium for standard CDs purchased * on the secondary market could also find that those premiums aren't insured *-3 if the institutions that *T*-2 issued the CDs failed.
However, those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero - coupon CDs, and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid *-3 *T*-1.
Whatever the case, a Merrill Lynch spokesman emphasizes 0 *?*, investors shouldn't have *-4 to worry about the uninsured premium issue, unless the bank or thrift that *T*-2 issued the CD is closed *-1 and its deposits paid *-5 off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate.
Dr. Blumenfeld says 0 he's satisfied that his problem has been resolved *-1.
And he says 0 he's learned a lesson: "You always have *-1 to watch out for yourself.
No one else will watch out for you.
After *PRO*-2 being whipsawed *-1 by a volatile stock market, Treasury bonds closed higher.
But junk bonds took more hits.
Early in the day, bond dealers said 0 trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled *PRO*-1 to buy long - term Treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market's volatility would lead to a "flight - to - quality" rally.
That happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys, which *T*-1 are higher in quality and thus considered *PRO*-2 safe *T*-3.
"Some retail accounts, such as commercial banks and pension funds, wanted *PRO*-1 to get on the bandwagon before it was too late," said *T*-2 Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis.
At one point, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided *PRO*-1 to remain independent.
In response, Treasury prices soared 1 1/8 points, or about $11.25 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
But the gains in Treasury bonds were pared *-1 as stocks staged a partial recovery.
The industrial average ended at 2659.22, down 3.69 points.
Economists said 0 the bond market's strength also is a sign that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing.
While they don't expect the Fed to move right away, they say 0 the case for lower rates is building.
Yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1%, while the nation's auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales.
The Treasury's 30 - year bond ended over 1/4 point higher.
Municipal, mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose 1/8 to 1/2 point.
But high - yield, high - risk bonds fell 1/4 to 1/2 point with the stock market early in the session and never recovered.
According to a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued * by RJR Holdings Capital Corp., which *T*-1 are the easiest *PRO* to sell.
RJR's 14.70% bonds due 2007 fell 2 1/2 points.
Trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers couldn't find enough buyers 0 *T*-1 to match sellers.
"While the stock market was falling, most {junk bond holders} were just watching it *PRO*-2 not knowing what *PRO*-3 to do *T*-1," said *T*-4 Paul Suckow, director of fixed - income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp.
"It was like *PRO* driving down the highway *PRO*-1 watching a wreck.
Everybody was rubber - necking."
Adding to the junk market's jitters were *T*-3 reports that Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. is having trouble *-2 structuring a $1.6 billion *U* offering for TW Food Services Inc. and will postpone *RNR*-1 or even cancel *RNR*-1 the issue.
TW is the largest franchisee of Hardee's, a fast - food restaurant, and operates several other food chains.
Donaldson Lufkin wouldn't comment.
Credit analysts said 0 investors are nervous about the issue because they say 0 the company's ability *PRO* to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables, including the sale of assets and the need *PRO* to mortgage property *PRO*-1 to retire some existing debt.
Also, the TW offering includes interest - deferred and *PRO* pay - in - kind securities, which *T*-1 are currently unpopular.
Meanwhile, investors turned a cold shoulder to the Treasury's sale of $10 billion *U* of new two - year notes yesterday.
"It *EXP*-2's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy, *PRO* given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks," said *T*-1 Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd.
"People are looking past supply to lower interest rates, but they're also worried about *PRO*-2 being whipsawed *-1 by the volatility in the stock market."
The new two - year notes were priced *-1 with an average yield of 7.74%.
That was higher than the 7.71% to 7.73% average yield that traders had expected *T*-1.
In when - issued trading, the notes were quoted *-1 at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.78%.
Sluggish demand was also evidenced *-1 by the weak 2.41 - to - 1 bid - to - cover ratio, which *T*-2 was lower than the average 2.79 - to - 1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions.
The ratio, which *T*-1 reflects the number of bids 0 the Treasury receives *T*-2 for each bid accepted *, is used *-3 *PRO* to gauge investor demand.
Dealers said 0 players shied away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery, which, in fact, *T*-1 did happen.
Individual and Japanese participation in the auction was disappointing, according to dealers.
"Interest by Japanese investors was limited," said *T*-2 Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
"They are typically not active in two - year note auctions, but today's participation could be viewed *-1 as lighter - than - normal."
However, Mr. Moran added that the Japanese generally have a positive view of the U.S. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline.
He said, "Possibly, they're waiting *PRO*-2 to buy at the (quarterly) refunding" of government debt 0 *T*-3 to be held *-1 next month by the Treasury.
A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10% of the two - year notes.
Treasury, Agency Securities
Today investors will focus on the long - awaited auction of $4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds by Resolution Funding Corp.
The initial bond offering by the new government agency, which *T*-1 was created *-2 *PRO* to help rescue the nation's troubled thrifts, isn't expected *-3 to see robust demand.
A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers' efforts *PRO* to drum up interest in the so - called bailout bonds.
In when - issued trading, the Refcorp bonds were quoted *-1 at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 8.17%.
Yesterday, the benchmark 30 - year bond was quoted *-1 late at 102 18/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.89%, compared with 102 9/32 0 *T*-3 to yield 7.93% on Monday.
The latest 10 - year Treasury was quoted *-1 at 100 22/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.88%, compared with 100 17/32 0 *T*-3 to yield 7.9%.
Short - term rates were unchanged to slightly lower.
The discount rate on three - month Treasury bills was quoted *-1 at 7.52% for a bond - equivalent yield of 7.75%, while the rate on six - month Treasury bills was quoted *-2 at 7.47% for a yield of 7.85%.
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
Corporate Issues
Several blue - chip companies tapped the new - issue market yesterday *PRO*-1 to take advantage of falling interest rates.
Three of the largest offerings, by Exxon Capital Corp., Xerox Corp. and Citicorp, were underwritten *-1 by groups led * by Salomon Brothers Inc.
Exxon Capital, long - rumored *PRO* to be a potential debt issuer, offered $200 million *U* of 10 - year notes priced * *PRO*-2 to yield 8.31%.
Citicorp issued $200 million *U* of seven - year notes priced * *PRO*-1 to yield 8.82%, and Xerox priced $150 million *U* of six - year notes *PRO*-2 to yield 8.85%.
Meanwhile, International Business Machines Corp. paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by *PRO*-1 filing a shelf registration *ICH*-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $800 million *U* in new debt.
This is in addition to IBM's existing shelf registration under which $200 million *U* in debt securities are available for issuance *T*-1.
In secondary trading, investment - grade corporate bonds ended 1/8 to 1/4 higher.
Municipals
Actively traded municipal bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point higher in brisk trading, despite a flood of new supply.
New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 finished 1/4 point stronger at 98 1/2 bid, 0 *T*-1 to yield 7.32%.
Traders said 0 municipals were underpinned *-1 by influences including the climb in Treasury issue prices.
Also, municipal bonds lured buying because the stock market remains wobbly, traders contended 0 *T*-1.
Mainly, though, it was a favorable outlook for yesterday's new supply that *T*-1 propped up municipals, some traders said 0 *T*-2.
Among the new issues was *T*-1 Massachusetts's $230 million *U* of general obligation bonds.
The bonds were won *-1 by a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group with a true interest cost of 7.17%.
They were priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield from 6.00% in 1990 to 7.20% in 2009.
The Massachusetts deal had an unsold balance of $84.3 million *U* in late trading, the underwriter said 0 *T*-1.
Mortgage -, Asset - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities gained 3/32 to 9/32 point after a hectic session, with Government National Mortgage Association 8% securities as the standout issue.
The Ginnie Mae issue rose amid talk of large purchases of the securities by institutional investors.
The derivative markets remained active as one new issue was priced *-1 and talk *ICH*-2 circulated about more offerings in the next day or two.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issued a $500 million *U* real estate mortgage investment conduit backed * by its 8 1/2% securities.
In the asset - backed market, a big offering of Ford Motor Credit Corp . auto - loan securities was increased *-1 in size after strong institutional demand.
The deal by the Ford Motor Co. unit, priced * Monday, was increased *-1 to $3.05 billion *U* from $2.58 billion *U*.
Among major pass - through issues, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 98 15/32, up 5/32, after *PRO*-1 touching an early high of 98 27/32; 8% securities were at 94 5/32, up 9/32; 9 1/2% securities at 100 15/32, up 4/32; and 10% securities at 102 11/32, up 3/32.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 21/32, up 5/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.34% to a 12 - year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note held at 1.46 percentage points.
Foreign Bonds
The Eurodollar bond market sprang to life late in the European trading session after the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled.
Eurodollar bonds are often issued *-2 by foreign corporations, but interest and principal are paid *-1 in dollars.
The bonds ended about 1/2 point higher yesterday.
Prices of European government bonds also rose as U.S. stocks declined.
West Germany's 7% issue due October 1999 rose 0.13 point to 99.93 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.01%, while the 6 3/4% issue due July 1994 rose 0.05 to 97.70 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.33%.
Britain's 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003 / 2007 rose 17/32 to 112 6/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.05%, while the 12% notes due 1995 rose 11/32 to 104 2/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 10.93%.
In Japan, government bond prices fell.
The No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.22, down 0.17 point, *PRO*-1 to yield 5.41%.
David W. Lodge was elected *-1 *PRO*-2 vice president and chief financial officer, effective Nov. 1.
Mr. Lodge, 48 years old, a former finance executive at Singer Sewing Machine Co. and Celanese Corp., succeeds Francis L. Brophy, 64, who *T*-1 plans *PRO*-2 to retire from the company next year.
Bond prices took the high road and stock prices took the low road as worries *ICH*-1 mounted about the economy and the junk bond market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 in sluggish trading.
But long - term Treasury bonds staged a modest rally, with prices on most issues rising about half a point, or $5 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The dollar sagged against other major currencies in lethargic trading.
Traders and analysts said 0 the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook.
A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices, but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall.
That unease is expected *-2 to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders *T*-3 and again Thursday when the first assessment of third - quarter economic growth is released *-1 *T*-4.
Analysts say 0 they think 0 durable goods orders fell about 1%, compared with a 3.9% gain in August, and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3% from the second quarter's 2.5%.
The stock market's decline, coming after a record weekly gain of 119.88 points, surprised some investors.
But A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said 0 last week's rally was a reflex reaction to the Oct. 13 stock market rout.
Overall, he said 0 *?*, the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens.
"We think 0 we're on target in *PRO* looking for renewed economic deterioration," he said *T*-1.
"Corporate profits are going *-1 to decrease faster than interest rates will fall, and the probability is that we'll see negative economic growth in the fourth quarter."
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome, but he said 0 the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market.
In major market activity: Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 135.9 million shares.
Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 1,012 to 501.
Bond prices rallied.
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond slipped to 7.93%.
The dollar weakened against most other major currencies.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8470 marks and 141.90 yen, compared with 1.8578 marks and 142.43 yen late Friday.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Magazine publishers are facing spiraling costs and a glut of new titles.
But even a raft of recent failures isn't stopping them from *PRO*-1 launching new publications.
At the American Magazine Conference here, publishers are plenty worried *-1 about the industry's woes.
But they are also talking about new magazines.
For example, Toronto - based Telemedia Inc. will publish Eating Well, a new food and health magazine due out next summer.
New York - based Hearst Corp. this fall plans *PRO*-1 to publish its first issue of 9 Months, a magazine for expectant mothers, and has already launched American Home.
And Time Warner Inc. is developing a spinoff of Time magazine aimed * at kids, on the heels of its successful Sports Illustrated for Kids.
Over the past four years, the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of 80 magazines annually, according to Donald Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America.
"This is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry," said *T*-1 Mr. Kummerfeld.
"Entrepreneurs don't rush *PRO*-1 to get into a stagnant or declining industry."
And despite the recent tough advertising climate, industry figures released * at the meeting here indicate 0 things may be turning around.
For the first nine months, advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked * by the Publishers Information Bureau increased 4% from the same period last year, to 125,849 pages.
Total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased 12% to $4.6 billion *U*.
Though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate persists, the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry.
Though some magazines are thriving, the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business.
Within the same nine months, News Corp. closed down In Fashion, a once - promising young woman's fashion magazine, Drake Publications Inc. has folded the long - troubled Venture magazine, and Lang Communications has announced 0 Ms. magazine, after 17 years, will no longer carry advertising as of January.
Lang is cutting costs and will attempt *PRO*-1 to operate the magazine with only subscription revenue.
Meanwhile, American Health Partners, publisher of American Health magazine, is deep in debt, and Owen Lipstein, founder and managing partner, is being forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to sell the magazine to Reader's Digest Association Inc.
Mr. Lipstein's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble.
Mr. Lipstein said in a telephone interview from New York that the sale was proceeding as *PRO* planned *-1.
"The magazine is strong.
It's simply the right time 0 *PRO* to do what we are doing *T*-1 *T*-2," Mr. Lipstein said *T*-3.
"Magazines can no longer be considered *-1 institutions," said *T*-2 James Autry, president of Meredith Corp.'s magazine group.
"Publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die," he added *T*-1.
"Magazines could, like other brands, find that they have only a limited life."
There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs, traditionally depended upon * *PRO*-1 to break new ground with potentially risky start - ups, are dwindling.
More than ever, independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled *-1 up by larger publishing groups, such as American Express Publishing Corp., a unit of American Express Co., and Conde Nast Publications Inc., a unit of Advance Publications Inc., which *T*-2 are consolidating in order *PRO*-3 to gain leverage with advertisers.
Some entrepreneurs are still active, though.
Gerry Ritterman, president of New York - based Network Publishing Corp., earlier this year sold his Soap Opera Digest magazine to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
Mr. Ritterman said that in the next six months he will take $50 million *U* from the Soap Opera Digest sale *PRO*-1 to acquire new magazines.
He would not reveal which magazines he is considering *T*-1.
"The magazines 0 I am looking for *T*-1 are underdeveloped," said *T*-2 Mr. Ritterman.
"They could be old or new, but they are magazines whose editorial quality *T*-2 needs *-3 to be improved *-1.
They will be the next hot magazines.
Garry Kasparov went to combat Sunday with the world's most advanced chess computer and kicked it around--symbolically, anyway--like an old tin can.
*PRO*-1 Playing black in the first game, the human champion maneuvered Deep Thought, known * for its attacking prowess, into a totally passive position.
Then he unleashed his own, unstoppable, attack.
And in the second game, with Mr. Kasparov advancing ferociously as white, D.T. offered feeble resistance and lost even faster.
Well, mankind can rest easier for now.
Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26 - year - old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania - based computer, he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected *?*.
And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall *T*-1, he called the outcome.
As if he were Iron Mike, about *PRO* to enter the ring with a 98 - pound weakling, he declared: "I'll be able *PRO*-1 to beat any computer for the next five years."
His strategy against D.T. was based *-2 on a thorough study of dozens of its games, he said 0 *?*, including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. .
Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed *-2.
"The computer's mind is too straight, too primitive," *PRO*-1 lacking the intuition and creativity needed * *PRO* to reach the top, he said 0 *T*-2.
The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T.'s strong points.
Its chief builder, Taiwan - born Feng - hsiung Hsu, nicknamed his brainchild *PRO*-1 "the Weasel" for its tactical flair at *PRO* wriggling out of horrible positions.
D.T. also has a prodigious and flawless memory, is utterly fearless, and couldn't be distracted *-1 by the sexy nude sculptures spread * around the playing hall, in the New York Academy of Art.
In fact, D.T. never left home, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link.
They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov, but they put their hope in D.T.'s recently enhanced capacity for *PRO* examining positions--up to a million per second, from 720,000.
But the handlers mistakenly stuck with silicon chips; they needed kryptonite.
This became apparent as game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded.
No human can examine millions of moves, but Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones.
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980 *T*-1.
But the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly.
Instead of *PRO* castling, a standard measure 0 *PRO* to safeguard the king *T*-1, D.T. made a second - rate rook maneuver at move 13; then it put a knight offside on move 16.
"Only two classes of minds *ICH*-2 would think of this--very weak human players, and computers," said *T*-1 Edmar Mednis, the expert commentator for the match, which *T*-4 was attended *-3 by hundreds of chess fans.
By move 21, D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap.
It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark - squared bishop for one of D.T.'s knights.
Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights, but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left *-1 with a very dangerous knight and D.T.'s surviving bishop was reduced *-2 to passivity.
Indeed, it looked more like a pawn, a "tall pawn," as spectators snidely put it.
Consistently, D.T. was over - optimistic about its chances, which it continually sized up *T*-1, in numerical form.
When most spectators thought its position hopeless *T*-1, the computer thought 0 it was only, in effect, one - half of a pawn down.
Such evaluations met with derision, and kept the machine from *PRO*-1 resigning as soon as humans would have--*PRO* prompting more derision.
While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch, Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost.
He also launched a kingside storm, *PRO*-1 sacrificing a pawn *PRO*-2 to denude D.T.'s king.
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.
*PRO*-1 A piece down, the computer resigned.
Now, with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood, the only question seemed *-1 to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two *T*-3.
With the advantage of *PRO* playing white (which *T*-1 moves first), Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer's defense, a Queen's Gambit Accepted.
As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well - known sequence of moves, *PRO*-1 developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.
This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies--and it immediately blundered by *PRO* moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development.
"In a new position just after the opening, a computer will have serious problems," Mr. Kasparov said *T*-1 later.
In such positions, he explained 0 *?*, "you have *-2 to create something new, and the computer isn't able *PRO*-3 to do that right now."
After only 11 moves for each side, the computer's position was shaky.
Greedily, it grabbed a pawn, at the cost of *PRO*-1 facing a brutal attack.
And when a defensive move was called for *-1 *T*-2, D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats.
Mr. Kasparov remarked later that "even a weak club player" would have avoided the queen move.
Now, after only a dozen moves, spectators were looking for a mating combination.
On a demonstration board, emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated * by a knight sacrifice; no spectator refuted this line of play.
Mr. Kasparov's continuation was slower but, in the end, just as deadly.
He won D.T.'s queen for two minor pieces and two pawns--not enough compensation, in this position, 0 *T*-1 to give the computer much hope.
In a hopeless position, the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move.
And Mr. Kasparov, to cheers and applause, marched back into the analysis room.
"In both games I got exactly what I wanted *T*-1," he said *T*-2.
What he had demonstrated *T*-1, he added 0 *?*, is that there's more to chess than sheer calculation.
Undeterred, D.T.'s handlers vowed *PRO*-1 to press on.
Indeed, three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp.
Promises Feng - hsiung Hsu: "In three years we'll mount a better challenge."
Mr. Tannenbaum is a reporter in the Journal's New York bureau.
Your Sept. 21 article "It *EXP*-1's So Easy *PRO* to Get Burned *-2 When *PRO*-2 Buying a Small Firm *T*-3" was excellent.
I've been advising small businesses many years and have lived with the fact that 50% will go out of business within two years, and 80% in five years.
The economic loss, jobs lost *, anguish, frustration and humiliation are beyond measure.
And most of these are absolutely unnecessary.
Your article points out the traps 0 people fall into *T*-1, but when *PRO*-3 reviewing those traps *T*-2 one sees 0 just about all of them could have been avoided *-4.
An accountant did not review the seller's books before *PRO*-1 buying a business.
"I guess 0 I was naive," he said *T*-1.
There is a more descriptive word 0 *T*-1 to describe his lapse of common sense.
Corporate managers who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to start their own business are the highest failure risks.
They know all the answers and are not used to *PRO*-1 working more than 40 hours a week.
The blue - collar worker who *T*-1 decides *PRO*-2 to start a business will listen and take advice.
His humility gives him a much better chance of success.
A few months ago your paper reported the results of a study *PRO* to determine why Asians who *T*-1 arrive in this country without any money, and unable *PRO*-2 to speak English, become overnight successes *T*-3.
Their "secret" is that they gather a small group of advisers around them, listen to what they have *-1 to say *T*-2, prepare a business plan and they are on their way.
Successful American business owners do the same thing.
Unfortunately, they are in the minority.
*PRO* Avoiding failure is easy.
It *EXP*-2's unfortunate 0 so many must learn the hard way.
Daniel B. Scully Tucson, Ariz.
In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles, human behavior is being monitored *-1, dissected *-1 and, ultimately, manipulated *-1.
A squiggly line snakes across a video screen, *PRO*-1 gyrating erratically as subjects with hand - held computers register their second - by - second reactions to a speaker's remarks.
Agreement, disapproval, boredom and distraction all can be inferred *-1 from the subjects' twist of a dial.
In another experiment, an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how people's opinions were shaped *-1 *T*-3--and how they can be reshaped *-2 *T*-4.
Donald Vinson, who *T*-1 oversees the experiments, isn't some white - coated researcher.
He heads Litigation Sciences Inc., the nation's largest legal consulting firm, which *T*-1 is helping corporate America prepare for high - stakes litigation by *PRO* predicting and shaping jurors' reactions.
In the process, Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law.
*PRO* Little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within, Litigation Sciences, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, employs more than 100 psychologists, sociologists, marketers, graphic artists and technicians.
Twenty - one of its workers are Ph. D.s.
Among other services, the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls, creates profiles of "ideal" jurors, sets up mock trials and "shadow" juries, coaches lawyers and witnesses, and designs courtroom graphics.
Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing, the litigation advisers encourage their clients *PRO*-2 to play down complex or ambiguous matters, simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving 0 *T*-1 to make the desired choice.
With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time, companies are increasingly willing *PRO* to pay huge sums for such advice.
Recently, Litigation Sciences helped Pennzoil Co. win a $10.5 billion *U* jury verdict against Texaco Inc.
It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League.
And it helped *PRO* win defense verdicts in product - liability suits involving scores of products, ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin.
Largely as a result, Litigation Sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years.
Its 1988 revenue was $25 million *U*.
Meanwhile, competitors are being spawned *-1 almost daily; some 300 new businesses--many just one - person shops--have sprung up.
Mr. Vinson estimates 0 the industry's total revenues approach $200 million *U*.
In any high - stakes case, you can be sure that one side or the other--or even both--is using litigation consultants.
Despite their ubiquity, the consultants aren't entirely welcome.
Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented * in civics texts and memorialized * on the movie screen.
In the film classic "Twelve Angry Men," the crucible of deliberations unmasks each juror's bias and purges it from *PRO*-1 playing a role in the verdict.
After hours of conflict and debate, that jury focuses on the facts with near - perfect objectivity.
In real life, jurors may not always work that way, but some court observers question why they shouldn't be encouraged *-1 *PRO*-3 to do so rather than be programmed *-1 not *PRO*-4 to *?* *T*-2.
Litigation consulting is, as New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller puts it, "highly manipulative."
He adds, "The notion 0 they try *PRO*-1 to sell *T*-2 is that juries don't make decisions rationally.
But the effort *ICH*-1 is also being made *-2 *PRO* to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally.
I find it troubling."
But Mr. Zoeller also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective.
"It's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough, it *EXP*-2's almost malpractice *PRO* not to use them *T*-1," he says *T*-3.
Others complain that the consultants' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough *PRO* to afford such pricey services.
"The affluent people and the corporations can buy it, the poor radicals {in political cases} get it free, and everybody in between is at a disadvantage, and that's not the kind of system 0 we want *T*-2," says *T*-3 Amitai Etzioni, a prominent sociologist who *T*-1 teaches at George Washington University.
Sophisticated trial consulting grew, ironically, from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before *PRO*-1 finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases.
The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972, in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged *-1 with *PRO* plotting anti-war - related violence *T*-2, was a landmark.
In that case, a group of left - leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg.
The researchers discovered that Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants; the lawyers resolved *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to keep them off the jury.
The defense also learned that college - educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War.
A more blue - collar panel became a second aim.
Ultimately, that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10 - 2 vote 0 *T*-1 to acquit, and the prosecution decided *PRO*-2 not to retry the case.
Litigation consulting had arrived.
The fledgling science went corporate in 1977 when International Business Machines Corp. hired a marketing professor 0 *T*-1 to help *PRO* defend a complex antitrust case *T*-3.
The problem for IBM trial lawyers Thomas Barr and David Boies was how *PRO* to make such a highly technical case understandable *T*-1.
As the trial progressed, they were eager *PRO*-1 to know if the jury was keeping up with them.
The solution devised * by the professor was *PRO* to hire six people who *T*-1 would mirror the actual jury demographically, sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him.
He then briefed Messrs. Boies and Barr, who *T*-1 had the chance *PRO* to tilt their next day's presentation accordingly.
Thus, the "shadow" jury was born *-1.
Mr. Vinson, the professor, got the law bug and formed Litigation Sciences.
(IBM won the case.)
"The hardest thing in any complex case is *PRO* to retain objectivity and, in some sense, your ignorance," says *T*-1 Mr. Boies of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.
"What you look for *T*-2 in a shadow jury is very much what you do *T*-1 when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it *T*-3.
A shadow jury is a way 0 *PRO* to do that in a more systematic and organized way *T*-1."
The approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which Energy Transportation Systems Inc. sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal *T*-1--the kind of case likely *PRO* to make almost anyone's eyes glaze over.
Energy Transportation retained Litigation Sciences *ICH*-2, at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars, 0 *T*-1 to poll, pre-try, profile and shadow.
Just before the actual closing arguments, the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors, each of whom *T*-2 was being paid *-1 $150 *U* a day.
The jurors, who *T*-1 didn't know which side *T*-2 had retained them, decided for Energy Transportation, and awarded $500 million *U* in damages.
The real jury returned days later with a $345 million *U* victory for Energy Transportation.
"It's just like weather forecasting," says *T*-1 Energy Transportation trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson & Elkins.
"It's often wrong, but it's better than *PRO* consulting an Indian rain dancer."
Forecasting is only one part of Litigation Sciences' work.
*PRO* Changing the outcome of the trial is what *T*-1 really matters.
And to the uninitiated, some of the firm's approaches may seem *-1 chillingly manipulative.
Theoretically, jurors are supposed *-1 to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively.
Instead, Mr. Vinson says 0 *?*, interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try *PRO*-2 to shoe - horn the facts of the case 0 *T*-3 to fit their views.
Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror.
If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages *T*-1, for example, depressed, underemployed people are far more likely *-2 to grant them.
Someone with a master's degree in classical arts who *T*-1 works in a deli would be ideal, Litigation Sciences advises 0 *T*-2.
So would *?* *T*-1 someone recently divorced or widowed.
(Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense, its job is usually *PRO* to help the lawyers identify *RNR*-1 and remove *RNR*-1 *ICH*-2 such people from the jury.)
For personal - injury cases, Litigation Sciences seeks defense jurors who *T*-1 believe that most people, including victims, get what they deserve *T*-2.
Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped, the poor, blacks and women.
The consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by *PRO*-1 asking questions about potential jurors' attitudes toward volunteer work, or toward particular movies or books.
Litigation Sciences doesn't make moral distinctions.
If a client needs prejudiced jurors, the firm will help *PRO* find them.
As Mr. Vinson explains it, "We don't control the facts.
They are what they are *T*-1.
But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy 0 *PRO* to employ *T*-1.
In our system of advocacy, the trial lawyer is duty bound *PRO*-1 to present the best case 0 he possibly can *?* *T*-2."
Once a jury is selected *-1, the consultants often continue *-2 to determine what the jurors' attitudes are likely *-5 to be *T*-3 and help *PRO* shape the lawyers' presentation accordingly.
Logic plays a minimal role here.
More important are *T*-2 what LSI calls *T*-1 *PRO*-4 "psychological anchors"--a few focal points calculated * *PRO*-3 to appeal to the jury on a gut level.
In one personal - injury case, a woman claimed 0 she had been injured *-1 when she slipped in a pool *T*-3, but the fall didn't explain why one of her arms was discolored *-2 *PRO*-5 bluish *T*-4.
By *PRO*-1 repeatedly drawing the jury's attention to the arm, the defense lawyers planted doubt about the origin of the woman's injuries.
The ploy worked.
The defense won.
In a classic defense of a personal - injury case, the consultants concentrate on *PRO* encouraging the jury *PRO*-1 to shift the blame.
"The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is *PRO* to persuade the jurors *PRO*-1 to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight," Mr. Vinson has written *T*-2.
Slick graphics, pre-tested * for effectiveness, also play a major role in Litigation Sciences' operation.
Studies show, the consultants say 0 *?*, that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it visually.
Computer - generated videos help.
"The average American watches seven hours of TV a day.
They are very visually sophisticated," explains *T*-1 LSI graphics specialist Robert Seltzer.
Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this.
Supporters acknowledge that the process aims *PRO*-1 to manipulate, but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics.
"They may not have been able *PRO*-1 to articulate it all, but they did it," says *T*-2 Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at New York University law school.
"What you have *T*-1 here is intuition made *PRO* manifest."
Many lawyers maintain that all's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence.
Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment--and used that to advantage.
Litigation consulting isn't a guarantee of a favorable outcome.
Litigation Sciences concedes that in one in 20 cases it was flatout wrong in its predictions.
A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched * by consultants or of overpriced services--as when one lawyer paid a consultant (not at Litigation Sciences) $70,000 *U* *PRO*-1 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine *T*-2.
Some litigators scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what *T*-1 makes a jury tick.
"The essence of *PRO* being a trial lawyer is *PRO* understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation *T*-2," says *T*-3 Barry Ostrager of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, who *T*-1 recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co.
He says 0 he used consultants in the case but "found them to be virtually useless."
But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken.
And the question *ICH*-1 remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while *PRO*-2 undergoing such a skillful massage.
For more than a decade, Mr. Etzioni, the sociologist, has been a leading critic of the masseurs.
"There's no reason 0 *PRO* to believe that juries rule inappropriately *T*-1," he says *T*-2.
"But the last thing 0 you want *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 is *PRO* manipulate the subconscious *PRO*-3 to make them think better.
What you then do *T*-1 is 0 you make them think inappropriately."
*PRO* To hamper the work of litigation scientists, he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove *T*-2 from the jury panel through so - called peremptory challenges--exclusions that *T*-1 don't require explanations.
In most civil cases, judges allow each side three such challenges.
For complex cases, judges sometimes allow many more.
Mr. Etzioni also suggests *PRO* forbidding anyone from *PRO*-1 gathering background information about the jurors.
(Some courts release names and addresses, and researchers can drive by houses, look up credit ratings, and even question neighbors.)
Furthermore, he says 0 *?*, psychologists should not be allowed *-2 to analyze jurors' personalities.
Even some lawyers who *T*-1 have used consultants to their advantage see a need *PRO* to limit their impact.
Mr. Boies, the first lawyer 0 *T*-1 to use Mr. Vinson's services, cautions against courts' allowing extensive jury questioning (known * as voir dire) or giving out personal information about the jurors.
"The more extensive the voir dire, the easier you make it *EXP*-2 *?* for that kind of research to be effective, and I don't think 0 courts should lend themselves to that," Mr. Boies says *T*-1.
Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses in September fell 4.1% from a year ago to 1,120,317 units because of a slip in exports, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said 0 *T*-1.
Domestic demand continues *-2 to grow, but its contribution to higher production was sapped *-1 in September by the estimated 2% fall in imports, accompanied * by a growing tendency for Japanese manufacturers to build vehicles overseas, according to the association.
The association said 0 domestic demand grew 8.8% in September.
Demand has been growing consistently under the encouragement of pro-consumption government policies, an association spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
He also said 0 the introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April has helped sales.
The new tax, though a source of general resentment among Japanese taxpayers, replaced a higher commodities tax that *T*-1 applied to automobiles.
Japanese domestic motor - vehicle sales rose 12% in September, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said 0 *T*-1 earlier this month.
The manufacturers' association will issue statistics on vehicle exports later this month.
Production of cars rose to 801,835 units in September, a 5.5% increase from a year earlier.
Midsized cars accounted for the greatest growth in units, *PRO*-1 rising 62,872 units to 134,550 units, or 88%.
Minicar output more than tripled.
Manufacturers produced 46,835 of the vehicles--which *T*-1 have engines of 500 cubic centimeters or less--an increase of 31,777 units.
Total truck production fell 22% from a year earlier to 315,546 units.
Minitruck production fell 13% to 94,243 units.
Bus production also slipped, by 49% from a year earlier to 2,936 units.
The association spokesman said 0 bus production has declined since January, but couldn't offer an explanation for the fall.
Auto production for the first half of the fiscal year, which *T*-1 began in August, totaled 6,379,884 units, the association said 0 *T*-2.
Half - year production was up 3.4% compared with the same period a year earlier.
Lloyd's of London said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to clamp down on the ability *ICH*-2 of underwriting syndicates *PRO* to leave their annual accounts *PRO*-3 open beyond the customary three years.
Underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's, the world's largest insurance market, generally don't close their accounts for three years, *PRO*-1 to allow for the filing of claims and litigation.
When such claims and litigation extend beyond the period *T*-1, the syndicates can extend their accounting deadlines.
Lloyd's said 0 there are currently 115 open account years involving 68 of the market's roughly 360 syndicates.
The open - year accounting practice "is widely recognized *-1 within Lloyd's as of serious concern" to the 31,329 member investors, who *T*-2 underwrite insurance at Lloyd's in return for premium and investment income, Lloyd's said 0 *T*-3.
The procedure causes "great uncertainty" because an investor can't be sure of his or her individual liability, Lloyd's said 0 *T*-1.
As a result, the insurance market plans new measures 0 *T*-1 to restrict the ability *ICH*-2 of syndicate officials *PRO* to leave years *PRO*-3 open.
Lloyd's said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to enact new rules mandating the changes by year end.
Under the new rules, the officials will have *-1 to secure additional information and reports from actuaries, including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably.
In addition, officials will have *-1 to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors.
Weyerhaeuser Co. said 0 it sold its wall - paneling business to an affiliate of one of Indonesia's largest wood - products firms.
Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed *-1.
Weyerhaeuser said 0 its paneling business employs about 300 workers at two facilities in Chesapeake, Va., and Hancock, Vt.
The tougher new regulations under the savings - and - loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry's shrinking act.
Largely *PRO*-1 to meet tougher new capital requirements, thrifts reduced their assets $13.4 billion *U* in August, by *PRO*-1 selling such assets as mortgage - backed securities and loans.
Industry assets as of Aug. 31 were $1.31 trillion *U*, the lowest since August 1988.
As thrifts sell assets *PRO*-1 to improve their capital - to - asset ratio, as *PRO* required under the new law passed * in August, they must also reduce liabilities, such as deposits.
As interest rates paid depositors * were lowered *-1, thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $5.1 billion *U*, not including interest credited * to accounts.
It was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets *PRO*-1 to increase the size of their capital in relation to their assets *T*-2, the Office of Thrift Supervision said 0 *T*-3.
The asset shrinkage was particularly concentrated *-1 in several large California institutions.
"The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way," said *T*-1 Bert Ely, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va.
"This suggests 0 the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined *?* so soon."
James Barth, an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision, also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors.
"August is a month when people are paying school tuition *T*-1," he said *T*-2.
"That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry."
Not including thrifts under government conservatorship, S&Ls reduced their assets by $10.1 billion *U* from the previous month, and deposit outflows totaled $3.9 billion *U*.
For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August, assets declined by $3.3 billion *U* and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $1.2 billion *U*.
Thrifts raised capital mostly by *PRO*-3 selling mortgages and mortgage - backed securities, which *T*-2 were reduced *-1 by $7.8 billion *U* in August from the prior month.
As of Aug. 31, thrifts held $185 billion *U* in mortgage - backed securities.
The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $54 million *U*--the only net inflow in more than a year.
Deposits aren't expected *-1 to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future, as the industry continues *-2 to shrink.
"I think 0 we are going *-1 to see deposit shrinkage continue, unless we see big changes in rates," Mr. Ely said *T*-2.
For the first eight months of 1989, thrifts' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $44.5 billion *U*.
For the prior year, deposits exceeded withdrawals by $8.8 billion *U*.
France's industrial production index for July and August rose 1% from June and was up 4.6% from a year ago, according to seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistics Institute.
The state agency, which *T*-2 usually publishes the data on monthly basis, but traditionally combines the index for the two summer - holiday months, said 0 the advance was led *-1 by output of consumer goods, which *T*-3 rose 3.5% from June and was up 7.2% from a year earlier.
Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing, with a monthly rise of 2% and a year - on - year advance of 3%.
Food production was ahead 1.7% from June and 5.3% from a year earlier.
Output in the capital - goods sector was ahead 0.9% on a monthly basis and 2.7% year on year.
These gains were partly offset *-1 by output of cars and other consumer durables, which *T*-2 eased 3.9% from June's high level.
The sector was still 8.8% above its output levels from a year earlier, however.
Ironically, American Airlines' attempt *PRO* to lead industry prices higher was reported *-1 in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry (Sept. 20).
You quote Robert Crandall, chairman of American's parent, AMR Corp., as *PRO*-1 having said that discount deals for big customers would be "dumb" because "you will go to Detroit because you have *-2 to go to Detroit whether the fare is $175 *U*, $275 *U* or $375 *U*."
Even if Mr. Crandall is correct, he of all people must realize 0 our society relies on competition *PRO*-1 to keep prices at a competitive level.
In 1986, he settled an antitrust suit based * on a taped telephone conversation of him proposing to Braniff's president that they both raise fares 20%.
(Braniff declined).
When I asked American Airlines for its side of the story for use in my MBA class, where I teach business ethics *T*-1, *T*-2 it did not respond.
Perhaps the ethics of an industry's leader filters down and is one of the factors that *T*-1 ultimately shapes consumer trust in that industry.
Arnold Celnicker Assistant Professor Ohio State University
In an Oct. 10 editorial - page article, "It's the World Bank's Turn *PRO* to Adjust," Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what *T*-1 ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank.
The article is, unfortunately, replete with outrageous distortions.
One of Mr. Roberts's observations is that the Bank's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries.
This is just not so.
The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid.
As of June 30, 1989--the day 0 our past fiscal year came to a close *T*-2--only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected *-1 by arrears of over six months.
This is an enviably low level.
Moreover, the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $800 million *U* against possible loan losses.
For the same fiscal year, by the way, the Bank's net income was a robust $1.1 billion *U* after provisions.
Because of the business - like manner in which the Bank goes about development *T*-1, financial markets have confidence in it.
This helps *PRO* explain the triple - A rating enjoyed * by our bonds and our ability *PRO* to borrow $9.3 billion *U* in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms.
Another of Mr. Roberts's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good "by *PRO*-1 implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development."
Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark.
The reality is that Bank loans have been linked *-1 to policy improvements for 40 years.
Our traditional project loans have, for instance, supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector, sound interest - rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient, autonomous agencies.
By and large, these efforts have borne fruit.
In my home region, Latin America, much of the existing infrastructure base--an important building block for development--has been financed *-1 by the World Bank.
Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank's adjustment lending.
What *T*-1 are the facts on this type of lending?
The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years.
As their name implies, these operations are linked *-1 to far - reaching policy reforms that *T*-2 aim at *PRO* helping borrowing countries *PRO*-3 get back on the growth path and at *PRO* enhancing their credit - worthiness.
Typically, these measures include reforms 0 *PRO*-1 to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy, to open up inward - looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector.
Support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the Bank's.
Over the years, it has helped *PRO* encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the Third World through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the International Finance Corp.
Most recently, the Bank Group has been expanded *PRO*-2 to include the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency *PRO* to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by *PRO* offering guarantees against noncommercial risk and advice *ICH*-1 to member countries on how *PRO* to improve their business climate *T*-3.
These are not the actions of a development agency wed * to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government, as Mr. Roberts alleges.
Rather, they reflect the Bank's time - tested, pragmatic approach, which *T*-1 aims at *PRO* ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use.

but worries about 1990.
With most legislatures adjourned *-1 for the year, small business is tallying its scorecard.
Much of its attention was spent *-1 *PRO* fighting organized labor's initiatives on issues 0 the small - business community traditionally opposes *T*-2--from *PRO* raising state minimum wage levels to *PRO* mandating benefits in health plans.
While results were mixed in many states, "small business got by fairly well," concludes *T*-1 Don L. Robinson, associate director of the National Federation of Independent Business, the largest small - business organization.
Five states--Oregon, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Iowa and Wisconsin--passed bills 0 *T*-2 to boost the minimum wage, but measures in 19 other states were defeated *-1.
Oregon's rate will rise to $4.75 *U* an hour, the nation's highest, in Jan. 1, 1991.
Iowa's will be the second highest--at $4.65 *U* an hour in January 1992--but small - business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate.
In 17 central states, one small - business count shows 0 lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave.
The Illinois Legislature narrowly passed a parental - leave bill, which Gov. James Thompson vetoed *T*-1, and Iowa and Tennessee amended laws 0 *T*-2 to require that employers pay for breast - cancer exams.
Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year.
"Those kinds of issues always keep *-2 coming back," says *T*-3 Robert Beckwith, who *T*-1 manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce's small - business office.
DESPITE VICTORIES this year, small business fears *PRO*-1 losing parental - leave war.
Only two states--Vermont and Washington--this year joined five others requiring private employers *PRO*-1 to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants.
Similar proposals were defeated *-1 in at least 15 other states.
But small business, which *T*-1 generally detests government - mandated benefits, has taken note of the growing number of close votes.
"It's just a matter of time before the tide turns," says *T*-1 one Midwestern lobbyist.
Consequently, small business is taking more "pro-active" steps 0 *T*-1 to counter mandated leaves.
In Pennsylvania, small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative; they favor a commission that *T*-1 would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt *T*-2.
They also support a tax credit for employers 0 *T*-2 to offset the cost of *PRO* hiring and training workers who *T*-1 temporarily replace employees on parental leave.
In 1990, the issue is expected *-1 to be especially close in Alaska, California, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
"We'll be playing a lot of defense, especially in the Midwest and Northeast," says *T*-1 Jim Buente of the NFIB.
IN LOS ANGELES, more small businesses ponder *PRO*-1 adopting a child - care policy.
Triggering the re-examination is *T*-1 a recent city council decision *PRO* to give preference in *PRO* letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees.
The preferential treatment even applies to *PRO* awarding small contracts under $25,000 *U* and consulting and temporary services--which *T*-1 often go to the smaller concerns.
Firms are permitted *-1 wide flexibility in the child - care arrangements 0 they provide *T*-2.
Council member Joy Picus, the measure's chief advocate, considers it part of a "pro-family policy" that *T*-1 makes Los Angeles a leader in "*PRO* humanizing the workplace."
NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that *T*-1 especially affect small business.
In San Francisco, small businesses are urging passage of a local initiative 0 *T*-1 to build a new $95 million *U* downtown baseball stadium; they believe 0 it will spur retail sales and hotel - restaurant business.
But in Washington state, small business generally opposes an initiative 0 *T*-2 to boost spending on children's programs by $360 million *U*, *PRO*-3 fearing 0 the state's 7.8% sales tax will be raised *-1 *PRO* to finance the outlays.
DIALING DOLLARS:
Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area - code switch Nov. 11--to 708 from the familiar 312--won't be without some costs as they alter stationery, among other things, and notify customers.
Wessels & Pautsch, a small St. Charles law firm, plans *PRO*-1 to mail 500 customers a list of its lawyers' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards.
But many owners plan *PRO*-1 to practice frugality--*PRO*-2 crossing out the old code and writing in the new one until their stock runs out.
Even print - shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville won't discard his old supply.
(He reports 0 his business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock.)
CALIFORNIA, A TREND - SETTER in franchising rules, stirs a controversy.
With some new rules, state officials say 0 they made it *EXP*-2 easier--and faster--*PRO* to sell new franchises whose terms *T*-1 stray from those in state - registered contracts.
Previously, regulators insisted that franchisers pre-register such changes with the state--a costly process taking at least six weeks.
Now some negotiated sales that *T*-2 meet a series of tests don't have *-3 to be pre-registered *-1.
For instance, franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who *T*-1 qualify as "sophisticated purchasers."
Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $1 million *U*, $200,000 *U* annual income, or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold *.
But critics consider the changes regressive.
Lewis G. Rudnick, a Chicago lawyer who *T*-2 represents franchisers, contends 0 California is narrowly limiting *RNR*-1--rather than expanding *RNR*-1--opportunities for *PRO* negotiating sales.
He argues 0 California regulators historically have misinterpreted their law--and he says 0 negotiated sales that *T*-1 aren't pre-registered have been legal all along.
San Francisco lawyer Timothy H. Fine, who *T*-1 represents franchisees, insists 0 California's cautiousness helps *PRO* protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who *T*-2 push unlawful clauses.

At least 10 states are resisting Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s nationwide effort 0 *T*-1 to settle its legal troubles, and some might instead try *PRO*-2 to revoke the firm's license 0 *PRO* to sell securities within their borders *T*-3.
The reluctance *ICH*-2 of some states *PRO* to let Drexel off the hook could hamper the firm's attempts *PRO* to polish its image after its guilty plea to six felonies last month, say 0 *T*-1 several people familiar with the discussions.
Up to now, Drexel has made a rapid - fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
Just yesterday, New Hampshire announced 0 it made a $75,000 *U* settlement with Drexel, a record - tying fine for a securities - law matter in that state.
These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm's efforts 0 *T*-1 to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon.
But individuals familiar with the generally successful Drexel talks say 0 the firm is meeting resistance from some big states, including New Jersey, New York, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Missouri.
Officials in some of these states say 0 they don't want *PRO*-1 to simply accept the settlements offered * by Drexel.
They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny - stock firms whose brokerage licenses *T*-1 are routinely revoked.
Drexel has *-2 to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that *T*-1 includes payment of $650 million *U* in penalties.
These stem from a two - year federal investigation of insider trading *RNR*-1 and securities fraud *RNR*-1 on Wall Street.
Ohio, the District of Columbia, Tennessee and Illinois have been less resistant to Drexel than the other six states, but nonetheless have refused *PRO*-1 to settle so far, say 0 *T*-2 those familiar with the discussions.
Drexel says 0 it doesn't expect 0 any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked *-1, and even if some are *?*, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt *-2.
It already has sold its retail, or individual - investor, brokerage network; securities firms don't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking.
Still, if nothing else, a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed *-1 in many of the transactions in which Drexel could be involved *-3 *T*-2.
Securities regulators praise Drexel for its energetic effort, led * by government - approved general counsel Saul S. Cohen, 0 *T*-1 to settle its legal problems with the states.
But they disagree about the message 0 these settlements give *T*-1 to the public.
"There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue," said *T*-1 Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's chief securities regulator and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which *T*-3 drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with Drexel.
The question, she said 0 *?*, is whether Drexel should be allowed *-3 to pay and move on, or "whether you should (simply) revoke the license when someone is convicted *-1 of a felony *T*-4."
While Ms. Bryant's state went ahead and accepted Drexel's settlement offer of $25,000 *U*, she said: "I don't have any argument with those who *T*-1 came to different conclusions.
I can see both sides."
Similarly, Alfred Rubega, New Hampshire's director of securities regulation, said 0 his state hadn't received any complaints about Drexel, so it really couldn't press the issue.
Still, "I understand the reasons" that other states are holding out *T*-1, he said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Cohen, the Drexel general counsel, said, "I don't think, as we say in investment banking, that ` by the end of the day' we'll be losing any licenses."
*PRO*-5 Asked *-4 about states that *T*-1 are taking a hard line, he said, "There are states that *T*-2 have asked for additional information, which we are providing *T*-3 to them."
Mr. Cohen said 0 more than $2.8 million *U* has been paid *-1 to 26 states and that Drexel still expects *PRO*-2 to pay out a total of $11.5 million *U*.
By the end of this week, Drexel should have another three to four settlements, Mr. Cohen said *T*-1.
"The rate 0 we're going *T*-1, I think that by the end of the month, we're looking *PRO*-2 to have a total of 30 to 35," he said *T*-3.
That total would be important for Drexel.
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation 0 *T*-1 to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.
A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday.
There are, according to several securities commissioners, at least 16 states that *T*-1 are either close to settlements with Drexel or who *T*-2 don't appear *-3 opposed to settling.
Drexel's proposed state fines have been based *-1 on a state's population and on the size of Drexel's business in the state.
New Jersey, for example, was asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to accept $300,000 *U*, but refused.
The state isn't ruling out *PRO*-1 revoking Drexel's brokerage license.
The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser.
State officials won't describe their position in detail, but James McLelland Smith, state securities chief, said: "We really are still looking at it and have informed (Drexel) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement."
Connecticut already has issued a "notice of intent" *PRO* to revoke Drexel's brokerage license.
It is one of the states that *T*-1 have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters.
"This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital - formation market," state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said *T*-1.
A banking department spokesman added: "Commissioner Brown doesn't feel 0 that money alone is the issue here."
Particularly touchy are *T*-3 the cases of New York, which *T*-1 is Drexel's base, and California, the base of Drexel's highly profitable junk - bond operation that *T*-2 led to the firm's legal difficulties.
Neither state has settled, and officials in the two states won't discuss their reasons for *PRO* not doing so.
But Drexel has made it *EXP*-3 clear 0 it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked *-4, according to state officials.
Ms. Bryant, the head of the state securities group, said 0 Drexel has done a better job of *PRO* settling with the states than E.F. Hutton did *?* after its guilty plea to a massive check - kiting scheme several years ago.
Still, she said 0 *?*, Drexel's trouble with some states isn't a bad thing.
"This process should point out that it *EXP*-2's not going *-1 to be easy for a firm that *T*-5's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business," Ms. Bryant said *T*-3.
"We need *-1 to have somebody worried *-2 so they don't do this again."
These are the 26 states, including the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, that *T*-1 have settled with Drexel: Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wyoming and Puerto Rico.
Standard & Poor's Corp. said 0 it would add John H. Harland Co., an Atlanta check printer, to its 500 - stock index, effective at the close of trading on Wednesday.

Eagle Clothes Inc., which *T*-1 is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, said 0 it reached an agreement with its creditors.
Under the accord, Albert Roth, chairman and chief executive officer, and Arthur Chase, Sam Beigel, and Louis Polsky will resign as officers and directors of the menswear retailer.
Mr. Roth, who *T*-2 has been on leave from his posts, will be succeeded *-1 by Geoffrie D. Lurie of GDL Management Inc., which *T*-3 is Eagle's crisis manager.
Mr. Lurie is currently co-chief executive.
Arnold Levine, acting co-chief executive, will continue as senior vice president and a board member.
Eagle also said 0 it received a commitment for as much as $8 million *U* in financing from Norfolk Capital Group Inc.
In addition, a Norfolk affiliate, York Capital Inc., will purchase all of the interests of Eagle's secured lenders, which *T*-1 total $11.5 million *U*, and guarantee as much as $8.2 million *U* in payments to Eagle's unsecured creditors.
A committee representing the unsecured creditors agreed *PRO*-1 to accept 24 cents on the dollar, Eagle said 0 *T*-2.
The plan would extend the period under which Eagle has the exclusive right 0 *T*-1 to file a reorganization plan *T*-2.
It would extinguish all of Eagle's existing capital stock and issue new stock to York as sole holder.
A bankruptcy court hearing *ICH*-1 is set *-2 for Nov. 3 on these accords.
In its bankruptcy - law petition, filed * in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Eagle said 0 its problems began in 1987 and early 1988 when its then - senior lender, Bankers Trust Co., reduced its credit line *T*-1.
In September 1988, Eagle acquired Biny Clothing Inc., a closely held New York chain operated * under the Bonds name.
Eagle's management retired and Biny's management took control of the company.
At the time, Eagle reached a new credit agreement with Bankers Trust and with Bank Leumi Trust Co. of New York for $8 million *U*, and a new subordinated debt accord with First Century Partners and Biny management for $2 million *U*.
But Eagle said 0 the financing was insufficient and sales during the past fiscal year sagged.
Under Chapter 11, a company operates under protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan *PRO* to pay debts.
International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy 0 *T*-2 to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face *T*-1 when *PRO* computerizing their operations *T*-3: Most machines can't talk to each other.
The company unveiled more than 50 products, mostly software, that *T*-1 are designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation--the plant floor, design operations and production planning.
The aim, ultimately, is *PRO* to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer's main computer network for use in business planning, marketing and other operations.
Manufacturers have already spent so heavily on automation that they are one of the computer industry's leading revenue sources.
But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered *-1 *PRO*-2 nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used * by different machines, including robots and machine tools.
IBM's announcement, which *T*-1 was expected *-2 and will formally be made *-2 to customers today, also marks an attempt *PRO* to gain credibility on the plant floor, where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated *T*-3 and where Hewlett - Packard Co. has recently gained market share *T*-4.
Consultants have said that it *EXP*-1 will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place, even though the specific products 0 IBM unveiled *T*-2 will generally be available by the end of the first quarter.
Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., said that in the past IBM has developed broad software strategies only for problems that *T*-1 crossed industry lines.
He said 0 he believes 0 IBM's decision *PRO* to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about *PRO* understanding customers' problems and wasn't just selling technology.
He said 0 he expects IBM to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months.
IBM's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing.
Rather than *PRO* just send out marketing people *PRO*-1 to knock on customers' doors, IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available *PRO*-2 to discuss specific needs.
IBM's manufacturing staff also will be able *PRO*-2 to provide software that IBM has developed internally *T*-1 and will be able *PRO*-2 to form teams with a customer 0 *T*-3 to jointly solve manufacturing problems.
IBM can obviously bring its expertise *PRO* to bear on problems related * to computer manufacturing, but it could also help customers on software 0 *T*-1 to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents.
"We may not have every manufacturing problem, but we have most," said *T*-1 George Conrades, IBM's top marketing official.
With reduced exports and rising imports, South Korea's trade surpluses with the U.S. and Europe between January and September fell sharply from a year ago, the Customs Administration said 0 *T*-1.
Officials said 0 South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. for the first nine months of the year totaled $3.49 billion *U*, down 43% from the same period last year on a customs - clearance basis.
South Korean exports to the U.S. during the period fell 1.6% from a year ago to $15.06 billion *U*, while imports from the U.S. soared 26% to $11.56 billion *U*.
The trade surplus with Europe was pegged *-1 at $414 million *U*, down 57% from a year ago.
Officials said 0 South Korean exports to Europe dropped 5.3% to $3.02 billion *U* while imports from there went up 17% to $2.61 billion *U*.
Meredith Corp. is launching a new service 0 *T*-1 to offer advertisers package deals combining its book, magazine and videocassette products.
The Des Moines - based publisher said 0 it created a new Custom Marketing Group that *T*-1 will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines, such as Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens.
In addition, the group will create custom - designed media such as cookbooks, newspaper inserts and videos for ad campaigns.
Earlier this year, Meredith sold its first such package for $3 million *U* to Kraft Inc., now a unit of New York - based Philip Morris Cos.
The Kraft package included a specially published cookbook, a national free - standing insert in Sunday newspapers, and a Kraft "advertorial" section that *T*-1 ran in five Meredith magazines.
Kraft recently agreed *PRO*-1 to spend an additional $3 million *U* on similar programs through 1990.
Bill Murphy, director of the new marketing unit, said 0 Meredith is negotiating other large - scale packages with leading companies in several product categories, but he wouldn't disclose their names.
Sources close to the company and ad agencies that *T*-1 work with Meredith said 0 leading advertisers in consumer electronics, packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the Meredith group.
Other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction.
The New York Times Co.'s Magazine Group earlier this year began *-1 offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built * around *PRO* buying ad pages in its Golf Digest magazine.
Time Warner Inc. recently formed a "synergy department" 0 *T*-2 to seek out ways 0 *PRO* to offer advertisers packages that *T*-1 could combine Time's magazines with Warner products such as videocassettes *T*-3.
Paul DuCharme, director of media services at Grey Advertising, said 0 Meredith is the leader in *PRO* providing multimedia packages.
"They may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together *T*-1, but for now they are the quickest offering the most extensive plan," he said *T*-2.
Mr. Murphy of Meredith said 0 one advertiser, which he wouldn't identify *T*-3, wants Meredith to provide ad pages in seven Meredith magazines, publish an interior - decorating book that *T*-2 will be distributed *-1 at point of purchase, give away a videotape on installation pointers, and possibly use Meredith's Better Homes and Gardens' residential real - estate agents *PRO*-4 to distribute discount - coupon books to new homeowners.
"Five years ago, magazine publishers would simply bid on an advertiser's big ad schedule for their magazine," said *T*-1 Mr. Murphy.
"But the marketplace changed.
Advertisers now say ` *PRO* Help us improve our image and extend our selling season . '
They are coming to publishers *PRO*-1 looking for ideas.
Some House Democrats are trying *PRO*-2 to head off an appointment by President Bush to the board that *T*-1 oversees the savings - and - loan bailout, *PRO*-2 contending that the prospective nominee is the head of troubled banks himself.
Four Democrats on the House Banking Committee sent President Bush a letter stating their concerns about the expected appointment of James Simmons, an Arizona banker and former fund - raiser for Mr. Bush, to the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp.
The Oversight Board, created * in the savings - and - loan law signed * in August, sets policy for the RTC, which *T*-1 will sell hundreds of the nation's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp are members of the board.
President Bush must appoint two other members, one a Democrat and one a Republican.
An administration official confirmed last week that Mr. Simmons, the chairman of Valley National Bank in Phoenix, is the Republican appointee, and that a security clearance was under way.
The Democratic appointee hasn't been determined *-1, the official said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Simmons declined *PRO*-1 to comment, and the White House said 0 the congressmen's letter is under review.
The letter, dated * last Thursday, cited the losses at Valley National, and at United Bank, also of Phoenix, where Mr. Simmons was chairman for 29 years *T*-1.
Both banks have been battered *-1, as have *?* other Arizona banks, by falling real estate prices.
Valley National, for example, had $470 million *U* in problem assets as of June.
"We believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you *PRO*-2 to give them your thorough consideration before *PRO* making this key RTC appointment," the letter said *T*-1.
"The RTC needs the most able, competent management available."
But Mr. Simmons has long ties to both Republicans and banking.
He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's Arizona campaign committee in last year's election, and also worked for Mr. Bush in the 1980 election.
The two met more than 30 years ago, when Mr. Simmons worked for Commercial Bank & Trust Co. of Midland, Texas, where Mr. Bush was an organizing director *T*-1 *T*-2.
In 1986, Mr. Simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed * by William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.
That committee determined *PRO*-1 to open Arizona to banking across state lines.
Arizona Trend magazine referred to Mr. Simmons this year as one of the 25 most influential people in the state.
The letter to Mr. Bush was signed *-1 by Reps. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.), the chairman of the Banking Committee's RTC Task Force, Thomas McMillen (D., Md.), Kweisi Mfume (D., Md .) and Paul Kanjorski (D., Pa .).
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp called on the Federal Reserve System *PRO*-1 to lower interest rates.
In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association, Mr. Kemp broke the administration's public silence on the Fed and complained that "interest rates are too high."
"I am convinced that a monetary policy for this country that *T*-2 would return interest rates to the historical level of 4% or 5% would have not only an immediate impact on housing starts, the housing stock, our industry in America, the refurbishing of our industrial system, it would help the Third World economies considerably and it would particularly have a favorable impact upon our budget deficit," Mr. Kemp said *T*-1.
The Fed recently eased credit by *PRO*-1 lowering the bellwether federal funds interest rate to 8 3/4% from about 9%.
Bush administration officials say 0 inflation is under control.
With economic growth slowing, they say 0 they believe 0 the Fed should ease credit even further.
But for the most part, officials have avoided *PRO*-1 expressing those views in public, *PRO*-1 fearing 0 they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed.
Raw - steel production by the nation's mills decreased 0.7% last week to 1,816,000 tons from 1,828,000 tons the previous week, the American Iron and Steel Institute said 0 *T*-1.
Last week's output fell 1.7% from the 1,848,000 tons produced * a year earlier.
The industry used 81.6% of its capability last week, compared with 82.2% the previous week and 86.2% a year ago.
The American Iron and Steel Institute reported: 0 The capability utilization rate is a calculation designed * *PRO* to indicate at what percent of its production capability the industry is operating in a given week *T*-1.
Silicon Graphics Inc., a fast - growing maker of computer workstations, said 0 it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $100 million *U* over the next five years.
One award is part of a Department of Defense contract to Loral Rolm Mil - Spec Computers and could be valued *-1 at more than $100 million *U* over five years.
The other involves the sale of about 35 of the company's high - end workstations to the National Institutes of Health.
The models, which *T*-2 cost about $75,000 *U* each, will be used *-1 in research.
The awards are evidence that Silicon Graphics' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers, analysts said 0 *T*-1.
"The company's on a roll," said *T*-1 Robert Herwick, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist.
"No other {computer} vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price."
In the battle 0 *T*-3 to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers, most of the attention is given *-1 to the biggest competitors: Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett - Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp., which *T*-2 make computers mainly aimed * at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs.
Silicon Graphics, on the other hand, has targeted a specific niche *ICH*-1 since its inception in 1982, which *T*-3 has been dubbed *-2 by some as "motion - picture computing."
This is a style of "visual" computing that *T*-1 provides three - dimensional, color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women's fashion.
Though Silicon Graphics is much smaller than Digital, Hewlett and Sun, it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market.
In addition, the company has made it tough on competitors by *PRO*-1 offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices.
A year ago, Silicon Graphics introduced a model priced * at $15,000 *U*--almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that *T*-1 don't offer special graphics features.
Silicon Graphics also plans *PRO*-1 to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future.
"It *EXP*-1's pretty safe *PRO* to assume 0 we can bring the cost *ICH*-2 down of these systems by 30% to 40% a year," said *T*-3 Edward McCracken, the company's chief executive officer.
Silicon Graphics' strategy seems *-1 to be paying off.
Revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 was $86.4 million *U*, a 95% increase over the year - ago period.
Profit was $5.2 million *U*, compared with $1 million *U* for the year - ago quarter.
About 400,000 commuters trying *PRO* to find their way through the Bay area's quake - torn transportation system wedged cheek - to - jowl into subways, sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday.
In other words, it was a better - than - average Manhattan commute.
City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed *-1 following last Tuesday's earthquake *T*-2.
The massive temblor, which *T*-1 killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south.
It *EXP*-1 will take several weeks *PRO* to repair the bridge, and several months *PRO* to repair some of the 101 connections.
But in spite of a wind - driven rainstorm, gridlock never materialized, mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50% more passengers than normal.
For the first time in memory, it was standing - room only in BART's sleek, modern railcars.
Moreover, the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay didn't charge tolls, *PRO* allowing traffic to zip through without *PRO* stopping.
Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers 0 *T*-1 to get workers to come in at odd hours, or that many workers are still staying at home.
Many commuters who *T*-2 normally drove across the Bay Bridge, which *T*-3 is shut *-1 down for several weeks because of damage to one span, actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided 0 they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.
In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, *PRO*-1 often experiencing back - ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more.
Not that *PRO* getting into town was easy.
Storm flooding caused back - ups on the freeway, and many commuters had *-1 to find rides to BART's stations, because parking lots were full before dawn.
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray, *PRO* stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan.
Her commute from Petaluma, Calif., normally takes an hour and 15 minutes, via the Golden Gate Bridge, which *T*-1 connects San Francisco with the North Bay area.
Yesterday, she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours, *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to transfer to a bus going to the financial district.
"It's worse than I thought *?*," she said *T*-1.
"I don't know where all the buses are *T*-1."
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate, by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out.
"It's one of the smoothest commutes 0 I've ever had *T*-1," said *T*-2 Charles Catania, an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County.
"It looks like a holiday.
I think 0 a lot of people got scared and stayed home."
However, a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said 0 yesterday's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day.
At the San Mateo Bridge, which *T*-2 connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay, police were surprised *-1 at the speed with which traffic moved *T*-3.
"Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated," said *T*-1 Stan Perez, a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol.
There were many indications that the new work hours implemented * by major corporations played a big role.
The Golden Gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday, but over four hours rather than the usual two - hour crush.
Bechtel Group Inc., the giant closely held engineering concern, says 0 it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement, whereby employees may select any eight - hour period during those hours 0 *PRO* to go to work *T*-1 *T*-2.
Of Bechtel's 17,500 employees, about 4,000 *T*-1 work in San Francisco--one - third of them commuting from stricken East Bay.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is offering its 6,000 San Francisco employees a two - tier flextime schedule--either 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The flextime may cut by almost a third the number of PG&E employees working conventional 9 - 5 hours, a spokesman says 0 *T*-1.
Some of the utility's employees may opt for a four - day workweek, 10 hours a day, *PRO* to cut the commute by 20%.
At Pacific Telesis Group, flextime is left *-1 up to individual working groups, because some of the telephone company's employees must be on - site during normal business hours, a spokeswoman says 0 *T*-2.
Some individuals went to some lengths on their own *PRO*-1 to avoid the anticipated gridlock.
One senior vice president at Bechtel said 0 he got up at 3 a.m. *PRO*-1 to drive into San Francisco from the East Bay.
But transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last.
Although one transportation official said 0 drivers who *T*-1 didn't use car pools were committing "an anti-social act," about two - thirds of the motorists crossing the Golden Gate were alone, compared with the normal 70% rate.
And some commuters, relieved * by the absence of gridlock, were planning *PRO*-1 to return to their old ways.
Two Japanese scientists said 0 they discovered an antibody that, in laboratory test - tube experiments, *T*-1 kills AIDS - infected cells while *PRO*-2 preserving healthy cells.
If further experiments are successful, the work would represent a major advance in research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The drug AZT, the only treatment currently on the market, claims *PRO*-1 only to help *PRO* stop the spread of AIDS, not to cure it.
But several analysts and Japanese scientists familiar with the study, which *T*-2 was announced *-1 at a conference in Nagoya yesterday, expressed skepticism over the significance of the results.
And the researchers themselves acknowledged 0 they still must do much more work before they can say whether the treatment would actually cure humans.
Shin Yonehara, a research scientist at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, said 0 the antibody 0 he discovered *T*-2 works by *PRO* recognizing an antigen called * *PRO*-3 a Fas - antigen, which *T*-1 is characteristic of an infected cell.
The antibody then kills the cell.
Dr. Yonehara and his partner, Nobuyuki Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University, said 0 their experiments showed that the antibody wiped out an average of 60% of AIDS - infected cells within three days.
In some of the experiments, it killed almost all the infected cells, the researchers said 0 *T*-1.
Meanwhile, fewer than 10% of the healthy cells were killed *-1.
The two said 0 they must still do more laboratory tests, then experiment on animals.
They said 0 they hoped *PRO*-1 to conduct tests on human patients in the U.S. by late next year.
Japan doesn't have enough AIDS patients *PRO*-1 to do significant experimentation in that country, they said 0 *T*-2.
The announcement got wide exposure in the Japanese media, and even moved some pharmaceutical stocks yesterday.
But Takashi Kitamura, director of the biology department at Japan's National Institute of Health and secretary of the government's AIDS - research center, said, "I'm not so optimistic of its future use in therapeutic methods."
He said 0 some infected cells may not have the relevant antigen and so wouldn't be killed *-1 even after exposure to the antibody.
"The results seem *-1 to be very premature," said *T*-2 Mitsuru Miyata, editor of Nikkei Biotechnology, a leading Japanese industry newsletter.
Dr. Kobayashi responded that he thought 0 the antibody could potentially kill all infected cells.
But he and Dr. Yonehara said 0 there were still several uncertainties, particularly regarding possible side effects.
"Our antibody specifically killed infected cells at a very low dose, but it can also kill other cells," said *T*-1 Dr. Yonehara.
"We don't know the effect of our antibody on the human body."
AIDS isn't considered *-1 a widespread problem in Japan--the government reports about 1,000 known carriers of the virus--but many companies have poured substantial resources into research in recent years, *PRO*-2 hoping *PRO*-3 to cash in on a possible cure.
Dr. Kitamura said 0 about 35 projects are currently under way in Japan, and that Japanese researchers in the past year have made available *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 three possible cures to American researchers for clinical tests.
He said that when scientists from the two countries meet again in January in New Orleans *T*-1, the Japanese will present at least three more drugs for human testing.
AZT is the world's only prescription medicine approved * for *PRO* treating the disease.
Wellcome PLC, a major British pharmaceutical maker, sells the drug under the name Retrovir.
A Wellcome spokesman declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the discovery of the antibody in Japan.
But Andrew Porter, a drug - industry analyst at Nikko Securities Co. in London, said 0 if the product were *-2 to be successfully developed *-1 it would represent "a potential threat to the long - term viability of Retrovir.
EAST GERMANY'S KRENZ WARNED against further pro-democracy protests.
After the legislature confirmed him as the Communist Party leader, Krenz said 0 demonstrations *PRO* to demand democratic freedoms could cause a "worsening of the situation, or confrontation."
He also reaffirmed East Germany's allegiance to Communist orthodoxy.
But as many as 12,000 people marched in East Berlin after the speech *PRO*-1 to protest his election.
During the balloting, 26 members of the 500 - seat Parliament voted against Krenz, a move considered *PRO* unprecedented in the country's 40 - year history.
Officials in East Berlin, *PRO*-1 responding to complaints from opposition groups, admitted 0 police used excessive force in *PRO*-2 dispersing protesters this month.
The Iran - Contra judge agreed *PRO*-1 to allow Poindexter to subpoena the personal papers of ex-President Reagan, *PRO*-1 ruling that there was sufficient evidence that the data would be important to the defense.

The Philippine merchandise trade deficit widened to $1.71 billion *U* during the first eight months of 1989 from $807 million *U* a year earlier.
Imports continued *-1 to outpace Philippine exports, despite gains in shipments abroad, the government National Statistics Office said 0 *T*-2.
Exports reached $5.12 billion *U*, up from $4.52 billion *U* a year earlier, while imports rose to $6.81 billion *U* from $5.33 billion *U*.
The trade deficit in the first eight months is already wider than the trade gap of $1.09 billion *U* for all of 1988.
Analysts expect the trade gap for the year to surpass $2 billion *U* as demand for capital equipment and raw materials continues *-1 to push imports higher.

Why can't we teach our children *PRO*-1 to read, write and reckon *T*-2?
It's not that we don't know how *PRO* to *?* *T*-1, because we do *?*.
It's that we don't want *PRO*-1 to *?*.
And the reason 0 we don't want *PRO*-1 to *?* *T*-2 is that effective education would require us *PRO*-3 to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests.
These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it *EXP*-1 seems *-2 almost blasphemous *PRO* to challenge them.
Here is *T*-1 an example.
If I were *-1 to ask a sample of American parents, "Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children?" the near - unanimous answer would be, "Yes, of course."
But what do we mean *T*-1, specifically, by "creativity"?
No one can say *?*.
In practice, it ends up *PRO*-3 being equated *-1 with a "self - expression" that *T*-2 encourages the youngsters' "self - esteem."
The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence *T*-2 is matched *-1 only by their good opinion of themselves.
The whole notion of "creativity" in education was *RNR*-3 (and is *RNR*-3) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction, which *T*-1 was (and is) regarded *-2 as "authoritarian," a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful, if as yet undefined, potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children.
It *EXP*-2 is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive.
Fortunately, these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as *PRO* traditionally understood *-2, and they have enough common sense *PRO*-3 to know what that demands *T*-1.
Their commitment to "creativity" cannot survive adolescent illiteracy.
American education's future will be determined *-1 by the degree to which we--all of us--allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share *T*-2 *T*-3.
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way.
The reasons are complex, but one simple reason ought not *-1 to be underestimated *-2.
"Progressive education" (0 as it was once called *-1 *PRO*-3 *T*-2) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is *?* disciplined instruction.
It is nice for teachers to think 0 they are engaged *-1 in "personality development" and even nicer *PRO* to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results.
It also provides teachers with a superior self - definition as a "profession," since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy.
I myself took such courses in college, *PRO*-1 thinking 0 I might end up a schoolteacher.
They could all fairly be described *-1 as "pap" courses.
But it *EXP*-3 is unfair *PRO* to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment.
I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.
They may not be among the "best and brightest" of their generation--there are very few such people, by definition.
But they need not *PRO*-1 be *?* *PRO*-1 to do their jobs well.
Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days.
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who *T*-1 were merely competent and conscientious.
In this sense, a teacher can be compared *-1 to one's family doctor.
If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place.
If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well.
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis.
Whether they are *RNR*-4 or are not *RNR*-4 underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem.
It *EXP*-5 is silly libel on our teachers *PRO* to think 0 they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more.
It is the kind of libel 0 the teachers' unions don't mind *PRO*-1 spreading *T*-2, for their own narrow purposes.
It is also the kind of libel 0 politicians find *T*-1 useful, since it helps them *PRO*-2 strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.
But there is not one shred of evidence that, other things being equal, salary differentials result in educational differentials.
If there were such evidence, you can be sure 0 you would have heard of it.
If we wish *PRO*-4 to be serious about American education, we know exactly what *PRO* to do *T*-2--and, just as important, what *PRO* not to do *T*-3.
There are many successful schools scattered * throughout this nation, some of them in the poorest of ghettos, and they are all sending us the same message.
Conversely, there are the majority of unsuccessful schools, and we know which efforts at educational reform *T*-2 are doomed *-1 beforehand.
We really do know all 0 we need *-2 to know *T*-1, if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking.
In this respect, it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute, rather than eloquently "concerned."
They are inevitably inclined *PRO*-2 to echo the conventional pap, since this is the least controversial option that *T*-1 is open to them.
Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that "this country needs a comprehensive child - development policy for children under five."
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem *-1 to be a more pressing need.
What Gov. Clinton is advocating *T*-1, in effect, is *PRO* extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years.
Whether *PRO*-1 desirable or not, this is a child - care program, not an educational program.
We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade, but afterward the difference is quickly washed *-1 away.
*PRO* Let us sum up what we do know *T*-2 about education and about those education reforms that *T*-1 do work and don't work:--"Parental involvement" is a bad idea.
Parents are too likely *-1 to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children.
Parents should be involved with their children's education at home, not in school.
They should see to it that their kids don't play truant; they should make certain that the children spend enough time 0 *PRO* doing homework *T*-1; they should scrutinize the report card.
If parents are dissatisfied *-1 with a school, they should have the option of *PRO*-2 switching to another.
-- "Community involvement" is an even worse idea.
Here, the experience of New York City is decisive.
Locally elected school boards, especially in our larger cities, become the prey of ambitious, generally corrupt, and invariably demagogic local politicians or *PRO* would - be politicians.
New York is in the process of *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to disengage itself from a 20 - year - old commitment to this system of school governance, even as Chicago and other cities are moving *PRO*-3 to institute it.
-- In most states, *PRO* increasing expenditures on education, in our current circumstances, will probably make things worse, not better.
The reason is simple: Education takes place in the classroom, where the influence of money is minimal *T*-1.
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils--though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons.
The new money flows into the already top - heavy administrative structure, which *T*-1 busies itself *PRO*-2 piling more and more paper work on the teachers.
There is neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditures (in real terms) have increased sharply in the past quarter - of - a - century--we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world--educational performance has declined.
That is the way 0 the system works *T*-1.
-- Students should move up the educational ladder as their academic potential allows.
No student should be permitted *-3 *PRO*-4 to be graduated *-1 from elementary school without *PRO* having mastered the 3 R's at the level that *T*-2 prevailed 20 years ago.
This means "tracking," whose main purpose *T*-1 is less *PRO* to permit the gifted youngsters *PRO*-2 to flourish (though that is clearly desirable) than *PRO* to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for *PRO* entering the modern world of work.
The notion that tracking is somehow "undemocratic" is absurd.
The purpose of education is *PRO* to encourage young men and women *PRO*-1 to realize their full academic potential.
No one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential.
-- It *EXP*-6 is generally desirable *PRO* to use older textbooks--many of them, alas, out of print--rather than newer ones.
The latter are modish, trendy, often downright silly, and at best insubstantial.
They are based *-1 on dubious psychological and sociological theories rather than on educational experience.
One of the reasons 0 American students do so poorly in math tests *T*-1, as compared with British, French, German or Japanese students, is the influence of the "New Math" on American textbooks and teaching methods.
Anyone who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-3 to appreciate just how bizarre this situation *ICH*-5 is *T*-4--with students who *T*-2 can't add or subtract "learning" the conceptual basis of mathematical theory--should read the article by Caleb Nelson (himself a recent math major at Harvard) in the November American Spectator.
-- Most important of all, schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty, the curriculum, and all matters of student discipline.
Study after study--the most recent from the Brookings Institution--tells us that the best schools are those that *T*-1 are free of outside interference and are governed *-2 by a powerful head.
With that authority, of course, goes *T*-1 an unambiguous accountability.
Schools that *T*-2 are structured *-1 in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance.
This is a fact--though, in view of all the feathers that *T*-9 are ruffled *-8 by this fact, it *EXP*-7 is not surprising that one hears so little about it.
Mr. Kristol, an American Enterprise Institute fellow, co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The National Interest.
Japan's Big Four securities firms posted first - half unconsolidated results that *T*-1 mirrored softer performance as a result of slower turnover on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during July and August.
Figures for the period ended Sept. 30 for the four largest brokerage firms--Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities Co. and Nikko Securities--also reflected a changeover to a fiscal year ending March 31, replacing the 12 - month term formerly finishing Sept. 30.
As a result, brokerage house officials said 0 *?*, appropriate comparisons from the same period a year earlier were unavailable.
Operating profit, pretax profit and net income results, however, were provided *-1 for the immediately preceding six - month period.
The statistics follow a year - on - year rebound in consolidated and unconsolidated results in the full fiscal year ended in March 1989, *PRO*-1 recovering from dismal results in the prior fiscal year as a result of the October 1987 stock market crash.
Nomura said 0 its pretax profits inched up 0.9% to 248.91 billion yen (US$1.75 billion *U*) from 246.60 billion yen in the six months ended March 31.
Total operating profit fell 3.1% to 486.1 billion yen from 501.61 billion yen.
Net income, however, rose 3.7% to 107.87 billion yen from 103.98 billion yen.
Per - share net rose to 55.10 yen from 54.51 yen.
Daiwa said 0 its pretax profits surged 9.6% to 171.04 billion yen from 156.12 billion yen in the preceding six - month term.
Operating profit rose 5.5% to 332.38 billion yen from 315.12 billion yen.
Net income jumped 21% to 79.03 billion yen from 65.53 billion yen.
Per - share net rose to 62.04 yen from 51.50 yen.
Yamaichi said 0 its pretax profit increased 8.9% to 117.94 billion yen from 108.28 billion yen.
Operating profit rose 5.3% to 279.75 billion yen from 265.79 billion yen.
Net income surged 21% to 55.59 billion yen from 46.02 billion yen.
Per - share net rose to 47.46 yen from 39.31 yen.
Nikko's pretax profit rose 1.6% to 130.25 billion yen from 128.19 billion yen.
Operating profit rose 4% to 293.29 billion yen from 282.08 billion yen.
Net income rose 23% to 63.52 billion yen from 51.65 billion yen.

Copper futures sold off sharply yesterday, *PRO*-1 influenced *-2 by declines in the stock market and dollar, and a rally in bonds.
December copper opened near Monday's close, tried *PRO*-1 to rally but failed, and then triggered *PRO* stop - loss orders on its way down *PRO*-1 to settle at $1.1510 *U* a pound, off 4.50 cents for the day.
*PRO* Stop - loss orders are placed *-1 previously with instructions *PRO* to execute them if the market hits a predetermined price.
William Kaiser, president of the Kaiser Financial Group in Chicago, said 0 the decline was almost certainly influenced *-2 by the early sell - off in the stock market, which *T*-1 partly reflected a weakening economy.
He said 0 the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing.
Mr. Kaiser said 0 traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets, which *T*-1 became noticeably weaker two to three weeks ago.
But though a weakening economy implies reduced demand, Mr. Kaiser said that Third World copper - producing countries haven't any choice but *PRO* to sell copper.
They might even step up sales in a falling market, he said 0 *?*, in an effort *PRO* to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their treasuries.
Technically, Mr. Kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $1.24 to $1.26 *U* range *T*-1, *PRO*-2 thinking 0 there was support at the $1.20 *U* level.
When the market fell below that level on Monday and then yesterday couldn't climb above that level *T*-1, traders started *-2 selling out their positions.
Betty Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential - Bache Securities in New York, agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature.
She said 0 the market hit the $1.18 *U* level *ICH*-1 at around 10 a.m. EDT where it encountered a large number of *PRO* stop - loss orders *T*-2.
More *PRO* stop - loss orders were touched *-1 off all the way down to below $1.14 *U*, where modest buying was attracted *-2 *T*-3.
Ms. Raptopoulos said 0 the settling of strikes in Canada and Mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year.
She thinks 0 the next area of support for copper is in the $1.09 to $1.10 *U* range.
"I believe that as soon as the selling abates somewhat we could see a rally back to the $1.20 *U* region," she added *T*-1.
She thinks 0 a recovery in the stock market would help copper *PRO*-1 rebound as well.
She noted that the preliminary estimate of the third - quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected *-1 to be up about 2.5% to 3%.
"If the number is a little better, then copper will respond positively, if it is worse then more selling could ensue," she predicted *T*-1.
Ms. Raptopoulos noted that *PRO* relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky.
Yesterday, for example, "the durable goods numbers came out for September and the number was down only 0.1%," she said *T*-1.
"However, if you exclude defense - related orders then durable goods were down 3.9%.
I believe 0 that number reflects a slowing economy."
She said 0 copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next Tuesday.
However, David Threlkeld, president of Threlkeld & Co., an international metals company, noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of 1988, and that projected production is below last year.
Mr. Threlkeld said 0 the copper market seems *-1 to be anticipating a recession in three months, with declining use being the result.
"But," he added *?*, "we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years."
He noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about 3.5 weeks.
He said 0 the normal ratio is five to six weeks.
According to Mr. Threlkeld, the bottleneck in copper production isn't at the mines but at the copper refineries.
"It *EXP*-1 takes three months *PRO* to turn copper concentrate into cathodes," he said *T*-2.
If there isn't a recession, he said 0 *?*, "we will be out of copper by the end of March.
If there is a recession that will change the statistical situation."
He thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $1.65 *U* a pound, which *T*-2 was reached *-1 last year.
In the past Mr. Threlkeld has been known *-1 to have substantial long positions that is, he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices--in the copper futures market.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
ENERGY: The attitude was "*PRO* wait - and - see" in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before *PRO* ending the session four cents lower at $19.72 *U* a barrel for December delivery.
Several analysts and brokers said 0 the petroleum market was ready *PRO*-1 to rally after two days of price declines from profit - taking.
But an early 80 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average stopped the crude rally *PRO* cold.
The industrial average recovered *PRO*-1 to close only 3.69 points lower, but petroleum futures never shook off the chill.
Most market participants said 0 they were looking to this week's inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute *PRO*-1 to give the market some direction.
The report isn't generally available until late on Tuesdays.
PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading.
December gold was up $3.20 *U* an ounce at $373.40 *U*; December silver gained 5.7 cents to $5.1950 *U* an ounce.
January platinum rose $2.30 *U* an ounce to $488.60 *U*.
Mr. Kaiser said 0 there were no fundamental factors moving these markets.
He noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of Soviet sales of precious metals 0 *T*-1 to finance grain purchases, but the sales don't seem *-2 to have materialized.
Ms. Raptopoulos thought 0 yesterday's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar.
"Gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty prevails in the financial markets as it did *?*" yesterday *T*-1, she said *T*-2.
Mr. Kaiser noted that gold was more than 71 times the price of silver *ICH*-1 at the close yesterday, which *T*-2 is historically high.
"The high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a half - industrial metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy," he said *T*-1.
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather.
The sale to the Chinese government of 330,000 metric tons of wheat under the government's export enhancement program was announced *-1 after the close of trading Monday, but the sale was expected *RNR*-3 and failed *RNR*-3 *PRO*-2 to buoy prices yesterday, said 0 *T*-4 Dale Gustafson, a futures analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
As for other export customers, the Soviet Union isn't expected *-1 to be back buying U.S. corn in significant amounts until early next year, he said 0 *T*-2.
A number of commercial grain users buttressed that opinion yesterday by *PRO* buying certain corn options for delivery in March, *PRO* indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options *PRO*-1 to hedge against expected corn sales in next year's first quarter.
COCOA: Futures at first continued the rally begun * on Monday, but then faltered and closed lower.
The December contract opened just under Monday's close, triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $1,030 *U* a metric ton, *PRO* pushing the price to $1,040 *U*, and then encountered heavy selling by traders who *T*-1 buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests.
The contract settled at $1,014 *U* a ton, off $13 *U*.
Robert Hafer, senior commodities analyst at Kaiser Financial Group, said 0 Monday's rally continued yesterday for only about 20 minutes after the opening.
He said 0 even though there was arbitrage buying in New York because of the weak dollar, cocoa fell to relentless pressure from bearish traders.
But he noted that speculators apparently don't believe 0 there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa.
The December contract reached its life - of - contract low of $975 *U* a ton on Oct. 11; its lifetime high was $1,735 *U*, set * in 1988, and its recent high was $1,368 *U*, set * in early August.
The last time 0 cocoa traded at prices as low as currently *T*-1 was in 1974.
But while further modest declines might be ahead, Mr. Hafer said 0 it *EXP*-2 would be difficult *PRO* to get through resistance levels just above yesterday's high.
Bausch & Lomb Inc. said 0 its pharmaceuticals subsidiary agreed *PRO*-1 to supply collagen corneal shields for animal eye surgery to a unit of International Minerals & Chemical Corp.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The agreement marks Bausch & Lomb's first venture selling its eye care products for use by veterinarians.
The collagen corneal shield helps speed healing of the cornea after eye surgery.
The product will be distributed *-1 by Pitman - Moore Inc., a subsidiary of International Minerals.
Birtcher Corp. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement with C.R. Bard Inc., a Murray Hill, N.J., maker of health - care products, for the purchase of the company's Bard / EMS Electrosurgery division for about $11 million *U*.
Birtcher, a maker of electronic medical equipment, said 0 the transaction is expected *-1 to close on or before Nov. 30.
Bard / EMS had 1988 sales of about $14 million *U*, Birtcher said 0 *T*-1.
The Food and Drug Administration banned all imports of mushrooms from China in response to a rash of food - poisoning outbreaks linked * to canned Chinese mushrooms.
"The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom - processing industry in China," an FDA spokesman said *T*-1 yesterday.
The agency won't allow mushrooms that *T*-2 were canned *-3 or packed *-3 in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until "satisfactory sanitation - control measures *ICH*-4 are implemented *-1 in China *PRO* to prevent" bacterial contamination.
On May 19, the FDA began *-1 detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68 - ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania became ill from *PRO*-2 eating tainted mushrooms.
In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller - size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated *-2.
The outbreaks were traced *-1 to staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that *T*-2 produces a toxin capable of *PRO* surviving the high temperatures used * in *PRO* canning vegetables.
A recall of the mushrooms blamed * for the food poisoning began in early March.
In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued * at $47 million *U*, to the U.S. .
The shipments went mostly to food - service distributors that *T*-1 supply pizzerias and restaurants.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy here said that the Beijing government has taken "many effective measures" *PRO* to stop the mushroom contamination and is further investigating the underlying causes.
He predicted 0 the problem will be solved *-1 "very soon."
Staar Surgical Co.'s board said that it has removed Thomas R. Waggoner as president and chief executive officer and that John R. Wolf, formerly executive vice president, sales and marketing, has been named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive officer.
Mr. Waggoner has been involved in a dispute with the board since August, when he ousted all the directors *T*-1.
Later they said 0 they fired him, and two directors attempted *PRO*-1 to place the company under bankruptcy - law protection.
A federal judge turned down the Chapter 11 petition.
The company's latest announcement said 0 Mr. Waggoner will remain a director of Staar, a maker of products for small - incision surgery.
Mr. Wolf and other members of the board declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the announcement.
Mr. Waggoner couldn't be reached *-1.
The Staar board also said that John R. Ford resigned as a director, and that Mr. Wolf was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a member of the board.
CONTROL DATA Corp. said 0 it is offering *PRO*-3 to purchase the $154.2 million *U* amount of its 12 3/4% senior notes due June 15, 1991 *ICH*-2, at par, plus accrued *ICH*-1 interest to the Dec. 8 purchase date.
The Minneapolis computer systems and services concern said 0 the offer is required *-1 under the senior note indenture as a result of Control Data's recent sale of its disk drive subsidiary, Imprimis, to Seagate Technology Inc.
MINORITY RECRUITING has yet *-1 to meet hopes raised * by Bush administration.
Six months ago, as some personnel specialists saw it, a perception that President Bush really cared about fair employment--after what they said 0 *T*-1 was eight years of Reagan - era neglect--was prodding top management *PRO*-2 to raise hiring goals for females, blacks and other minorities.
The perception lingers, says 0 *T*-1 an official at a major industrial company.
But so far, he declares 0 *?*, there's little evidence 0 the "new urgency" is trickling down to the managers who *T*-1 actually do hiring.
"Is there really a commitment or an illusion of activity?" he asks *T*-1.
The recruiting "hasn't materialized," asserts 0 *T*-2 Jeffrey Christian, who *T*-1 runs a search agency.
Samuel Hall, Howard University's placement director, also doesn't see it.
And he questions the White House dedication.
"I don't think 0 the Bush administration has done anything," he says *T*-1.
Recruiter Donald Clark does note an increase in searches for minority candidates.
But some of the activity, he says 0 *?*, may reflect a rush 0 *T*-2 to get "numbers in order" for end - of - year reports.
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE hangs mostly on boss's subjective view.
Du Pont Co. in a couple of units has installed objective tests based * on earnings or return on equity.
Many companies have set up machinery 0 *T*-1 to assure workers a fair shake.
At most firms, though, it's the immediate supervisor who *T*-2 decides the merit increases 0 subordinates will be paid *-1 *T*-3.
Managers have "some very broad discretion," says 0 *T*-1 an official at Walt Disney Co.
Unocal Corp.'s top management sets guidelines, but line supervisors slice up the merit pie.
Lotus Development Corp. feeds its evaluations into a computer, but only for storage; the decisions are made *-1 by supervisors.
Hershey Foods Corp. strives for fairness by *PRO*-1 basing increases on quarterly reviews, annual appraisals and meetings with workers.
At Chemfix Technology Inc., each supervisor's recommendation must be approved *-1 by the next boss up the line, and then sanctioned *-1 by a salary review committee.
JAPANESE COMPANIES fare best in U.S. when they give Americans more say *T*-1.
University of Michigan researchers find 0 the companies earn more and win a bigger market share when their American employees get a voice in planning, product development and design, including decision - making back in Japan *T*-1.
"You can't hire competent Americans and say, ` *PRO* Let them run only their own show,"' says *T*-2 Vladimir Pucik, who *T*-1 headed the study run * with Egon Zehnder International, a search firm.
The researchers say 0 many Japanese companies err in the U.S. by *PRO*-1 adopting the American practice of *PRO* hiring managers on the "open market."
In Japan, by contrast, companies tend *-1 to develop their own talent and promote from within.
The Japanese also are accused *-1 of *PRO*-1 keeping their cards too close to their vests.
"Some Japanese executives are not yet...comfortable about *PRO*-1 sharing strategic information with their American colleagues," the researchers say *T*-2.
Americans stay longer *ICH*-1 with Japanese firms than American companies.
But they think 0 promotions are limited.
THE HOUSE votes down a proposal 0 *T*-1 to put pension plans under the control of joint labor - management boards.
Some consultants had insisted 0 it wouldn't work.

It's the first time in the survey's 15 years that the over - 50 group came out ahead *T*-1.
FEAR OF AIDS hinders hiring at few hospitals.
Dedication runs *PRO*-1 high.
Wafaa El - Sadr, who *T*-1 heads the AIDS program at New York City's Harlem Hospital Center, can't find help.
"I've been recruiting every single day since it *ICH*-2's been identified *-1 that many AIDS patients come from the inner city," she says *T*-3.
She was the only staff physician available *PRO*-1 to treat AIDS patients last summer and now she has the help of only two doctors part time.
Part of the problem, though, may reflect a general unwillingness *PRO* to work with the urban poor.
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas says 0 it hasn't had any problem *-1 recruiting, even after a nurse contracted the virus while *PRO*-2 injecting an AIDS patient.
"I can tell you that nobody quit over it.
No one panicked," a spokeswoman says *T*-1.
St. Paul Medical Center, also in Dallas, sees only a "minimal erosion" of support staff due to AIDS.
Yale - New Haven Hospital sees no problem, says 0 *T*-1 John Fenn, the chief of staff.
"There are enough enlightened and spirited individuals who *T*-1 know their responsibilities," he says *T*-2.
THE CHECKOFF: At least somebody gains on layoffs.
The Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms says 0 the industry's volume has soared tenfold since 1980, to $350 million *U* a year....
And somebody loses on the expected repeal of Section 89, the benefits test fought * by most employers.
Triad Solutions says 0 software producers had each invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that now *T*-1 have no use.
Your Sept. 26 "Politics & Policy" article about William Bennett's Emergency Drug Plan for Washington gives the impression that the FBI has not been *RNR*-2 nor is *RNR*-2 actively involved.
This is not the case.
The FBI is very supportive of *RNR*-2 and an active participant in *RNR*-2 Mr. Bennett's initiative.
It was agreed *-1 at the outset of the Washington Drug Initiative that the FBI's role would be *PRO* to continue *-2 targeting the major drug traffickers through our National Drug Strategy.
Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user, but rather we target and attack major drug - trafficking organizations that *T*-1 control a large segment of the drug market.
The trial of Raful Edmond III in Washington serves *PRO*-1 to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved * through our excellent working relationship with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).
The FBI's role is *PRO* to complement the D.C. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations, but also by *PRO* providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug - related crimes.
In fact, we have agents assigned * full time *PRO*-1 to assist the MPD in drug - related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence.

FRANKLIN NATIONAL BANK DIED at 3 p.m. EDT, Oct. 8, 1974, and was promptly resurrected *-1 under new owners *PRO* to shore up confidence in other banks during a recession.
Arthur Burns, Federal Reserve Board chairman, said 0 the government's "luck" in *PRO* keeping the bank *PRO*-1 open--despite *PRO* being the then - biggest U.S. bank failure--prevented "shock waves around the country and around the world."
Federal officials who *T*-1 had been probing the bank for months arranged a merger with European - American Bank & Trust, owned * by six foreign banks, 0 *T*-2 to avert the closedown.
And federal insurance protected the bank's 631,163 depositors.
The crisis had peaked on May 10, 1974, when the bank disclosed "severe" foreign - exchange losses due to "unauthorized" trading *T*-1.
Massive withdrawals followed and there was a brief rescue attempt, with political undertones, including $1.77 billion *U* in Federal Reserve loans.
Within six years many figures were convicted *-1 for their illegal abuse of Franklin funds.
In June 1980, Michele Sindona--an Italian financier who in July 1972 *T*-3 had bought a 22% block of Franklin's stock from Loews Corp., headed * by Laurence A. Tisch--was sentenced *-1 to 25 years in prison after *PRO* being convicted *-2 of fraud and perjury.
Included *-2 was *T*-1 the charge that Sindona siphoned $45 million *U* of Franklin funds for his other ventures.
(Sindona in 1979 faked his "kidnapping" for 2 1/2 months *PRO*-1 to delay his trial.)
During 1976 to 1979, other former Franklin officials either pleaded guilty to *RNR*-1 or were found *-2 guilty of *RNR*-1 violations including phony transactions 0 *T*-3 to hide the bank's losses.
Sindona, the onetime Vatican financial adviser with reported links to the Mafia, died on March 22, 1986, at age 65, reportedly after *PRO*-1 drinking cyanide - laced coffee in an Italian prison.
It happened four days after he was sentenced *-1 to life in prison for *PRO*-1 ordering a 1979 murder.
Italian magistrates labeled his death *PRO*-1 a suicide.
Residents of this city soon will be seeing ads urging them *PRO*-1 to visit "Cleveland's outdoor museum"--Lake View Cemetery.
Despite such famous tenants as oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, Lake View Cemetery has fallen on hard times.
So the inner - city burial ground is trying *PRO*-1 to resurrect itself with a television advertising campaign.
The ads celebrate the achievements of some of Lake View's residents.
A spot honoring Bill White, the inventor of chewing gum, shows a woman trying *PRO*-1 to extricate her high - heeled shoe from a wad of gum.
Another focuses on Charles Brush, the first person 0 *T*-1 to light a city electrically.
It shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp.
Street lights, the ad points out 0 *?*, "helped *PRO* sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player."
Cemetery officials hope 0 the ads, which *T*-1 will begin *-2 airing next month, will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions.
Lake View had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as an out - of - repair and crime - infested cemetery.
The private, non-profit cemetery has had trouble *-2 competing against its for - profit counterparts, which *T*-1 use direct mail and other advertising *PRO*-3 to sell lots.
"We don't want *PRO*-2 to be known *-1 as ambulance chasers," says *T*-3 William Garrison, Lake View's president.
"We want people to think of Lake View as an historical park and educational experience....
A pleasant place 0 *PRO* to come and spend a few hours *T*-1."
Not all of the cemetery's better - known tenants lend themselves to the promotional job at hand, however.
For example, President James A. Garfield *ICH*-1 is entombed *-2 here, the victim of an assassination in 1881.
(Mr. Garrison notes, however, that the Garfield tomb is one of the nation's premier examples of Romanesque architecture.)
Mr. Rockefeller, buried * beneath a 180 - foot - tall granite obelisk, didn't seem *-1 right for an ad either.
The oil magnate, who *T*-1 spent his later years *PRO*-3 passing out dimes *PRO*-4 to counter his penny - pinching image, "isn't terribly amusing," says 0 *T*-5 Barry Olson, creative director at Innis - Maggiore - Olson, Canton, Ohio, which *T*-2 is producing the ads.
But there are plenty of other promising prospects *ICH*-3 at Lake View, promoters believe 0 *T*-2: Ernest Ball, for instance, who *T*-1 wrote "When Irish Eyes are Smiling *T*-4," and Garrett Morgan, the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light.
*PRO* Remember those bulky, thick - walled refrigerators of 30 years ago?
They, or at least something less efficient than today's thin - walled units, may soon be making a comeback.
That something, whatever it is *T*-2, could add as much as $100 *U* to the $600 *U* or so 0 consumers now pay *T*-1 for lower - priced refrigerators.
These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called * *PRO*-1 the Montreal Protocol, signed * by 24 nations in 1987.
In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date--involving products with an annual value of $135 billion *U* in the U.S. alone--the signatories agreed *PRO*-1 to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
World - wide production would be cut *-1 in half by 1998.
The U.S. Senate liked the treaty so well 0 it ratified it by a vote of 89 to 0.
*PRO*-2 Not to be outdone *-1, George Bush wants CFCs banished * altogether by the year 2000, a goal endorsed * at an 80 - nation U.N. environmental meeting in Helsinki in the spring.
That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out.
CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas, often referred to * by the Du Pont trade name Freon, which *T*-2 is compressed *-1 to liquid form *PRO* to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air - conditioning equipment.
Gases containing CFCs are pumped *-1 into polyurethane *PRO* to make the foam used * in pillows, upholstery and insulation.
Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which *T*-2 accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were *?* back in the days when they were insulated *-1 with glass fiber *T*-3 *T*-4.
But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $100 billion *U* between now and the year 2000 *PRO* to convert to other coolants, foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes, the Montreal Protocol's legions of supporters say 0 it is worth it.
They insist that CFCs are damaging the earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which *T*-1 screens out some of the sun's ultraviolet rays.
Hence, as they see it, if something isn't done *-1 earthlings will become ever more subject to sunburn and skin cancer.
Peter Teagan, a specialist in heat transfer, is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., 0 *T*-2 to find alternative technologies that *T*-1 will allow industry to eliminate CFCs.
In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming, a theory that mankind's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a "greenhouse effect" that *T*-1 will work important climatic changes in the earth's atmosphere over time.
"I would be the first 0 *T*-1 to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems," says *T*-2 Mr. Teagan.
"In the kind of literature 0 I read *T*-1 I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently.
But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel 0 it has *-2 to be addressed *-1 soon, before all the evidence is in.
We can't afford *PRO*-1 to wait."
But does it have *-1 to be so soon?
Some atmospheric scientists think that even if CFCs were released *-1 into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate, the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10% by the middle of the next century.
It *EXP*-1's easy *PRO* to get something comparable by *PRO* simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S. .
Moreover, there are questions, particularly among atmospheric scientists who *T*-1 know this subject best, about the ability *ICH*-2 of anyone *PRO* to know what in fact *T*-3 is happening to the ozone layer.
It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere *T*-1, the chlorine in them is capable of *PRO*-2 interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone *T*-3.
But ozone creation is a very large - scale natural process and the importance of human - generated CFCs in *PRO* reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture.
The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard *PRO* to measure *?*.
What scientists have known *T*-2 since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that *T*-1 expands or contracts from year to year.
But it *EXP*-1 is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in Antarctica.
Moreover, surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems, *PRO*-1 running for many years without either the CFC gas or the insulation ever escaping.
Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available, why not use them?
Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none, so far, match the nonflammable, nontoxic CFCs.
Butane and propane can be used *-1 as coolants, for example, but are flammable.
Moreover, new lubricants will be needed *-1 *PRO* to protect compressors from the new formulations, which, as with CFCs, *T*-3 are solvents.
Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed * *PRO* to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices, energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect.
Folks in the Midwest who *T*-1 just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was *T*-2 when they needed it *T*-3, but *PRO* let's not be flippant about grave risks.
As it happens, Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in *PRO* throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories.
It is interested in *PRO*-1 making some money *PRO*-2 advising industry on how *PRO* to convert to a world without CFCs *T*-3.
There is, after all, big money in environmentalism.
Maybe we should ask why it was *T*-1 that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement *ICH*-3, giving it wide publicity, that it was withdrawing CFCs *T*-2.
Freon, introduced * in 1930, revolutionized America by *PRO*-1 making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all.
One answer is that big companies are growing weary of *PRO* fighting environmental movements and are trying instead *PRO*-1 to cash in on them, although they never care *PRO*-2 to put it quite that way.
Du Pont, as it happens, has a potential substitute for CFCs.
Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one, and is building a plant in Louisiana 0 *T*-1 to produce it.
Japanese chemical companies are at work *PRO*-1 developing their own substitutes and hoping *PRO*-2 to conquer new markets, of course.
There are still others who *T*-1 don't mind *PRO*-2 seeing new crises arise.
Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able *PRO*-1 to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money 0 *PRO* to fight it *T*-2.
University professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services evaporate when price decontrol destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for "alternative energy *T*-1."
They needed new crises *PRO* to generate new grants and contracts.
In other words, environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that *T*-1 fare better when there are many problems *T*-2 than when there are few *T*-3.
That tends *-1 to tilt the public debate toward "solutions" even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency *T*-2.
There is an element of make - work involved *-1.
Consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a refrigerator or an air - conditioned car.
If they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster, the price would be cheap.
But if there is no impending threat, it can get *PRO*-1 to be very expensive.
BSB BANCORP Inc., Binghamton, N.Y., said 0 it increased its regular quarterly dividend 50%, to 15 cents a share from 10 cents.
It is payable Dec. 10 to stock of record Nov. 24.
The move was made *-1 because of the bank - holding company's increased profitability, officials said 0 *T*-2.
In the third quarter, BSB earned $2 million *U*, up from $1.8 million *U* a year earlier.
In national over - the - counter trading yesterday, BSB closed at $17.50 *U*, up 12.5 cents.
BSB has 3.1 million shares outstanding.
Genetic Defect Spotted *-1 In 3 - Day - Old Embryo
RESEARCHERS diagnosed a genetic defect in a three - day - old mouse embryo in an experiment directly applicable to humans.
Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today.
But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows 0 genetic defects can be detected *-1 three days after conception *PRO* using a new American - developed gene - copying technique.
The experiment, applicable to many genetic disorders, involved beta - thalassemia, a severe blood anemia resulting from a missing hemoglobin gene.
It's an inherited human disorder that *T*-2's been duplicated *-1 in mice.
In the experiment, mice with the defective gene were mated *-1.
Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted *-2 in the uterus, it was washed *-1 out of the mother mouse.
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells.
One cell was teased *-1 out, and its DNA extracted *-2.
*PRO*-2 Using the new technique developed * by Cetus Corp., called * *PRO*-4 the polymerase chain reaction, the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that *T*-1 ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene, *PRO*-2 providing enough copies 0 *PRO* to test *T*-3.
A genetic probe showed 0 the hemoglobin gene was missing, the researchers report 0 *T*-1 in the medical journal Lancet.
In the report, two molecular biologists suggest 0 such embryo diagnosis can be used *-1 by couples at high risk of *PRO* passing a genetic defect to a child.
For example, infertile couples who *T*-1 have the woman's eggs fertilized *-2 in the test tube usually have several eggs *ICH*-4 fertilized *-3 at a time.
When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells *T*-2, a single cell from each embryo can be tested *-1 for genetic defects.
A healthy embryo can be picked *-1 for implantation and defective ones discarded *-2.
Or in other couples, the embryo could be temporarily taken *-1 out and tested *-1 three days after conception and returned *-1 if *PRO*-1 healthy, or discarded *-1 if not.
Yeast Adapted *-1 *PRO* to Make Gene - Spliced Drugs
AN OIL COMPANY finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast.
In the early 1970s, when the "world food crisis" was a major worry *T*-1, Phillips Petroleum Co., like several other big companies, began *-2 developing "single - cell protein," edible protein made * by microbes feeding on non-edible materials.
Phillips found and improved a yeast, "Pichia pastoris," which *T*-1 made protein from natural gas - derived alcohol.
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein.
Single - cell protein never panned out, and most companies abandoned such research.
But Phillips persisted, *PRO*-1 calling in scientists from the Salk Institute.
They've now adapted the yeast to *PRO* making genetically engineered drugs.
Like the bacteria used * by genetic engineers, the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use.
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus.
Thus, the proteins from the yeast are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria.
The oil company claims 0 its yeast system also is better than bacteria at high - volume production of genetically engineered drugs.
Chiron Corp., an Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology firm, is seeing if the Phillips yeast can be used *-1 *PRO* to make its genetically engineered human proteins.
*PRO* Peeking Inside Arteries From Outside the Body
*PRO* VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without *PRO* poking catheters into the body may come out of research at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
Strokes, heart attacks, leg pains (intermittent claudication) and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol - rich deposits.
At present, doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged *-1 *T*-3 only by *PRO*-4 inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that *T*-2 makes the arteries visible on X-rays.
A non-invasive method is being researched *-1 by biophysicist Lynn Jelinski at the AT&T unit.
It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when *PRO* subjected *-1 to an intense magnetic field *T*-2.
It's the same phenomenon used * in the new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners being used * in hospitals in place of X-ray scans.
In the Bell Labs experiments, an MRI - type of machine, synchronized * with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram, rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel.
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a "*PRO* stop - motion" movie of the blood - filled vessel, (like the "*PRO* stop - motion" seen *PRO* in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing *T*-1).
The scientists have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats.
They've been able *PRO*-1 to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood, a first for such tiny blood vessels, they report 0 *T*-2 in Nature, a scientific journal.
They now are experimenting with *PRO* measuring blood flow.
The ultimate hope is that the technique could identify diseased vessels.
Odds and Ends
TESTS ON 2,800 - year - old mummies from Chile indicate 0 ancient wood fires didn't produce dioxins or dibenzofurans, *PRO* contradicting a theory 0 the two pollutants today are coming from wood burning, General Electric Co. reports 0 *T*-1 in Environmental Science & Technology magazine....
Almost 40% of schizophrenic men *ICH*-1 have an impaired sense of smell vs. fewer than 10% of schizophrenic women, reports 0 *T*-2 the American Journal of Psychiatry.
The estimates of real gross national product prepared * by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth.
Since the bureau's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated * by the Department of Labor, underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics.
If this thesis is correct, it has important implications for macroeconomic policies: It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts 0 *T*-1 to enact tax incentives and other measures 0 *T*-2 to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP.
It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the informed public generally, as to what *T*-1 constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability.
In the early 1980s, I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade.
This forecast was based *-1 on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces--such as demographic changes, the oil shock and accelerating inflation--that *T*-2 had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s.
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981.
But I had expected more, which *T*-1 is one reason 0 I began *-2 looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates.
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948 - 89 period, but all 0 I am claiming *T*-91 is that the growth trend is understated *-90.
(It *EXP*-1 is, however, possible, that further study will reveal increasing bias.)
This bias is in no way deliberate.
The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted * *PRO* to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data.
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in *PRO* assembling output data *T*-1.
This means that no allowance is made *-1 for possible increases in output per unit of labor.
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two - thirds of federal civilian employees *T*-1, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s.
Even if it is assumed *-1 that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average.
The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well.
Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears *-1 to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988.
Because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product, *PRO* missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year.
The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators 0 *T*-1 to adjust for price changes.
I estimate that these mismeasurements as *PRO* detailed *-1 by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product.
Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services.
In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted * for changes in performance characteristics was introduced *-1, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed *?*.
Since then, further research argues that failure *PRO* to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least 0.26 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate.
In sum, the biases ennumerated * above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP.
For the private domestic business economy, the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point.
In other words, the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated *-1 by about 20%.

Americans are drinking less, but young professionals from Australia to West Germany are rushing *PRO*-1 to buy premium - brand American vodka, brandy and other spirits.
In particular, many are snubbing the scotch preferred * by their parents and opting for bourbon, the sweet firewater from the Kentucky countryside.
With U.S. liquor consumption declining steadily, many American producers are stepping up their marketing efforts abroad.
And those efforts are paying off: Spirits exports jumped more than 2 1/2 times to $157.2 million *U* in 1988 from $59.8 million *U* in 1983, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., a trade group.
"Spirits companies now view themselves as global marketers," says *T*-1 Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing Corp., a research and consulting firm.
"If you want *PRO*-1 to be a player, you have *-2 to be in America, Europe and the Far East.
You must have world - class brands, a long - term perspective and deep pockets."
The internationalization of the industry has been hastened *-1 by foreign companies' acquisitions of many U.S. producers.
In recent years, for example, Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain acquired Heublein Inc., while another British company, Guinness PLC, took over United Distillers Group and Schenley Industries Inc.
But the shift has also been fueled *-1 by necessity.
While premium - brand spirits like Smirnoff vodka and Jack Daniel's whiskey are riding high in the U.S., domestic spirits consumption fell 15% to 141.1 million cases in 1988 from 166 million cases in 1979.
In recent years, growth has come in the foreign markets.
U.S. brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons, a standard industry measure, according to Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group, an industry association.
Exports of rum surged 54% to 814,000 proof gallons.
Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S. .
Japan, the world's third - largest liquor market after the U.S. and Britain, helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products *T*-1.
California wineries, benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies, are expanding aggressively into Japan, as well as Canada and Great Britain.
In Japan, the wineries are promoting their products' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs, whose recommendations *T*-1 carry weight.
In Australia, Britain, Canada and Greece, Brown - Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur.
*PRO*-1 Using cinema, television and print ads, the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South.
The biggest foreign inroads, though, have been made *-1 by bourbon.
While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from *PRO* making bourbon.
(All bourbon comes from Kentucky, though Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey often is counted *-1 as bourbon because of similarity of taste.)
Moreover, just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S., bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied * to frontier folklore.
How was the West won *T*-1?
With a six - shooter in one hand and bourbon in the other.
"We imagine with bourbon the Wild West, Western motion pictures and gunmen appearing," says *T*-1 Kenji Kishimoto, vice president of Suntory International Corp., a division of Suntory Ltd., Japan's largest liquor company.
Suntory distributes Brown - Forman bourbons in Japan.
Bourbon makes up just 1% of world - wide spirits consumption, but it represented 57% of U.S. liquor exports last year, according to Jobson; no other category had more than 19%.
Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market, which *T*-1 grew to $77 million *U* last year from $33 million *U* in 1987, according to government figures.
Jim Beam Brands Co., a division of American Brands Inc., is the leading exporter of bourbon and produces 10 other types of liquor.
The company says 0 it will increase its international advertising 35% in 1990, with bourbon representing most of that amount.
Guinness's Schenley Industries unit has increased its TV advertising in Japan and has built partnerships with duty - free shops throughout Asia, *PRO* enabling it *PRO*-1 to install prominent counter displays.
The company's I.W. Harper brand is the leading bourbon in Japan, with 40% of the market.
Bourbon exporters have succeeded in Japan where other industries have failed *T*-1, *PRO*-2 avoiding cultural hitches in marketing and distribution by *PRO*-3 allying themselves with local agents.
Jim Beam Brands has a distribution partnership with Nikka Whiskey Co., a distiller.
Seagram Co., which *T*-1 exports Four Roses bourbon, has such a link with Kirin Brewery Co.
Some bourbon makers advertise abroad as they do *?* at home.
*PRO*-1 To promote Jack Daniel's overseas, Brown - Forman uses the same photos of front porches from Lynchburg, Va., and avuncular old men in overalls and hightops.
Jim Beam print ads, however, strike different chords in different countries.
In Australia, land of the outback, a snapshot of Jim Beam lies on a strip of hand - tooled leather.
West Germans get glitz, with bourbon in the foreground and a posh Beverly Hills hotel in the background.

Big gains for the ultra-right Republicans party in Baden - Wuerttemburg state municipal elections Sunday showed eroding support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl in a traditional bastion for his Christian Democratic Union.
With ballots from most of the state's major cities in by yesterday morning, the Republicans came away with 10% of the vote in several of the key districts.
With many rural districts yet to report ballots, election officials estimate 0 support for Christian Democrats fell an average five percentage points statewide.
The left - of - center Social Democrats and the environmental Greens party posted mixed results.
*PRO*-1 Headed *-2 by a former Waffen SS sergeant and working from a nationalistic platform of anti-foreigner rhetoric, the fledgling Republicans party has scored surprising gains in earlier elections in the states of West Berlin, Hesse and North - Rhine Westphalia.
With West German unemployment remaining high at two million jobless and the lack of affordable housing becoming a primary issue for next year's campaign, the Republicans are seen *-1 drawing support for their "Germans First" stand on social - welfare issues.
Election analysts acknowledge that a "Red - Green" coalition of Social Democrats and Greens could edge out Chancellor Kohl's coalition in the December 1990 national election if support for the Republicans continues *-1 to spread.
International investigators urged Britain *PRO*-2 to allow prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals who *T*-1 took refuge there after 1945.
Under current law, such suspects are immune from prosecution for acts committed * while not *PRO* British citizens.
"If we're not careful we could become known as a haven for war criminals," said *T*-1 Jeff Rooker, a member of Parliament and one of several British politicians attending a London conference with government investigators from the U.S., Canada and Australia.
A parliamentary inquiry found in July that more than 70 people living in Britain could have been part of death squads that *T*-1 roamed Nazi - occupied Eastern Europe.
Parliament is expected *-1 to discuss next month whether *PRO*-2 to change the law.

In a sign of easing tension between Beijing and Hong Kong, China said 0 it will again take back illegal immigrants caught *PRO* *PRO*-1 crossing into the British colony.

Although Italy's investigation of whether Olivetti had violated Western export - control rules had previously been made *-1 known, this marked the first time 0 the unit and product were named *-2 *T*-3.
The U.S. is worried *-1 about the convertibility of Olivetti's machine tools to military use.
However, an Olivetti spokeswoman said 0 OCN - PPL, of which Olivetti sold the majority interest *T*-2 last year, "doesn't make equipment that *T*-1 has the type of precision necessary for sophisticated productions."
Conservationists say that drift - net fishing threatens *PRO*-1 to wipe out much of the world's tuna stocks in a few years.
But the Japanese Fisheries Association criticized moves *PRO* to ban the practice in international waters.
"It *EXP*-2 is really unfortunate for human beings to be swayed *-1 by emotional discussions," the association said *T*-3.
In driftnet, or "wall of death," fishing, fleets lay nets up to three miles long that *T*-1 trap almost everything in their path.
Earlier this year, Japan said 0 it would cut the number of its drift - net vessels in the South Pacific by two - thirds, or down to 20.
Workers at Peugeot S.A.'s car plant at Sochaux, in eastern France, voted *PRO*-2 to end a six - week - old strike that *T*-1 has cost the Peugeot group production of 60,000 automobiles, a company spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
The strikers voted *PRO*-2 to accept a series of management proposals that *T*-1 will give them a higher basic wage, better profit - sharing benefits and bigger annual bonuses.
The spokesman said 0 the vote at Sochaux is expected *-3 to be followed *-1 by a similar move at the company's assembly plant at Mulhouse, where the number of strikers has been whittled *-2 down to 80 *T*-4.
About 8,000 National Union of Mineworkers members resumed their strike against De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. after further negotiations *PRO* to settle a wage dispute broke down.
Striking workers, who *T*-1 began *-2 striking five diamond mines on Oct. 13, had returned to work last week when the union and De Beers arranged *PRO*-3 to reopen negotiations *T*-4.
A De Beers spokesman said yesterday 0 the company had offered *PRO*-1 to increase the minimum wage by 18%, while the union was demanding 26.6%.
Before the two parties resumed talks last week, De Beers offered 17% and the union wanted 37.6%.
China's People's Daily took note of the growing problem of computer fraud.
Since the first fraud was discovered *-1 in July 1986 at an office of the People's Bank of China in Shenzhen, 15 major cases have been found *-2, the paper said 0 *T*-3; the biggest was the theft of $235,000 *U* from a bank in Chengdu in March 1988.
The number of computers has mushroomed in recent years, with 10,000 in use, as well as 30,000 miniature models.
But security systems, effective management controls and regulations *PRO* to govern their use have not kept pace, the People's Daily said 0 *T*-1.
Besides money, criminals have also used computers *PRO*-2 to steal secrets and intelligence, the newspaper said 0 *T*-1, but it gave no more details.
Japanese tourists will be told *-1 *PRO*-2 to take care when *PRO* photographing earthquake damage in San Francisco *T*-4, the Japan Association of Travel Agents said 0 *T*-3.

Fatalities on rural interstates rose 33% between 1986 and last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said 0 *T*-1 in a report on the impact of the 65 miles - per - hour speed limit on those roads.
The report to Congress said that fatalities rose 18% in 1987 and 13% in 1988 on rural interstates.
The 1987 highway bill permitted states *PRO*-4 to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on interstate roads, which *T*-2 are defined *-1 as highways that *T*-3 pass through areas with fewer than 50,000 people.
Since 1987, 40 states have increased the speed limit on rural interstates.
"About one - third of the fatality increase is attributed *-1 to greater travel, and about two - thirds is attributed *-2 to other factors {primarily to greater speed}," according to NHTSA.
The report showed that deaths on urban interstate highways rose 7% between 1986 and last year, while fatalities on non-interstate roads were about the same in 1988 as in 1986.
In states that *T*-1 raised the speed limit on rural interstates, the fatality rate rose about 18% to 1.7 deaths per 100 million miles traveled * between 1986 and 1988.
In contrast, the fatality rate in the states that *T*-1 retained the 55 mph limit was 0.9 *ICH*-2 last year, the same as in 1986.

Ronald B. Koenig, 55 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a senior managing director of the Gruntal & Co. brokerage subsidiary of this insurance and financial - services firm.
Mr. Koenig will build the corporate - finance and investment - banking business of Gruntal, which *T*-1 has primarily been a retail - based firm.
He was chairman and co-chief executive officer of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. until July, when he was named *-1 *PRO*-4 co-chairman of the investment - banking firm along with Howard L. Blum Jr., who *T*-2 then became the sole chief executive *T*-3.
Yesterday, Mr. Blum, 41, said 0 he wasn't aware of plans *ICH*-1 at Ladenburg *PRO* to name a co-chairman 0 *T*-2 to succeed Mr. Koenig and said 0 the board would need *-3 to approve any appointments or title changes.
Mr. Blum added 0 he wasn't surprised 0 Mr. Koenig resigned, but his departure was "nothing that we desired *T*-1 or worked for *T*-1."
Mr. Koenig said: "I just got a tremendous offer from Gruntal.

Mr. Fried also is the managing partner of Albert Fried & Co.
The government said 0 it would streamline its enormous and often - criticized food marketing and distribution network, Compania Nacional de Subsistencias Populares, or Conasupo.
Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said 0 the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food - production plants and warehouses *PRO* beginning early next year.
The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products, *PRO*-1 maintaining production of the two most important ones, corn and milk.
Mr. Ovalle also said 0 Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods.
The agency's workers and private companies would be allowed *-1 to bid for the assets up for sale.
Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold *-1 at state - subsidized prices *T*-2.
Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste.
Private - sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring.
But most economists doubt 0 the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy, which *T*-1 largely goes *PRO*-2 to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk.
MCA Inc. said 0 its toy - making unit agreed *PRO*-1 to buy Buddy L Corp., producer of a line of toy vehicles and preschool products.
The price wasn't disclosed *-1, but an executive of LJN Toys Ltd., the MCA unit, said 0 the closely held Buddy L had annual sales in excess of $20 million *U*.

MCA said 0 it expects the proposed transaction to be completed *-2 "no later than Nov. 10.
Designer Sandra Garratt filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Code protection, *PRO*-2 saying that her cash flow had been cut *-1 off.
The designer, whose line of modular, one - size - fits - all clothing *T*-1 has spawned a host of clones, has been in a dispute with her latest licensee, Jerell Inc. for several months.
Ms. Garratt was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in March.
The designer's attorney, Molly Bartholow, said that Ms. Garratt was forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to start bankruptcy - law proceedings because Jerell began *-2 withholding her royalty payments last month.
Jerell paid Ms. Garratt royalties for the line known * as Multiples by Sandra Garratt, which *T*-2 are sold *-1 primarily through department stores.
Ms. Garratt sued the Dallas apparel maker earlier this year, *PRO*-1 charging that Jerell developed and marketed clothing lines fashioned * after her designs, in violation of their contract.
That lawsuit is still pending.
Jerell couldn't immediately be reached *-1 for comment.
Ms. Garratt's assets and liabilities weren't disclosed *-1.
The Justice Department said 0 it filed a lawsuit seeking more than $7.7 million *U* from a Meredith Corp. unit on charges that the company defrauded the government on a contract *PRO* to provide relocation services for federal employees.
The suit, filed * in federal trial court in Des Moines, Iowa, where Meredith is based *-1 *T*-3, alleges that the diversified media company's relocation unit cheated the government by *PRO*-2 misrepresenting the value of government employees' homes.
The government contract required Meredith Relocation Corp. *PRO*-1 to purchase employees' homes based on independent appraisals.
The Justice Department alleges that the company "engaged in various forms of misrepresentation" with the goal of *PRO*-1 reducing the appraised value of employees' homes.
In the suit, the department seeks *PRO*-1 to recover $7.7 million *U* in costs incurred * when the government terminated its contract with Meredith Relocation and sought other contracts 0 *T*-2 to replace it *T*-3.
The department also said 0 it seeks "three times the government's damages, which *T*-1 are presently undetermined, plus penalties."
Officials with Meredith didn't have any immediate comment on the suit.
The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door - to - door nationwide polls conducted * for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.
The two surveys, which *T*-1 asked different questions, were conducted *-2 *PRO* using national random probability samples.
The poll conducted * by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30, 1989.
The poll conducted * by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15, 1989.
Responses were weighted *-1 on the basis of age and gender *PRO*-1 to conform with U.S. Census data.
For each poll, the odds *ICH*-1 are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought *PRO*-2 to survey every household in the U.S. *PRO*-3 using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.
The margin of error for subgroups--for example, married women with children at home--would be larger.
In addition, in any survey, there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings.

Next to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's megabillion RJR Nabisco deal, SCI Television is small fry.
But the troubles of SCI TV are a classic tale of the leveraged buy - out excesses of the 1980s, especially the asset - stripping game.
SCI TV, which *T*-1 expects *PRO*-3 to release a plan *PRO* to restructure $1.3 billion *U* of debt in the next day or so, isn't just another LBO that *T*-2 went bad after *PRO* piling on debt--though it did do that.
The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO, a set of assets that *T*-1 were leveraged *-2 twice, *PRO* enabling the blue - chip buy - out king Henry Kravis in 1987 *PRO*-3 to take more than $1 billion *U* of cash out of the com - pany.
SCI TV's buy - out was an ace in the hole for Mr. Kravis and for investors in KKR partnerships.
But it has left holders of SCI TV's junk bonds *ICH*-1 *PRO*-4 holding the bag, including some heavyweights that KKR might need *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to finance future deals, such as Kemper Financial Services, First Executive, Columbia Savings & Loan and Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
Some junk - holders are said *-1 to be considering legal action against KKR or moves *PRO* to force SCI TV into bankruptcy court.
And KKR's majority partner in SCI TV's buy - out, Nashville, Tenn., entrepreneur George Gillett, also is said *-1 to be very unhappy.
SCI TV's six stations once were part of Storer Communications.
KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy - out, then later sold Storer's cable operations at a fat profit.
In 1987, KKR for the second time piled debt onto Storer's TV stations, *PRO*-2 selling them for $1.3 billion *U* to a new entity that *T*-1 was 45% - owned by KKR and 55% - owned by Gillett Corp., which now *T*-3 operates the SCI TV stations.
In this second LBO, KKR with one hand took more than $1 billion *U* of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations, *PRO* making them more valuable in a 1988 sale.
(Storer also took $125 million *U* of junior SCI TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets.)
With the other hand, KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10% of the cash 0 it had taken *T*-1 out, *PRO*-2 buying SCI TV common and preferred shares.
So, while KKR today has an estimated $250 million *U* *ICH*-1 sunk * in now - shaky SCI TV, including equity and debt, the LBO firm still is $1 billion *U* ahead on the SCI TV buy - out after *PRO* taking cash up front.
On Storer as a whole, KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60% in the three years 0 it owned Storer *T*-1.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gillett risks *PRO*-2 losing his entire equity investment of about $100 million *U* in SCI TV if the company can't be restructured *-1.
Overall, Mr. Gillett's holding company, Gillett Holdings, is heavily indebted and, except for its Vail Mountain resorts, isn't doing very well.
With the TV business falling on hard times in recent years, analysts say that if SCI TV had *-2 to be liquidated *-1 today, it might fetch 30% less than in the 1987 buy - out, *PRO* wiping out most of the company's junk - holders and its stockholders.
Meanwhile, SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill, and *PRO*-2 to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that *T*-1 have fallen *PRO*-3 due.
SCI TV's grace period for *PRO* paying its bills is due *-1 to expire Nov. 16.
It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan *PRO* to restructure debt.
Negotiations "have started con - structively, but that's not *PRO* to say 0 we like this particular offer," says *T*-1 Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., adviser to SCI TV junk - holders.
No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly.
But it's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed *-2 that Mr. Gillett didn't manage *PRO*-1 to boost SCI TV's operating profit after the buy - out.
Mr. Kravis apparently thinks 0 SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again, *PRO* allowing SCI TV to sell assets *PRO*-2 to pay debt.
Mr. Gillett is said *-1 to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations' ratings and turned around a Detroit station.
As for junk - holders, they're discovering 0 it *EXP*-2 can be a mistake *PRO* to take the other side of a trade by KKR.
The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted *-1 at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York, which *T*-2 trades distressed securities.
People who *T*-1 have seen SCI TV's restructuring plan say 0 it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp.
They would both give part of their combined $50 million *U* in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV's $488 million *U* of junk bonds, as a carrot 0 *T*-2 to persuade them *PRO*-3 to accept new bonds that *T*-1 might reduce the value of their claims on the company.
But some militant SCI TV junk - holders say 0 that's not enough.
They contend that SCI TV's equity now is worthless.
They add that it *EXP*-3 isn't costing KKR anything *PRO*-1 to give up equity because of its big up - front cash profit on the buy - out, which they think 0 *T*-2 contributed to SCI TV's current problems.
Kemper, the biggest holder of senior SCI TV bonds, has refused *PRO*-1 to join the bond - holders committee and is said *-1 to be reviewing its legal options.
*PRO*-1 To protect their claims, some junk - holders want KKR and perhaps Mr. Gillett to invest new money *ICH*-2 in SCI TV, perhaps $50 million or more *U*.
One investment banker who *T*-1 isn't involved in the deal says 0 SCI TV needs at least $50 million *U* of new equity *PRO*-2 to survive.
Junk - holders say 0 they have a stick 0 *PRO* to beat KKR with *T*-1: "The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool" 0 *PRO* to extract money from KKR *T*-2, says 0 *T*-3 one big SCI TV holder.
This could be the first major bankruptcy - law proceeding for KKR, he adds 0 *T*-1.
A big bankruptcy - court case might tarnish KKR's name, and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in Washington and elsewhere.
But others say 0 junk - holders have nothing 0 *PRO* to gain *T*-1 by *PRO* putting SCI TV into bankruptcy - law proceedings.
While KKR doesn't control SCI TV which *T*-1 is unusual for a KKR investment--it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. Gillett.
Bankruptcy specialists say 0 Mr. Kravis set a precedent for *PRO* putting new money in sour LBOs recently when KKR restructured foundering Seaman Furniture, *PRO*-1 doubling KKR's equity stake *T*-2.
But with Seaman, KKR was only trying *PRO*-1 to salvage its original investment, says 0 *T*-2 bankruptcy investor James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin in New York.
By contrast, KKR probably has already made all the money 0 it can *?* *T*-1 on SCI TV.
And people who *T*-1 know Mr. Kravis say 0 he isn't in a hurry *PRO* to pour more money into SCI TV.
The management turnover at Reebok International Ltd. continued with the resignation of company president C. Joseph LaBonte, who *T*-1 joined Reebok just two years ago.
Mr. LaBonte's departure follows by two months the resignation of Mark Goldston as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only 11 months at Reebok.
The resignations by the two executives, considered *PRO* hard - charging and abrasive by Reebok insiders, reflect a difference in style with Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, according to several former executives.
The two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited * by Reebok in the past few years *PRO*-1 to help it *PRO*-2 make the transition from a small start - up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $1.79 billion *U*.
The changes come as Reebok, which *T*-1 grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales flatten of late, is seeking *PRO*-2 to regain momentum in the athletic - shoe business against rivals Nike Inc. and L.A. Gear Inc.
The departures, said 0 *?* Alice Ruth, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, should enable the company *PRO*-2 to focus on business issues instead of management differences.
"I think 0 it's more an issue of style.
I would view it as a net positive.
The company can go about its business.
They're in the midst of a turnaround," she noted *T*-1.
Earnings have rebounded in 1989 after a 20% decline last year.
A former executive agreed that the departures don't reflect major problems, *PRO*-2 adding: "If you see any company that *T*-1 grows as fast as Reebok did *?*, it is going *-3 to have people coming and going."
Reebok said 0 Mr. LaBonte will resume the presidency of Vantage Group Inc., a California - based venture capital firm that he founded *T*-1 in 1983.
Before that he was president and chief operating officer of Twentieth Century - Fox Film Corp.
Reebok added that Mr. Fireman will assume the title of president.
A spokesman said that neither Mr. Fireman nor Mr. LaBonte would be available for comment.
"We will not be commenting beyond the news release," the spokesman said *T*-1.
Mr. Goldston, who *T*-1 had been president of Faberge Inc.'s Faberge U.S.A. division before *PRO*-2 joining Reebok in September 1988, left in August *PRO*-3 to pursue other interests.
In Poland's rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative, environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements *PRO* to restructure the economy, cut cumbersome bureaucracies, and democratize local politics.
Initial steps were taken *-1 at Poland's first international environmental conference, which I attended *T*-2 last month.
The conference, held * in Lower Silesia, was co-sponsored *-1 by the Environment Ministry, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Polish Ecological Club, and was attended *-1 by 50 Poles from government and industry, as well as Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, Japanese and Americans.
The conference was entitled *-1 *PRO*-4 "Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection," a significant departure from East Bloc usage, which *T*-2 recognizes only one economic mechanism--central planning--0 *T*-3 to direct industrial behavior.
Even more remarkably, it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches 0 *T*-1 to address pollution, notwithstanding Poland's lack of functioning markets.
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market - based pollution approaches *T*-1?
The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation.
Like other East Bloc countries, Poland possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance.
According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, 27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded *-1 as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.
Norms are consistently exceeded *-1 at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions.
Four - fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified; 70% of its southern forests are projected *-1 to die by century's end.
Between 1965 and 1985, Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33% to 6% of all surface waters, while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled.
Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe *?*.
Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50% higher than West Germany's, and 50% higher in hazard areas than the national average.
Since 1978, average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP.
Conference participants saw these effects as *PRO*-3 flowing directly from (a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which *T*-2 are not produced *-4 by labor; (b) planned economies' inability *PRO* to control pollution where enterprises are state - owned and penalties are paid *-1 by the government *T*-5; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West.
They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured *-1 without true ownership, genuine competition based on market factors, and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions.
The solutions 0 they formally proposed *T*-1 included lead / sulfur taxes, conservation and recycling incentives, reforestation offsets, transferable pollution permits, an ecological bank 0 *T*-2 to finance pollution - reduction credits, and debt - for - environment swaps.
But their most fundamental recommendation was *PRO* to separate industry from the state, *PRO* making it fully accountable for pollution control.
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos.
Indeed, skepticism was amply captured *-1 by a joke told * by Poles at the conference: "The world must be coming to an end.
The Russians are talking peace.
The Palestinians are talking elections.
And the Poles are engaged *-1 in commerce."
But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades 0 *T*-1 to reduce smelter pollution, or that the Soviets plan *PRO*-2 to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year.
Those implications include:--Privatization.
*PRO*-2 Faced *-1 with a $40 billion *U* foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation, Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies *PRO*-2 to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance.
Market - based pollution control may consume some capital that *T*-1 would otherwise purchase state industries.
But it could also accelerate "marketization" by *PRO*-1 reinforcing industrial accountability, breaking up state monopolies, giving managers a stake in solutions, and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure *PRO* to address environmental effects.
-- Least - cost solutions.
As conferees noted, scarce capital means 0 the costs of control must be minimized *-1 through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms.
That means simple, clear rules that *T*-1 secure the first large blocks of reduction, *PRO* deferring more complex issues such as risk.
It also means use of quantity - based pollution limits such as transferable permits, rather than price - based limits such as effluent fees.
That's because quota - trained managers will likely respond better *ICH*-1 to quantity than to price signals.
-- Creative financing.
Even least - cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars.
New types of financing must make funds available without *PRO* draining Poland's hard - currency reserves.
-- Democratization.
East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets.
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980, it *EXP*-1 was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information.
For once information flows, public participation follows and repression becomes difficult *PRO* to reimpose.
-- Global reciprocity.
One participant prematurely declared that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection, while Poland represents the opposite.
His point: It *EXP*-2 will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command - and - control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer.
At the moment, Poland resembles 19th - century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society--with antiquated production, inadequate environmental management, and little ecological awareness.
But the continuing pressures for free - market economics suggest 0 the conference's vision was not all fantasy.
Mr. Levin, former head of EPA's regulatory reform staff, adapted this from his November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association.
MCI Communications Corp. said 0 it received a $12 million *U* contract *PRO* to provide virtual network services to Woolworth Corp.'s 5,600 corporate and retail sites in the
The contract also provides for advanced billing and network management services.
Woolworth said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to expand usage of the MCI services as it adds about 6,000 business locations over the next few years.
The House Appropriations Committee approved an estimated $2.85 billion *U* in emergency funding 0 *PRO*-1 to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and to extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo.
The package was termed *-1 *PRO*-5 excessive by the Bush administration, but it also provoked a struggle with influential California lawmakers who *T*-2 sought unsuccessfully *PRO*-3 to add nearly $1 billion *U* more and waive current restrictions *PRO*-4 to expedite the distribution of funds.
By a 26 - 7 margin, the committee scuttled the more expensive alternative, and the debate forced a strained confrontation between Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss .) and his party's largest state delegation in the House.
"I have no regrets about *PRO* going forward," said *T*-2 Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.), who *T*-1 sought later *PRO*-3 to play down the sometimes hostile tone of the long evening meeting.
"We are the Golden State," Mr. Fazio said *?*, "and there is a certain amount of jealousy."
The $2.85 billion *U* package incorporates $500 million *U* for small - business loans, $1 billion *U* in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion *U* divided * between general emergency assistance and a reserve 0 *T*-1 to be available to President Bush *PRO*-2 to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
The funding is attached *-1 to a stopgap bill 0 *T*-2 to keep most of the government *PRO*-3 operating through Nov. 15.
The measure is expected *-1 to come before the House today, and Congress is under pressure *PRO* to complete action before midnight EDT tomorrow, when the current continuing resolution expires *T*-2.
Given California's size and political importance, the White House is eager *PRO*-1 to appear *-2 generous.
But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued that only $1.5 billion *U* in new federal appropriations are needed *-1 *PRO* to supplement existing resources.
A White House budget office analysis estimates that $500 million *U*--or half the level in the committee bill--is needed *-1 for highway assistance 0 *T*-2 to meet California's needs, and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed *-3 *PRO* to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration.
"Everybody appreciates that it is a national disaster and that we've got *-2 to address it," said *T*-3 Mr. Darman, who *T*-1 came to the Capitol *PRO*-4 to meet with Mr. Whitten and California lawmakers before the committee session.
"I would hope very much that we wouldn't end up in a kind of situation where you have a bidding war and then a veto threat *T*-1."
Although this White House pressure was clearly a factor among committee Republicans, no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.
*PRO*-1 A master of pork - barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion *U* package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship *PRO*-1 to keep the proposal *PRO*-2 intact and dismiss any alternative.
When Mr. Fazio offered the California - backed $3.84 billion *U* plan *T*-2, Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read *-1 aloud by the panel's clerk *PRO* to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought * by the delegation.
On the chairman's motion, the California package was subsequently reduced *-1 to less - binding report language, and even when this was accepted *-2 as such on a voice vote *T*-3, Mr. Whitten pointedly opposed it.
More important than money in many cases are *T*-2 waivers 0 California is seeking *T*-1 on current restrictions covering federal highway funds, such as a $100 million *U* cap on how much any single state can receive *T*-3 in emergency funds in a year.
Mr. Whitten's package appears *-1 to accomplish this purpose, but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on *PRO* having *-2 to put up any matching funds on repairs completed * in the next six months.
*PRO*-2 A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator, Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened *-3 not only by California's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments 0 he accepted *T*-1 in a vain effort *PRO* to build support in the panel.
The California Democrat appeared *-3 embarrassed by provisions inserted * on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands, and lumber interests sought *PRO*-1 to add another $100 million *U* in federal aid 0 *PRO* to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina *T*-2.
California's high - priced real estate puts it in an awkward position, too.
One provision last night would have raised the cap on disaster loans to $500,000 *U* from $100,000 *U* per household *PRO*-1 to accommodate San Francisco losses.
A group including Gene E. Phillips, former chairman of Southmark Corp., and William S. Friedman, former vice chairman of Southmark, lowered its stake in the Dallas real estate concern to 7.7%, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The group said 0 it sold 455,410 Southmark common shares from Sept. 5 to Oct. 5 for 18.75 cents to 25 cents a share.
The filing said 0 the group continues *-1 to hold 3,481,887 remaining shares.
William D. Forrester, president of the U.S. - U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, has a warning for U.S. companies trying *PRO* to do business in the Soviet Union.
"It's an extremely complex market, and you have *-2 to be prepared *PRO*-3 to make a big commitment," Mr. Forrester says *T*-1.
"We are not trying *PRO*-1 to encourage everyone."
*PRO*-1 Undeterred by such words of caution, corporate America is flocking to Moscow, *PRO*-1 lured *-2 by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt *PRO* to overhaul the Soviet economy.
*PRO* Doing business with the Russians, once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans, has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp., Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co., as well as a cluster of smaller firms.
*PRO* Reflecting the new - found interest, more than 140 U.S. companies are taking part in a Moscow exhibition organized * by Mr. Forrester's trade group.
But while U.S. interest may be big and growing, the difficulties that *T*-1 have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating.
Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy, Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked * to perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economy.
Executives say 0 Mr. Gorbachev's moves *PRO* to break up the government's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities.
Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who *T*-1 promise more than they can deliver *?*.
And some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage *PRO*-3 to overcome such hurdles *T*-2, their ventures now have *-4 to be endorsed *-1 by such unpredictable bodies as the Soviet parliament and the governments of the nation's republics.
"You have *-2 to go out to all your constituents," says *T*-3 James H. Giffen, who *T*-1 is spearheading the most ambitious attempt *ICH*-4 by U.S. firms *PRO* to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion *U* in some two dozen joint ventures.
As part of that attempt, by the American Trade Consortium, Mr. Giffen says 0 he spends a lot of time *PRO*-1 lobbying.
Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint - venture plans.
Over the past two years, Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms, including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S., Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups, about *PRO* jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants.
The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists, and officials say 0 many are likely *-1 to be scaled back *-2 or dropped *-2.
Whatever the difficulties *T*-2, Mr. Gorbachev remains committed to *PRO*-1 increasing foreign trade.
For political as well as economic reasons, U.S. companies are at the top of his priorities--a point 0 he underscored *T*-1 by *PRO*-2 spending two hours *PRO*-3 walking around the U.S. trade show last week.
*PRO*-2 Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards, Mr. Gorbachev appeared *-2 impatient for a big expansion in U.S. - Soviet trade, which *T*-1 now amounts to a meager $3 billion *U* annually.
The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that *T*-1 have concluded joint ventures, behind West Germany, Finland and Italy.
According to several people present at the meeting, Mr. Gorbachev also supported the idea of *PRO* concluding several commercial accords with the U.S., possibly at his next summit meeting with President Bush.
*PRO* Judging by the crush at the exhibition, deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products.
Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate - Palmolive Co. stand *PRO*-1 to receive a free tube of toothpaste, a commodity in chronically short supply here.
And unruly crowds at RJR Nabisco Inc.'s booth almost knocked over a glass showcase in the rush *PRO* to get a free Camel cigarette sticker.
Some U.S. products are filtering into the Soviet market under an emergency import program.
Both Colgate and Procter & Gamble have received big orders for toothpaste, soap and detergents.
The American Trade Consortium says 0 it is planning *PRO*-1 to ship some $500 million *U* of consumer goods, financed * by bank credits, in the first few months of next year.
But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one - time affair.
The goal of most U.S. firms--joint ventures--remains elusive.
Because the Soviet ruble isn't convertible into dollars, marks and other Western currencies, companies that *T*-1 hope *PRO*-2 to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods *PRO*-3 to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods 0 they can take *T*-4 in a counter-trade transaction.
International competition for the few Soviet goods that *T*-2 can be sold *-1 on world markets is heating up, however.
Shelley M. Zeiger, an entrepreneur from New Jersey who *T*-1 buys Soviet porcelain and "matryoshka" nesting dolls for export to the U.S., says 0 West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items.
*PRO*-3 Seeking *PRO*-2 to overcome the currency problems, Mr. Giffen's American Trade Consortium, which *T*-1 comprises Chevron Corp., RJR, Johnson & Johnson, Eastman Kodak Co., and Archer - Daniels - Midland Co., has concocted an elaborate scheme 0 *PRO* to share out dollar earnings, largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project *T*-4.
Several medical concerns, including Pfizer Inc., Hewlett - Packard Co., Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend *PRO*-1 to pursue a similar consortium approach.
"It *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to invest capital here on the same basis as *PRO* investing in other countries," says *T*-3 Dennis A. Sokol, president of Medical Service Partners Inc., who *T*-1 is putting the medical consortium together.
Some U.S. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale.
One group seeks *PRO*-1 to publish a U.S. - Soviet medical journal in conjunction with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health.
According to Richard P. Mills, a Boston - based official of the U.S. partner, 10,000 copies of the quarterly will be printed *-1 in Russian from next year.
It will be financed *-1 by advertisements from U.S. companies and by simultaneous publication of an English - language journal containing details of Soviet medical advancements.
"We found a market niche," Mr. Mills boasts *T*-1.
"It's truly entrepreneurial.
At Lloyd's of London, underwriters still scratch out policies *PRO*-1 using fountain pens and blotting paper.
Visitors are ushered *-1 into the premises by red - frocked doormen known * as waiters, a reminder of the insurance market's origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London.
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present.
Lloyd's, once a pillar of the world insurance market, is being shaken *-1 to its very foundation.
The 301 - year - old exchange is battered *-1 by enormous claims from a decade - long run of unprecedented disasters, the most recent of which *T*-2 is last week's earthquake in California's Bay Area.
At the same time, Lloyd's is besieged *-1 by disgruntled investors and hamstrung *-1 by inefficient but time - honored ways of *PRO* conducting business.
The exchange is gradually being squeezed *-1 into narrow, less - profitable segments of the market by less hidebound competitors.
"Lloyd's is on the ropes," says *T*-2 Peter Nutting, a Lloyd's investor for 17 years who *T*-1 now leads a dissident group threatening *PRO* to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence.
"It needs more discipline.
It needs *-1 to sort itself out."
Most troublesome is *T*-1 the shrinking pool of "names," the well - heeled investors (some of them royal) who *T*-2, as members of about 360 syndicates, underwrite policies.
Some 1,750 members quit the exchange last year, more than triple the number of resignations in 1987.
Names are resigning at an even faster pace this year.
Lackluster returns are one reason.
The average after - tax return on investment in 1986, the most recent year for which results are available *T*-1, was 6.5%, according to Chatset Ltd., an insurance consulting firm in London.
In 1985, it was 2.1%.
Between 1981 and 1986, the most recent five - year period for which figures are available *T*-1, Lloyd's reported over #3.6 billion *U* in claims and reserves against future losses ($5.7 billion *U* at today's exchange rates), more than double the #1.35 billion *U* posted * in the previous five - year period.
Many of the 31,329 investors who *T*-1 remain are beginning *-2 to question one of the exchange's most basic tenets, the concept of unlimited personal liability.
Investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims *T*-1, but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe.
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly.
Lloyd's claims for the 1988 Piper Alpha oil - rig disaster in the North Sea, for instance, may reach $1 billion *U*.
During the five - year period ended * 1986, roughly 80% of the names had money tied up in money - losing syndicates, according to Chatset consultants.
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of them now.
"I have wished 0 I could die and be out of it--that's how bad it is *T*-2," Betty Atkins, a secretary from suburban London, says *T*-1.
Ms. Atkins, whose Lloyd's membership *T*-2 was a bonus from a former employer in 1981, belongs to Mr. Nutting's dissident group on the Outhwaite syndicate, which *T*-3 has been hard hit *-1 by asbestos reinsurance claims.
Ms. Atkins, who *T*-1 underwrote #20,000 *U*, or about $32,000 *U*, of insurance coverage on that syndicate, now faces potential losses of roughly #70,000 *U*, or $111,000 *U*.
"If Lloyd's wants #70,000 *U* out of me they will have *-3 to take everything 0 I've got *T*-2--and even then I don't know if it will be enough," she says *T*-1.
Unease is widespread among exchange members.
"I can't think of any reason 0 *PRO* to join Lloyd's now *T*-2," says *T*-1 Keith Whitten, a British businessman and a Lloyd's member since 1979.
"The downside is very considerable, and at the moment the upside is very marginal."
If profits don't improve, Mr. Whitten says 0 he may quit the exchange *T*-1.
Meanwhile, competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying.
Lloyd's is being squeezed *-1 out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance.
Over the past decade, competitors have chipped away at the exchange's share of the #2.5 billion *U* marine market in London, where half the world's ships are insured *-1 *T*-2.
Lloyd's 66% stake in that market has shrunk to 50% in that period, according to an official at the Institute of London Underwriters, a Lloyd's competitor.
(The official asked *PRO*-1 not to be named *-2.)
Much of the business has gone to the institute, an association of more than 100 insurers, including Cigna Corp., Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany and Britain's Commercial Union Assurance PLC.
Lloyd's has endured decades of genteel decline.
At the peak of its power and influence a century ago, Lloyd's dominated the insurance world with a 50% stake.
It virtually dictated how ships were *-2 to be built *-1 *T*-3 and it monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe.
Today, Lloyd's share of the world market, excluding life insurance, is about 2%.
(Its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included *-1.)
Bigger rivals, such as Aetna and Allianz, *PRO*-1 backed * by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches, operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates, brokers say 0 *T*-2.
Though Lloyd's pioneered such now - standard policies as worker's compensation insurance, burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses, and bankers' liability insurance, competitors now underwrite most of that business.
Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by *PRO*-1 insuring themselves through "captive" offshore companies for industry - specific coverage.
Even Lloyd's specialty--unusually risky ventures--is being challenged *-1.
Only 10 years ago, for instance, Lloyd's was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses.
But since 1981, Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington, Ky. has grabbed a 20% stake of the market.
Ronald Kirk, president, says 0 Lloyd's has suffered because its structure doesn't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients; brokers are required intermediaries.
Thus, he asserts 0 *?*, Lloyd's can't react quickly to competition.
"Lloyd's has lost control of the situation," he says *T*-1.
"They aren't controlling their destiny like they used *-1 to *?*."
Murray Lawrence, Lloyd's chairman, agrees 0 the exchange faces big challenges.
"This is a watershed time, and we are trying *PRO*-1 to plot our way ahead," he says *T*-2.
"We have been a great market for *PRO* inventing risks which other people then take *T*-1, copy *T*-1 and cut rates."
Lloyd's, he says 0 *?*, is cut off from "the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which *T*-1 acts as a steadying influence" against catastrophic losses.
By that, he means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance.
The exchange, he says 0 *?*, must find new products and new markets.
That won't be an easy task.
Tradition is dictator at Lloyd's.
Three years ago, the exchange took up residence in a space - age tower of steel and glass--evocative of the kind of modern architecture that Britain's Prince Charles has denounced *T*-1.
(Some exchange wags call the building *PRO*-1 "the oil rig.")
But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson's spyglass, Lloyd's also brought its outmoded ways of *PRO* doing business.
The Lloyd's market actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day, brokers say 0 *T*-1.
Underwriting doesn't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m.
A two - hour lunch break follows.
Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m., just in time for afternoon tea.
Lloyd's vast trading hall houses a warren of well - polished desks.
The hall's few computers are used *-1 mostly *PRO* to send messages.
*PRO*-1 Sandwiched between desks, underwriters sit on benches surrounded * by stacks of policies.
Brokers clutching thick folders stand in lines, *PRO*-1 waiting their turn 0 *PRO* to speak to the underwriters *T*-2.
A broker may have *-2 to approach as many as 20 underwriters who *T*-1 insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates.
It *EXP*-2 could take six months for a claim to be paid *-1.
"The system," says *?* Nicholas Samengo - Turner, a Lloyd's broker who *T*-1 left the exchange in 1985, "is so ludicrously unprofessional 0 it drives you mad."
Some maintain 0 underwriters also have been inept.
John Wetherell, a Lloyd's underwriter, says 0 he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as 50% the premiums 0 they should have charged *T*-1 for property risks from 1980 to 1985.
"How unprofessional we must have appeared *-3 *T*-1 to the outside world--how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation," he says *T*-2.
Lloyd's officials decline *PRO*-1 to comment on the matter.
More recently, property rates have increased.
Many at Lloyd's expect 0 the San Francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further.
But it will be years before it *EXP*-1 is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters.
The magnitude of the exchange's problems may not become known for some time because of Lloyd's practice of *PRO* leaving the books *PRO*-2 open for three years *PRO*-1 to allow for the settlement of claims.
Lloyd's only recently reported its financial results for 1986.
That year, it posted record pretax profit of #650 million *U*, a gain 0 it attributes *T*-1 to higher rates and fewer claims.
But Mr. Lawrence says 0 reported profit will be down in 1987, 1988 and 1989, though he declines *PRO*-1 to specify how steep the decline will be *T*-2.
Insurance analysts say 0 the exchange's downturn in profitability is likely *-2 to be aggravated *-1 by more than $600 million *U* in aviation losses (including the 1988 Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland) and a still - uncalculated chunk of claims from September's Hurricane Hugo.
Lloyd's says 0 the departures of names isn't likely *-1 to hurt its underwriting capacity, currently about #11 billion *U*.
Mr. Lawrence says 0 the drain of funds has been offset *-1 by an increase in investments by the remaining names.
Meanwhile, the exchange has been trying *PRO*-1 to lower costs.
(It recently cut its work force by 9%, or 213.)
But Lloyd's is hampered *-1 in its efforts *PRO* to overhaul operations by its reluctance *PRO* to embrace modern technology.
Mr. Wetherell, the underwriter, reckons 0 half of his business could be transacted *-1 by computer, *PRO* cutting costs at least 10%.
Though Lloyd's has talked for years about *PRO*-1 computerizing underwriting transactions, the effort hasn't gotten very far.
Competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath *PRO*-1 to centralize price and policy information.
Both groups cling to traditional face - to - face dealings, even for routine policies.
Lloyd's overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts *PRO* to update marketing strategies.
Some underwriters have been pressing for years *PRO*-1 to tap the low - margin business by *PRO*-2 selling some policies directly to consumers.
Lloyd's presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public, and such policies are sold *-1 only in limited markets such as the U.K. and Canada.
But such changes must be cleared *-2 by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters, brokers and administrators before *PRO* being implemented *-1.
The proposal *PRO* to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand.
Lloyd's is moving forward on some fronts, though.
Mr. Lawrence says 0 the exchange is updating some procedures *PRO*-1 to make speedier payments on claims.
By next year, all underwriters will be linked *-1 to a communications network that *T*-2 could reduce paper work on claims.
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said 0 it formed a unit 0 *T*-1 to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and, eventually, to U.S. theaters, too.
The operator of cable - television networks said 0 the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that *T*-1 will premiere on Turner Broadcasting's Turner Network Television channel, or TNT, and then will be released *-2 internationally in movie theaters.
The unit's first two offerings are slated *-3 *PRO*-4 to be "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a dramatization about the former British spy who *T*-1 wrote the James Bond novels, and "Treasure Island," produced * by Charlton Heston, who *T*-2 also stars in the movie.
Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting's chairman, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 chairman of Turner Pictures, and Gerry Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, was named *-2 *PRO*-4 president of the unit.
In an interview, Mr. Hogan said 0 the subsidiary's primary mission will be *PRO* to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally.
But he said 0 Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that *T*-1 might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S. .
"When that occurs *T*-1, and when the time is right *T*-2, we'll release the films in the U.S.," he said *T*-3, *PRO*-4 adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991.
Turner has made several movies, docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years, but the company has never acted as a full - fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters.
Mr. Hogan said 0 "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming" and "Treasure Island" cost more than $6 million *U* each *ICH*-1 *PRO* to make *?*, which *T*-3 is only about one - third the cost of most movies made * for theatrical release.
The Turner move is in line with a cable - TV trend toward more original programming--and toward *PRO* finding more ways 0 *PRO* to amortize the high cost of *PRO* producing films *T*-1.
In July, Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures 0 *T*-2 to produce 12 low - budget movies a year that *T*-1 will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed *-3 later in various markets, including foreign theaters.
It was the kind of snubbing rarely seen within the Congress, let alone within the same party.
Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez.
It was offered *-1 as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez, who *T*-2 is investigating the $2.5 billion *U* failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.
But instead of thanks, Sen. Cranston was treated *-1 with cool formality.
"Every witness receives a formal subpoena," Rep. Gonzalez told him *T*-1.
Seldom have House hearings caused so much apprehension in the Senate, where California Sen. Cranston and four other senators were already writhing in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged looting of Lincoln by their friend and political benefactor, Charles Keating Jr., principal stockholder of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz *T*-1.
At the first day of the House Banking Committee's hearings last week, William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created * *PRO* to sell sick thrifts, said 0 the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions.
Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million *U* in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.
Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who *T*-1 has accused the five senators of *PRO*-2 attempting *PRO*-3 to "subvert" the regulatory process by *PRO*-4 intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating.
Unlike many lawmakers, Chairman Gonzalez says 0 he considers *PRO* intervening with regulators to be improper.
"When you reach a point where a policy - making body is trying *PRO*-4 to shape administrative decisions *T*-3 *T*-2, then that's a no - no in my book," the Texas lawmaker says *T*-1.
And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously.
"Unless the questions are answered *-1, I will keep on *-2 going."
Lawmakers often are reluctant *PRO*-1 to embarrass colleagues, even those of opposing political parties.
In the recent Housing and Urban Development Department scandal, for example, Rep. Thomas Lantos, the California Democrat who *T*-1 led the hearings, tiptoed through embarrassing disclosures about HUD grants secured * by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican.
But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick.
He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman, a bank - baiting Texas populist who *T*-1 chaired the Banking Committee until 1974.
Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who *T*-1 refuses *PRO*-3 to accept honorariums and who *T*-2 believes in *PRO* conducting official business in the open.
Early in his political career, as a city councilman in San Antonio, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced *-1 *T*-2, *PRO*-3 denouncing the closed - door affair publicly as a "bat - roost meeting."
The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed *PRO*-1 seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly.
Rep. Gonzalez seems primed *PRO*-1 to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco, William Black and Mike Patriarca *T*-2.
Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for *PRO* supervising Lincoln in 1988.
Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned *-1 to Washington by Mr. Wall last week *PRO*-2 to discuss their testimony in advance.
"I think 0 he is trying *PRO*-2 to improperly influence a witness, and by God I'm not going *-3 to tolerate it," he says *T*-1.
Mr. Wall, however, is a self - proclaimed "child of the Senate" and former staff director of its Banking Committee.
An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others, Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John McCain (R., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich .).
They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years *T*-1.
"I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out," Mr. Gonzalez says *T*-1.
This is raising eyebrows.
"When I first got a glimpse at the witness list *T*-2, I couldn't believe that they were going *-3 to go ahead and do this," says *T*-1 Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a consumer group.
"There are some witnesses who *T*-1 will be forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to testify about their meetings with senators."
And a Democratic aide to a Banking Committee member remarks, "I too am astounded by it, because Gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of Democratic senators in a very bad position."
All the senators say 0 they merely were trying *PRO*-1 to ensure fairness for a constituent.
Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix, and the California thrift's parent is an Ohio - chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan.
Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle, his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
"He's wise, he's good and I know 0 he's an honest man," the Texan says *T*-1.
But at the same time, Mr. Gonzalez hasn't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House - Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer.
The Senate negotiators included Sens. Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall's principal sponsor, Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah.
They were willing *PRO*-2 to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation *PRO*-3 to preserve Mr. Wall's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon *-1 *PRO*-5 to testify about Lincoln S&L *T*-4.
Most importantly, the Senate traded away the Bush administration's controversial plan *PRO* to finance the bailout, which *T*-2 was partly reinstated *-1 later.
At the time, Mr. Gonzalez said 0 several senators told him that they "could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall."
Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation.
"In a way, that's what this is *T*-1," Mr. Gonzalez concedes *T*-2.
Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout.
Mr. Keating raised $20,000 *U* for Rep. Doug Barnard's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who *T*-1 wanted *PRO*-2 to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering.
He recently voted "present" when the committee authorized a subpoena 0 *T*-2 to compel Mr. Keating *PRO*-3 to testify *T*-1, then changed his vote to yes.
But the chairman's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $1.1 billion *U* fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others.
Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa) says 0 the Lincoln S&L affair is "the biggest bank heist in history," and adds: "The great question that *T*-2 remains *-3 to be resolved *-1 is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making."
A witness set *PRO* to testify on Thursday was quoted *-1 in a news report over the weekend as *PRO*-3 saying 0 Lincoln "laundered" campaign contributions illegally.
But the witness, William Crawford, California's chief state thrift regulator, denies *PRO*-1 saying that.
"I don't know whether it was done *-1 properly or not, because I'm not a lawyer," he said *T*-2 in a telephone interview yesterday.
But he said 0 he is prepared *PRO*-1 to testify that executives of Lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls directing them *PRO*-2 to make specific contributions.
The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall's predecessor, Edwin Gray.
He has characterized the five senators' roles as "tantamount to an attempt *PRO* to subvert the...regulatory process," and he isn't expected *-1 to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting.
So the senators must brace themselves.
Sen. Cranston, as he returned to the capital last week from a one - day trip 0 *PRO* to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco *T*-1, sighed to an aide: "Well, back to Keatingland.
Randolph W. McElroy, a vice chairman of this bank - holding company, was named *-1 to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit, Sovran Bank.
Mr. McElroy, 54 years old, will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit.
Sovran also named John B. Werner *PRO*-1 a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of Sovran Financial, *PRO* increasing the number of corporate board members to 35.
Mr. Werner, 58, was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit.
Cray Research Inc. said 0 it sold one of its newest and largest computer systems, the Cray Y - MP / 832, to the United Kingdom Meteorological Office.
The system is the first 0 *T*-2 to be sold *-1 through the joint marketing agreement between Cray and Control Data Corp.
The supercomputer, which *T*-2 lists for $18.5 million *U*, will be installed *-1 in the first quarter of 1990 in the meteorological office's headquarters in Bracknell, England.
Manville, *PRO*-1 having rid itself of asbestos, now sells fiberglass, forest products, minerals and industrial goods.
Heady stuff it's not *T*-1.
But Manville's ownership is unusual, and it has caught the eye of some canny--and patient--investors.
The Denver - based concern, which *T*-2 emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings late last year, is controlled *-1 by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.
The trust, which *T*-1 owns 80% of Manville's stock on a fully diluted basis, is a separate legal entity that *T*-2 is settling claims with asbestos victims.
When and if the trust runs out of cash *T*-2--which *T*-1 seems *-4 increasingly likely--it will need *-3 to convert its Manville stock to cash.
But as an 80% owner, if it tried *PRO*-1 to sell much of its stock in the market, it would likely depress the price of its shares.
Some investors say 0 there is a good chance that the trust will, instead, seek *PRO*-2 to convert the company's shares to cash, in some sort of friendly restructuring that *T*-1 wouldn't involve *PRO* just dumping stock on the market.
"Their principal asset is Manville common stock," says *T*-3 Jeffrey Halis, who *T*-1 runs Sabre Associates, an investment fund that *T*-2 owns Manville shares.
"If they tried *PRO*-1 to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail.
What *T*-1 makes the most sense is *PRO* to find someone who *T*-2 wants *PRO*-3 to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares."
The trust isn't commenting on when it might need *-2 to liquefy its Manville stock *T*-1.
However, the trust's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims.
Its cash and liquid securities fell by $338 million *U* in the first six months of 1989.
The trust also will receive $75 million *U* a year starting in 1991 on a bond 0 it holds *T*-1 from Manville.
And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of Manville's annual net income.
Even so, the trust would seem *-1 to be facing a cash crunch.
As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 *U* each.
(The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled *-1 first).
And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million *U*--more than half the trust's total of $268 million *U* in cash and marketable securities.
"At some point, we're going *-2 to need an infusion of funds," a person close to the trust says *T*-1.
Even before then, the trust may be eager *PRO*-1 to unload Manville stock.
It doesn't pay a dividend, and this trust needs income.
Moreover, with 88% of its assets tied *-1 up in Manville, the trust is badly in need of diversification.
"Obviously, a diversified portfolio would have less risk," the person close to the trust says *T*-1.
Manville itself doesn't rule out a restructuring.
Though the ink *ICH*-2 is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, Bill Bullock, Manville's head of investor relations, says 0 the company is continually pondering "whether there is a better way 0 *PRO* to be structured *-1 *T*-3.
We understand that the trust is ultimately going *-1 to need *-2 to sell some of our shares," he says *T*-3.
Of course, one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust's shares--which *T*-1 would do little *PRO* to benefit public stockholders.
But the trust, in most cases, is forbidden *-1 from *PRO*-2 seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993.
And both the trust and Manville are seeking *PRO*-1 to avoid the bad publicity that *T*-2, in the asbestos era, tarred the Manville name.
Thus, analysts say 0 *?*, the trust is unlikely *-3 to do anything that *T*-1 would hurt Manville's other shareholders.
"This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which *T*-1 will probably act in the interests of the minority holders," one investor says *T*-2.
Even if there is no restructuring, Manville seems *-1 to be attractive long - term.
Its stock, at 9 5/8, trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings--an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession - sensitive customers.
Mr. Bullock says 0 45% of revenues are tied *-1 to construction.
Analysts predict little or no near - term growth.
They are, nonetheless, high on Manville's management.
"It's one of the best in the business," says *T*-1 Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi.
And he says 0 Manville has the financial flexibility 0 *PRO* to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction - related firms are hurting and selling cheap *T*-2 *T*-1.
With a conservative debt - to - equity ratio of 1 - to - 1--and $329 million *U* in cash--Manville is indeed actively on the prowl.
So far, as a price - conscious shopper, Manville hasn't bought much.
Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, says, "Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined *-1 about acquisitions."
And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80% of its stock in friendly hands, Manville is the rare publicly traded company that *T*-1 can ignore short - term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul.

Maidenform Inc. loves *PRO*-1 to be intimate with its customers, but not with the rest of the public.
The 67 - year - old maker of brassieres, panties, and lingerie enjoys one of the best - known brand images, but its financial profile is closely guarded *-1 by members of the founding family.
"There are very few companies that *T*-1 can boast of such a close - knit group," says *T*-3 Robert A. Brawer, 52 years old, recently named * *PRO*-4 president, *PRO* succeeding Beatrice Coleman, his mother - in - law, who *T*-2 remains chairman.
"We are a vanishing breed," he muses *T*-1.
Mrs. Coleman, 73, who *T*-2 declined *PRO*-3 to be interviewed *-1, is the Maidenform strategist.
Sales have tripled during her 21 - year tenure to about $200 million *U* in 1988.
Maidenform says 0 it is very profitable but declines *PRO*-1 to provide specifics.
The company sells image.
Its current ad campaign, on which Maidenform has spent more than $15 million *U* *T*-1 since fall 1987, doesn't even show its underwear products, but rather men like Christopher Reeve, star of the "Superman" movies, talking about their lingerie turn - ons.
The Maidenform name "is part of American pop culture," says 0 *T*-1 Joan Sinopoli, account supervisor of the campaign by Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a New York ad firm.
Maidenform generated such memorable campaigns as "I dreamed 0 I...in my Maidenform bra," and "The Maidenform woman.
You never know where she'll turn up *T*-1."
"*PRO* Capitalizing on the brand is key," says *T*-2 Mr. Brawer, whose immediate plans *T*-1 include further international expansion and *PRO* getting better control of distribution outside the U.S. .
"The intimate apparel industry is perceived *-3 to be a growth industry and clearly {Maidenform} is a force 0 *PRO* to be reckoned *-1 with *T*-4," says *T*-2 David S. Leibowitz, a special situations analyst at American Securities Corp. in New York.
Although working women are "forced *-1 *PRO*-4 to wear the uniform of the day, *PRO*-2 to retain their femininity they are buying better quality, more upscale intimate apparel," he said *T*-3.
Although Mr. Brawer's appointment as president was long expected *-1, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising.
Three days later, Mr. Lesk was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief executive officer of Olga Co., a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc.
Warnaco also owns Warners, another major intimate apparel maker.
Mr. Lesk couldn't be reached *-1 *PRO*-1 to comment.
But Maidenform officials say that after *PRO*-1 spending 24 years at Maidenform, Mr. Lesk, 48, made it *EXP*-2 clear 0 he wanted the top job.
"If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm 0 *PRO* to work for *T*-4," says *T*-3 James Mogan, 45, who *T*-2 was named *-1 *PRO*-5 senior vice president of sales, *PRO*-1 assuming some of the responsibilities of Mr. Lesk.
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people.
"My style is less informal," Mr. Brawer says *T*-1.
Top officers insist 0 Maidenform's greatest strength is its family ownership.
"You can't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart," one delights *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-2 is fun *PRO* competing as a private company," Mr. Brawer says *T*-1.
"You can think long range."
Other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way.
Warnaco was taken *-1 *PRO*-2 private by Spectrum Group in 1986 for about $487 million *U*.
And last year, Playtex Holdings Inc. went private for about $680 million *U*.
It was then split into Playtex Apparel Inc., the intimate apparel division, and Playtex Family Products Corp., which *T*-1 makes tampons, hair - care items and other products.
Publicly traded VF Corp., which *T*-1 owns Vanity Fair, and Sara Lee Corp., which *T*-2 owns Bali Co., are also strong forces in intimate apparel.
Buy - out offers for Maidenform aren't infrequent, says 0 *?* Executive Vice President David C. Masket, but they aren't taken very seriously.
When he gets calls *T*-1, "I don't even have *-2 to consult" with Mrs. Coleman, Mr. Masket says 0 *T*-3.
The company could command a good price in the market.
"Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom *T*-3 have strong brand names, have been bought *-1 at about 60% of sales," says *T*-2 Deborah Bronston, Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. apparel analyst.
Mr. Brawer, along with Mrs. Coleman and her daughter, Elizabeth, an attorney who *T*-1 is vice chairman, are the family members involved in the operations of Maidenform, which *T*-2 employs about 5,000.
Mr. Brawer's wife, Catherine, and Robert Stroup, Elizabeth's husband, round out the five - member board.
Each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings.
"We are all very amiable," Mr. Brawer says *T*-1.
Executives say 0 Mrs. Coleman is very involved in the day - to - day operations, especially product development.
In the late 1960s she designed a lightweight stretch bra that *T*-1 boosted sales.
Her father, William Rosenthal, designed the then - dress making company's first bra *ICH*-1 in the 1920s, which he said 0 *T*-2 gave women a "maiden form" compared * with the "boyish form" 0 they got *T*-3 from the "flat bandages" used * for support at the time.
While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs, his wife, Ida, concentrated on sales and other financial matters.
The name Maidenform was coined *-1 by a third business partner, Enid Bissett.
The company has 14 plants and distribution facilities in the U.S., Puerto Rico, other parts of the Caribbean and Ireland.
Maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores, but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in Omaha, Neb., and has 24 factory outlets, with plans *PRO* to add more.
Before *PRO*-2 joining Maidenform in 1972, Mr. Brawer, who *T*-1 holds a doctoral degree in English from the University of Chicago, taught at the University of Wisconsin.
As a senior vice president, he has headed the company's designer lingerie division, Oscar de la Renta, since its inception in 1988.
*PRO*-1 To maintain exclusivity of that designer line, it isn't labeled with the Maidenform name.
While the company has always been family - run, Mr. Brawer isn't the first person 0 *T*-1 to marry into the family and subsequently head Maidenform.
Mrs. Coleman's husband, Joseph, a physician, succeeded Mrs. Rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in 1968.
Rockwell International Corp. bought out Ikegai Corp.'s interest in Ikegai - Goss, a joint venture of the two companies based * in Tokyo.
The price was 3.6 billion yen ($25 million *U*).
The agreement provides that Ikegai Corp. will remain a supplier to Ikegai - Goss, which *T*-1 makes printing presses for the newspaper industry.
The purchase was made *-1 by Rockwell Graphic Systems, a Chicago subsidiary of the El Segundo, Calif., concern.
Ikegai - Goss, which *T*-1 has about 200 employees, is among the industry leaders in keyless inking technology, which *T*-2 reduces time and materials waste when *PRO* preparing a press for printing *T*-3.
SHEVARDNADZE ADMITTED that Moscow violated the 1972 ABM treaty.
In a foreign - policy address before the Soviet legislature, the foreign minister conceded that the radar station in Krasnoyarsk breached the superpower Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and said 0 it would be dismantled *-1.
Shevardnadze said 0 it *EXP*-1 took Gorbachev's government four years *PRO*-2 to determine that the station's location in Siberia violated the accord, as Western arms - control officials have long contended.
He also denounced Moscow's nine - year involvement in the war in Afghanistan, *PRO*-1 saying 0 it involved "gross violations of...civil norms and ethics."
Secretary of State Baker, in his first major arms - control speech, called for a new military relationship with Moscow *PRO* to reduce "first strike" nuclear arms.

Chip's Memory Is Here Today, Here Tomorrow
TWO COMPANIES plan *PRO*-2 to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that *T*-1 store data even when the power is off *T*-3.
Today's most widely used data - storing chips have "volatile" memories--their data disappear if they aren't fed a steady diet of electricity, so they need external power supplies.
National Semiconductor Corp. and a start - up named * *PRO*-4 Ramtron Corp. plan *PRO*-2 to start *-3 shipping so - called ferroelectric memories, which *T*-1 can remember data for at least 10 years without any current flowing to them.
The chips use materials, such as lead zirconate titanate, *PRO*-2 to form microscopic switches that *T*-1 retain their data without electricity.
Developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology isn't fully refined *-1.
But Ramtron of Colorado Springs, Colo., plans *PRO*-1 to start *-2 shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December.
The company expects the chips eventually to be used *-2 in devices that *T*-1 mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment, including floppy - disk and hard - disk drives.
National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque, N.M.
National says 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Krysalis's assets and will start *-1 shipping commercial quantities of its first chips, including a 4 - kilobit memory, next year.
Once production hurdles are overcome *-1, the chips could take over a significant part of the market.
In addition to *PRO*-1 not needing an outside power source, they are potentially cheaper *PRO* to make *-1 because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips.
Military buyers have shown interest, National says 0 *?*, because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation.
And while today's non-volatile chips--such as electronically erasable programmable *PRO* read - only memory chips--can't be used *-1 in a computer's central memory because they "learn" data slowly, ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds.
*PRO* Showing Up in Court Without *PRO* Being There
AN AUSTIN, Texas, company plans *PRO*-1 to make it *EXP*-2 easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without *PRO*-3 leaving town.
Witnesses often must travel long distances *PRO*-1 to give face - to - face depositions before lawyers and court reporters.
That means huge travel bills.
And telephone or videotape depositions just don't match physical encounters.
That could change, thanks to lower long - distance rates and cheaper electronics.
Video Telecom Corp., which *T*-1 markets videoconferencing systems, is working with court reporters *PRO*-2 to wire a nationwide network 0 *T*-3 to allow depositions by live television.
The company installed a prototype system that *T*-1 connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines.
And it is preparing *PRO*-1 to set up shop in Chicago, New York and 10 other cities where court - reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network *T*-2.
While lawyers arranged individual tie - ups before, the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper.
An attorney will be able *PRO*-1 to use the network for an hourly fee of between $200 and $400 *U*, depending on the quality of the picture, *PRO*-2 to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities.
Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection
JAPAN'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers.
Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables.
Until now, most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them.
But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan's electronics industry when it accused Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. of *PRO*-1 using Hitachi technology *PRO*-3 to make dynamic random - access memory chips *T*-2.
(A settlement was reached *-1 but wasn't made *-1 public.)
And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S.'s Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that Motorola's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent.
Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of *PRO*-1 reverse engineering a Hitachi technology--a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers.
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say 0 Japan is starting *-2 to take *T*-1.
Hitachi made the reverse - engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim filed * in a federal district court in Texas after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation.
Hitachi charges 0 Motorola "has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents" used * in Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor chip.
Translation: Motorola appears *-3 to have taken a Hitachi technology that *T*-2 is patented *-1 in the U.S., Hitachi says 0 *?*, and "tried *PRO*-5 to make it look like a new technology."
Motorola either denied *RNR*-1 or wouldn't comment on *RNR*-1 the various charges.
Odds and Ends
COMPUTER chips that *T*-2 simulate human vision have been developed *-1 by Japan's Sharp Corp.
They mimic the brain by *PRO*-1 "looking" at an image, extracting the fundamentals--boundaries, corners and lines--and translating them into computer data.
Sharp says 0 the set of chips could improve fax machines, graphics computers or identification systems that *T*-1 recognize facial features....
An N.V . Philips unit has created a computer system that *T*-1 processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems.
*PRO*-2 Using reduced instruction - set computing, or RISC, chips made * by Intergraph of Huntsville, Ala., the system splits the image 0 it "sees" *T*-1 into 20 digital representations, each processed * by one chip.
The Senate convicted U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida of eight impeachment articles, *PRO*-1 removing the 53 - year - old judge from his $89,500 *U* - a - year, lifetime job.
Mr. Hastings's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time 0 a federal official was impeached *-2 and removed *-2 from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him *T*-3 *T*-1.
In 1983, Mr. Hastings was found *-1 not guilty of *PRO* accepting a $150,000 *U* bribe in a case before him, the central charge on which the Senate convicted him *T*-2.
He was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial.
With no floor debate, the Senate on Friday voted 69 - 26 *PRO*-1 to convict Mr. Hastings of perjury and *PRO* conspiring *PRO*-2 to accept a bribe, five votes more than needed.
Conviction on any single impeachment article was enough *PRO*-1 to remove Judge Hastings from office.
He was found *-1 not guilty of three charges, involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive, government investigation.
The Senate didn't vote on six lesser charges.
Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted *-1 by a jury, lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment isn't *PRO* to punish an individual.
Instead, they argued that impeachment aims *PRO*-2 to protect public institutions from people who *T*-1 have abused their positions of trust, irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases.
Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll - call votes, then quickly left the chamber.
In an impromptu news conference on the Capitol steps, he denounced the senators' action.
"Their opinion is devoid of the wisdom of the forefathers' teaching regarding impeachment," Mr. Hastings said *T*-1.
For the future, he said 0 he would run for governor of Florida.
Mr. Hastings was appointed *-1 to the federal bench by President Carter in 1979 and was one of the few black federal judges in the country.
While he packed the Senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial, most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case.
Following the impeachment conviction, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, issued a restrained statement, *PRO*-1 warning that the Hastings case could set a "dangerous precedent," but adding, "We must respect the considered judgment of the Senate.
Harsco Corp. said 0 it obtained a $33.1 million *U* export order for armored recovery vehicles and related support equipment.
Harsco declined *PRO*-2 to say what country *T*-1 placed the order.
The company said 0 it received an order for 23 of the vehicles, which *T*-1 retrieve tanks and other heavy - tracked vehicles when they break down or are damaged *-2 *T*-3, and an option for 16 more.
Delivery is *-1 to begin in early 1991.
Harsco produces products for defense, industrial, commercial and construction markets.
We've heard California's property - tax - cutting Proposition 13 blamed *-2 for a lot over the years, but ABC's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed * for road maintenance *T*-1.
Mr. Katz happily agreed, *PRO*-1 sliding over the fact that California's roads and bridges aren't funded *-2 by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes.
Both have been raised *-1 at least 30% in recent years, even while the price of gasoline has fallen.
*PRO* Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long stretch.
Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said 0 OPEC oil producers aren't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter.
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $19.76 *U* for December delivery.
Petroleum products prices also declined.
Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day, with some accounts putting the 13 - nation group's output *PRO*-1 as high as 23 million barrels a day.
That level of production didn't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter, when demand is traditionally strong *T*-1.
But because first - quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year, several market participants say 0 *?*, OPEC production will have *-2 to decline *PRO* to keep prices from *PRO*-3 eroding further.
The group plans *PRO*-1 to meet in a month *PRO*-2 to discuss production strategy for early 1990.
With prices already headed lower, news of a series of explosions at a major Phillips Petroleum Co. chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel also was bearish for prices.
Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude, analysts say 0 *?*, now the facility won't need any, at a time of already high availability.
The Phillips plant makes polyethylene, polypropylene and other plastic products.
A company official said 0 the explosions began when a seal blew out *T*-1.
Dozens of workers were injured *-1, authorities said 0 *T*-2.
There was no immediate estimate of damage from the company.
Some petroleum futures traders say 0 technical considerations now will help *PRO* to put downward pressure on futures prices.
For instance, one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they've fallen below $20 *U* a barrel.
"Our technician is a little bearish now that we've taken out $20 *U*," he said *T*-1.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
COPPER:
The selling that *T*-1 started on Friday continued yesterday.
The December contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $1.1960 *U*.
London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons.
The New York market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $1.23 *U* - a - pound level *T*-1, selling picked up as previous buyers bailed out of their positions and aggressive short sellers--*PRO*-2 anticipating further declines--moved in.
Fund selling also picked up at that point.
According to Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, the only stability to the market came when short sellers periodically moved in *PRO*-2 to cover their positions by *PRO*-3 buying contracts *T*-1.
This activity produced small rallies, which *T*-1 in turn attracted new short selling.
Mr. Savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar, which *T*-1 would normally support the U.S. copper market.
Such support usually comes from arbitragers who *T*-1 use a strong British pound *PRO*-2 to buy copper in New York.
"The sell - off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong," he said *T*-1.
Copper has been stuck *-1 in a trading range of $1.19 to $1.34 *U*.
Mr. Savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $1.04 *U*.
PRECIOUS METALS:
Platinum and palladium struggled *PRO*-2 to maintain their prices all day despite news stories *ICH*-3 over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments, which *T*-1 use both metals, showed signs of *PRO* producing extra heat.
January platinum closed down $2.80 *U* an ounce at $486.30 *U*, nearly $4 *U* above its low for the day.
December palladium was off $1.55 *U* an ounce at $137.20 *U*.
Platinum is believed *-1 to have good support around $480 *U* and palladium at around $130 *U*.
Some traders were thought *-3 to be waiting for the auto sales report, which *T*-2 will be released *-1 today.
Such sales are watched *-1 closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used *-2 in automobile catalytic converters.
Mr. Savaiko theorized that the news on cold fusion didn't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly burnt *-1 by such stories.
He said 0 the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again.
Also weighing on both metals' prices is *T*-1 the role of the chief supplier, the Soviet Union.
Many analysts believe that the Soviets' thirst for dollars *ICH*-2 this year 0 *T*-1 to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much *T*-3.
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:
Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery closed at $5.63 *U* a bushel, down half a cent, while the December wheat contract rose three - quarters of a cent to $4.0775 *U* a bushel.
Supporting prices was *T*-1 the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to the Soviet Union.
But acting as a drag on prices was *T*-1 the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt.
Strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices.
SUGAR:
World prices tumbled, mostly from their own weight, according to analysts.
The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound, down 0.37 cent.
For the past week or so, traders have been expecting India to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar, and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan.
But with no reports of either country actually entering the market, analysts said 0 *?*, futures prices became vulnerable.
Developing countries such as India, some analysts said *?*, seem *-2 to have made it *EXP*-3 a point *PRO* to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range, around 14.75 cents, *T*-4 and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range, around 13.50 cents.
But Erik Dunlaevy, a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd., said 0 the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler: Speculators, he said 0 *?*, "got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs."
A PaineWebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely *-1 to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country.
COCOA:
Futures rallied modestly.
The December contract rose $33 *U* a metric ton to $1,027 *U*, near its high for the day.
Gill & Duffus Ltd., a British cocoa - trading house, estimated that the 1989 - 90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons, down from 314,000 tons for the previous year.
Market technicians were encouraged *-1 by the price patterns, which *T*-2 in the past have preceded sharp rallies.
Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen * in the mid-1970s.
At such prices, according to Mr. Savaiko, bargain hunting and short - covering--buying back of contracts previously sold--by speculators isn't uncommon.
But Mr. Savaiko expects stepped - up producer selling at around the $1,040 to $1,050 *U* level.
He also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in New York as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move.
Sandra Kaul, research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said 0 the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the Ivory Coast, a major cocoa producer.
First Executive Corp. said 0 about 96% of the rights *PRO* to purchase its depositary shares and warrants have been exercised *-1.
Of the 17.6 million rights units issued *, just under 17 million *T*-2 were exercised *-1 before the Oct. 10 expiration of the offering, the insurance holding company said 0 *T*-3.
Remaining units will be sold *-1 to the underwriters, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Kidder, Peabody & Co., which *T*-2 will also purchase an over - allotment of 2.3 million additional units.
First Executive said 0 the offering will raise about $299 million *U*--minus underwriting fees and other expenses--that the company plans *PRO*-2 to use *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to write new life insurance and annuity business.
In addition, analysts have viewed the rights offering as a takeover defense that *T*-1 prospectively balloons the number of shares outstanding.
Each of the units consists of two warrants, each of which *T*-1 could be used *-2 *PRO* to purchase a half - share of common stock, and one depositary preference share.
Depositary shares are convertible into common stock on a 1 - to - 1 basis.
Currently, the company has about 88.1 million common shares outstanding.
In over - the - counter trading Monday, the stock closed at $10.625 *U*, off 37.5 cents.
Annualized interest rates on certain investments 0 as *T*-2 reported *-1 by the Federal Reserve Board on a weekly - average basis:
a - Discounted rate.
b - Week ended * Wednesday, October 18, 1989 and Wednesday October 11, 1989.
c - Yields, adjusted * for constant maturity.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it lowered the debt ratings of certain long - term debt held * by this company.
The debt - rating concern cited the bank's move into the Texas market, *PRO*-1 noting 0 its profitability and capital adequacy measurements will be depressed relative to the bank's past performance.
Moody's also said 0 it raised its rating on the Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank, now known * as Bank One, Texas N.A., *PRO* reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the FDIC.
Officials at the New York bank - holding company weren't available for comment on the debt - rating changes.
The Mouth is back.
Morton Downey Jr., who *T*-1 self - destructed as a talk - show host and frequently verbally abused his guests, has been signed *-2 *PRO*-3 to co-host a half - hour nightly program on the Consumer News and Business Channel, the cable channel partly owned * by the General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co.
The premiere of "Showdown," with Mr. Downey and Richard G. Carter, a columnist with the New York Daily News, is scheduled *-1 for Dec. 4 at 8 p.m.
CNBC is available to 13 million cable households.
Mr. Downey said 0 he is not going *-1 to change his style, which some critics said 0 *T*-2 was flamboyant and others deemed *T*-2 offensive.
"But I'm going *-1 to proceed in a more logical way.
I'm not going *-2 to do anything that *T*-1 is not acceptable in anyone's home.
But that doesn't mean 0 I'm not going *-1 to get angry."
Michael Eskridge, president of CNBC, said that although there will be a studio audience, viewers will no longer have *-1 to endure the shouting of "Mort! Mort! Mort!"
But just how does Mr. Downey's unorthodox style mesh with the sedate tone of CNBC's business programming *T*-2?
"Ninety percent of Mort's old show fits into our style," said *T*-1 Mr. Eskridge.
"That is consumer issues."
Mr. Downey's previous show, a one - hour shout fest, syndciated * by MCA Inc. and produced * by Quantum Media Inc., was canceled *-1 in July after advertisers and stations abandoned it.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Roche Holding AG, parent of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said 0 its group sales rose 22% in the first nine months of the year to 7.32 billion francs ($4.51 billion *U*).
The company reported good gains in all of its divisions.
Roche also said 0 it expects a "considerable rise" in 1989 group profit from the 641.5 million - franc ($396 million *U*) net in 1988.
As Helen Boehm, who *T*-1 owns an art porcelain company, sipped her luncheon cocktail, she reeled off the names of a few pals--Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Sarah Ferguson, John Kluge, Milton Petrie.
Then, *PRO*-1 flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz ("my day diamond, darling"), she told her two companions that she is on the "board" of the Vatican Museum in Rome.
As it turns out, the board has a lot of important members, including Winton Blount (former postmaster general of the U.S.), Mrs. Henry Gaisman (widow of the inventor of auto - strop razor) and Vincent Murphy (an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co.)
But Mrs. Boehm didn't mention any of them.
"Helen Boehm has a way with names," says *T*-1 James Revson, a gossip columnist for Newsday (and son of Joseph Revson, a founder of Revlon).
Like which *T*-1 are droppable and which *T*-2 are not *?*.
With the fall social season well under way, name - droppers are out in force, *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers.
But the truth is that almost everyone, from real - estate agents to city fathers, name - drops; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who *T*-1 claims 0 he lived next door to the cartoonist who *T*-2 did the Katzenjammer Kids.
(In case you have forgotten, his name was Rudolph Dirks.)
"Name - dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating," says *T*-1 Herbert Freudenberger, a New York psychoanalyst, with a high - powered clientele.
"It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society....
It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone 0 you don't know *T*-1."
Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who *T*-1 swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli.
"I was having a drink in Sardi's, when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks *T*-1.
I knew 0 it was someone important, so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough, it was Liza.
So I said, ` Hello . '
And she said, ` Hello . '
Can you imagine?
Liza said hello to me."
Some people must drop names--*PRO* call it *PRO*-1 an irresistible impulse.
"They can't help *PRO* talking about the big important people 0 they know *T*-1, even if they don't really know them," says *T*-2 Dr. Freudenberger.
Beauregard Houston - Montgomery, a New York writer who *T*-1 changed his name from William Stretch in 1980, is an inveterate name - dropper.
"I do it innately and pathologically, and while it may occasionally get me into trouble, it's also gotten me access to parties and society," he says *T*-1.
Name - dropping recently helped Mr. Houston - Montgomery *PRO*-2 crash a party 0 Fame magazine threw *T*-1 for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned * in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol.
"I guess 0 I might have asked Beauregard *PRO*-1 to leave, but he drops so many good names, 0 we decided *PRO*-2 to let him stay," says *T*-3 Steven Greenberg, publisher of Fame.
"After all, Warhol was the ultimate namedropper, *PRO*-1 dropping five a day in his diaries.
And Beauregard was mentioned twice--although very briefly and in passing."
Mr. Houston - Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine ("We've been in the columns together"), Mary Boone, a New York art dealer ("I think 0 she knows me, but I'm not sure") and Bridget Fonda, the actress ("She knows me, but we're not really the best of friends").
Mr. Revson, the gossip columnist, says 0 there are people who *T*-1 actually plan whose names they are going *-3 to drop *T*-2 before *PRO*-4 attending a party.
These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher.
"They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl, whom everybody these days apparently has heard of *T*-2 but no one really knows *T*-2," says *T*-1 Mr. Revson.
"It's the one - upsmanship of name - dropping that *T*-1 counts."
But name - dropping has other benefits, often civic.
In the name of civic pride and from the desire *PRO* to nullify a negative image, some city promoters seek *PRO*-1 to link their municipality with the most recognizable names 0 the city has *T*-2 0 *PRO* to offer *T*-4.
*PRO* Take Cleveland.
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire, because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused *-1 an urban - development grant.
Some people call it *PRO*-2 "The Mistake on the Lake"--Lake Erie, that is *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-2 helps *PRO* to point out how many important people *T*-1 came through Cleveland on their way to the top," says *T*-3 George Miller, executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign, a nonprofit organization devoted to *PRO* citing the city's strengths.
Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman's family owned a sporting - goods store in Cleveland, that the late actress Margaret Hamilton, who *T*-1 played the bad witch in "The Wizard Of Oz," once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope's father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to Severence Hall, Cleveland's main concert hall.
"Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation," Mr. Miller says *T*-1.
In Hollywood, an average family can gain cachet from *PRO*-1 moving into a home vacated * by the famous or near famous.
"Why we even just sold a three - bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able *PRO*-1 to keep the price *PRO*-4 firm in a weak real - estate market by *PRO*-2 noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there," says *T*-3 David Rambo, a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co., a Los Angeles real - estate agency.
"Most people can't even remember his name."
(It is John Hart.)
Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2 - acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced *-1 at $4 million *U* because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there.
"If Flynn hadn't lived there, the property might have been priced *-2 $1 million *U* lower," says *T*-3 Mr. Rambo, *PRO*-4 noting that Flynn's house has been bulldozed *-1, and only the swimming pool remains.
Press agents and public - relations practitioners are notorious name - droppers.
And some even do it with malice aforethought.
Len Kessler, a financial publicist in New York, sometimes uses it *PRO*-2 to get the attention of journalists who *T*-1 try *PRO*-3 to avoid him.
He says that when Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist with USA Today, hasn't returned his phone calls *T*-1, he leaves messages *ICH*-2 with Mr. Dorfman's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump, Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis.
He admits 0 he has no story on any of them on these occasions.
"But it does get him to return my calls, and it makes me feel better for the times 0 he's given me the brushoff *T*-1," Mr. Kessler says *T*-2.
There are, of course, obvious dangers to blatant, unsubstantiated name - dropping.
Jeffry Thal, a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles, warns that *PRO* dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud.
"*PRO* Get caught *-2 and you're dead in the water," says *T*-1 Mr. Thal.
Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor, a client, "hates *PRO*-2 being called *-1 *PRO*-3 ` Liz .' ...
If directors or producers phone me and say 0 they know ` Liz,' I know 0 they've never met her.
She prefers ` Elizabeth."'
In New York society, Pat Buckley, the very social wife of author William Buckley, has the nicknames "Mrs. Buckles" and "Patsy."
And her husband sometimes calls her *PRO*-1 "Ducky."
"But *PRO* call her *PRO*-2 ` Patty,' and it's a sure giveaway 0 you're not in her circle, because she doesn't use that name," says *T*-1 Joan Kron, editor - in - chief of Avenue magazine, a monthly publication sent * to all the right names.
John Spencer Churchill, a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill, former prime minister of Great Britain, isn't that impressed with most name - droppers 0 he meets *T*-1.
That's because they only drop "mere names," says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Churchill.
*PRO*-1 Currently writing his memoirs, Mr. Churchill, an artist, tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty, the oil billionnaire, were, in fact, known *-2 only by one initial, their last *T*-3.
"When you're at the club *T*-1, you ask whether they've spoken to ` G . '
Now they know who you mean *T*-1 and you know who you mean *T*-2.
But no one else does.
Now that's name - dropping, if you know what I mean *T*-1.
Amtech Systems Inc., Tempe, Ariz., said 0 its preliminary year - end results of operations indicate "substantial improvement" over the previous fiscal year.
Amtech, which *T*-1 makes an automated process system that *T*-2 improves the yields of semiconductor manufacturers, said 0 profit for the year ended * Sept. 30 rose to more than $800,000 *U* from $446,000 *U* last year.
Per - share earnings are estimated *-1 at more than 40 cents, up from 22 cents for fiscal 1988.
Total revenue is expected *-1 to double to more than $22 million *U* from $10.8 million *U*.
Amtech, which *T*-1 also provides technical temporary employment services to aerospace, defense, computer and high - tech companies in the Southwest and Baltimore - Washington areas, said 0 its final audited results are due in late November.
The company attributed the improvement to strong demand in the semiconductor equipment segment as well as the acquisition of Echelon Service Co. and the inclusion of a full year's results of operations for RTS Inc., compared with seven months' results for the prior year.
BRISTOL - MYERS SQUIBB Co . (New York) --
Gerald C. Beddall, 47 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president of the Clairol division of this pharmaceuticals and health - care company.
He succeeds C. Benjamin Brooks Jr., who *T*-1 will retire Nov. 1.
Mr. Brooks declined *PRO*-1 to give his age, but he said 0 his leaving is a normal retirement.
Mr. Beddall had been executive vice president of the division since April.
Clairol, which *T*-1 makes hair and skin products, was a division of Bristol - Myers Co. before that company's merger with Squibb Corp.
Exxon Corp. filed suit against the state of Alaska, *PRO*-1 charging 0 state officials interfered with the oil company's initial efforts *PRO* to treat last spring's giant oil spill.
The action is a counterclaim to a suit filed * by Alaska in August against Exxon and six other oil companies.
The state's suit alleges that Exxon's response to the spill failed *-1 to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound.
That suit and Exxon's countersuit were filed *-1 in a state court in Anchorage.
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims, largely because damage assessment hasn't yet been completed *-1.
Legal strategists say that damage claims against the oil giant and others could well exceed $1 billion *U*.
Litigation, if *PRO*-1 not settled *-2 out of court, could drag on for years.
Exxon said in its suit that it will seek reimbursement from the state for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims 0 it says 0 *T*-1 resulted from the state's conduct.
The oil company claims that Alaskan officials prevented Exxon from *PRO*-1 spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped * when one of its tankers ran into an underwater reef *T*-2.
Craig Tillery, an Alaska assistant attorney general, said in an interview last night that Exxon's accusations "are not new.
Exxon has made them before, at which point the state demonstrated 0 they were untrue *T*-1.
The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim."
Since the spill last March, Exxon and the state have been wrangling over whether *PRO* spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after the spill, when the weather was clear and calm *T*-2, would have helped *PRO*-1 limit the environmental damage.
Exxon claims that use of dispersants, which *T*-1 break an oil slick into microscopic droplets, was a crucial part of its immediate - response plan and that state officials banned their use during the two days of fair weather following the spill.
The oil company claims that it had permission *ICH*-1 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill *PRO* to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard.
The state's opposition to the use of dispersants, Exxon says 0 *?*, caused the Coast Guard "to delay *PRO*-2 granting permission."
Alaskan and Coast Guard officials say 0 Exxon's charges aren't relevant because tests conducted * during the first two days following the spill showed that the dispersant wasn't working anyway.
Use of dispersants was approved *-1 when a test on the third day showed some positive results *T*-2, officials said 0 *T*-3.
At age eight, Josephine Baker was sent *-1 by her mother to a white woman's house *PRO*-2 to do chores in exchange for meals and a place 0 *PRO* to sleep *T*-3--a place in the basement with the coal.
At age 19, she was a Paris sensation, *PRO*-1 transformed * from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade.
It is the stuff of dreams, but also of traumas.
Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters.
And, for Ms. Baker, the ride was far from over.
Her bare breasts, her dancing, her voice, her beauty and, perhaps most famously, her derriere, were prominent attractions, but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.
Bricktop, another American black woman who *T*-1 found a measure of fame in Paris, said: "I don't think 0 I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life *T*-2 was more complicated than Josephine's."
Men were a constant complication.
Baker had lots of them.
But she didn't trust them and didn't reward trust.
As she saw one key love affair, the problem wasn't her infidelity, it was his jealousy.
Her appetite for children also was large.
She adopted 12 of assorted races, *PRO*-1 naming them *PRO*-4 the Rainbow Tribe, and driving her husband first to despair and then to Argentina.
She made money, but spent more.
Friends pitched in.
Finally, Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved her with the offer of a house in Monaco.
Another lifelong complication, as Phyllis Rose makes *?* clear in "Jazz Cleopatra: Josephine Baker in Her Time" (Doubleday, 321 pages, $22.50 *U*), was racism.
Baker had the good luck *PRO* to arrive in 1925 Paris, where blacks had become exotic *T*-1.
African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age 0 *T*-2 to be inspired *-1 by blacks.
*PRO* To be exotic was *PRO* to be patronized as well as prized *-1, but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.
Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged *-1 too dark for an all - black chorus line (performing of course for all - white audiences) *T*-2.
Paris loved her at first sight.
"She just wiggled her fanny and all the French fell in love with her," sniffed *T*-1 the literary world's Maria Jolas, not entirely inaccurately.
"One can hardly overemphasize the importance of her rear end," Ms. Rose writes *T*-1.
Ms. Rose, who *T*-1 teaches literature at Wesleyan University, quickly proceeds *PRO*-2 to overemphasize, *PRO*-2 claiming that Baker's dancing "had uncovered a new region for desire" and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous.
"Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes that *T*-1 undermine what *T*-2 is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.
It *EXP*-2 is easy *PRO* to see why Baker, a free spirit who *T*-1 broke many of the restraints 0 convention places *T*-3 on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage *T*-4.
Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.
Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term.
*PRO* To find parallels, other than sexual appeal, with Cleopatra, requires an equal stretch.
Baker was 68 years old when she died in Paris *T*-2, two days after the sold - out opening of her newest show: a movie - like ending to what *T*-1 was a cinematic life.
In fact, Ms. Baker played scenes *ICH*-2 in Casablanca that *T*-1 could have made it into "Casablanca."
During World War II, her uncomplicated view of life led her to the conclusion that the Nazis were evil and must be resisted *-1, a decision made * by only about 2% of French citizens.
She was devoted to Charles de Gaulle's cause, *PRO*-1 accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk *PRO*-2 to become first a spy and then a one - woman USO tour for the forces of Free France.
In Humphrey Bogart's nightclub, Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in "La Marseillaise" *PRO*-1 to drown out the Nazis.
The night 0 the Germans occupied all of France *T*-1, Baker performed in Casablanca.
The Free French wore black arm bands, and when she sang "J'ai deux amours" *T*-1 they wept.
Ms. Rose is best on the early years and World War II.
In her introduction, Ms. Rose writes that she feels 0 she has much in common with Baker, but as "Jazz Cleopatra" goes on, it seems *-1 more rushed, as though the author were growing less interested.
It doesn't help that sometimes Ms. Rose's language fails *-1 to deliver the effect 0 she appears *-3 to want *T*-2.
One chapter opens: "World War II was not one of France's glorious moments."
Elsewhere, in an attempt *PRO* to explain without *PRO*-2 stating it plainly *PPA*-5 that Baker had a large gay following later in her career when she was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer *T*-3, Ms. Rose writes: "She was a female impersonator who *T*-1 happened *-4 to be a woman."
One devoted fan who *T*-1 fell under Baker's spell in 1963 and began *-2 collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond.
In "Josephine Baker" (Jonathan Cape, 304 pages, $35 *U*), which *T*-1 was published *-2 in Britain last year and distributed *-2 in the U.S. this month, Mr. Hammond has used his collection *PRO*-3 to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star.
The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read, but the pictures make her magnetism clear and help *PRO* explain why Ernest Hemingway called Baker *PRO*-4 "The most sensational woman 0 anybody ever saw *T*-2 *T*-3.
Or ever will."

Norimasa Furuta, president of Japan's Mazda Motor Corp., said 0 the Japanese car maker is planning joint production with Ford Motor Co. in Europe ahead of the European Community's 1992 integration.
Mr. Furuta didn't disclose further details of the arrangement at a news conference, but said 0 the project would be undertaken *-1 with Ford's European subsidiary.
A Ford official confirmed in Tokyo that the U.S. motor vehicle maker is studying such an arrangement.

American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said 0 it will spend $20 million *U* *PRO*-1 to build a factory in Guadalajara, Mexico, 0 *T*-2 to make telephone answering machines.
Construction of the 265,000 - square - foot facility will begin next year, with production expected *-1 to start in late 1991.
When *PRO*-2 fully operational *T*-1, the Guadalajara factory will employ about 1,500 workers and have annual operating expenses of $5 million to $6 million *U*.
An AT&T representative said that the Guadalajara factory will make a full line of answering machines.
AT&T already has a factory in Matamoros, Mexico, 0 *T*-1 to make electrical devices.
It also purchases data systems products from a manufacturer based * in Monterrey.
The bond market, which *T*-1 sometimes thrives on bad news, cheered yesterday's stock market sell - off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker.
Early in the day, bonds rose modestly on economists' forecasts that this week's slate of economic data will portray an economy headed * for trouble.
Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort *PRO* to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession.
For example, today the Department of Commerce is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to release the September durable goods report.
The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report is for a 1.2% drop in September orders.
That would follow a 3.9% advance in August.
Bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower *T*-1.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91.
"Bond investors have been watching stocks closely," said *T*-1 Joel Marver, chief fixed - income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group.
"When you get a big sell - off in equities *T*-3, money starts *-4 to shift into bonds," which *T*-2 are considered *-1 safer, he said 0 *T*-5.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond ended about 1/2 point higher, or up about $5 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, while the yield slid to 7.93% from 7.98% Friday.
Municipals ended *PRO*-1 mixed, while mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose.
Prices of high - yield, high - risk corporate securities ended *PRO*-1 unchanged.
In more evidence of the growing division between "good" and "bad" junk bonds, a $150 million *U* issue by Imo Industries Inc. was snapped up *-1 by investors while underwriters for Beatrice Co.'s $350 million *U* issue are considering *PRO*-2 restructuring the deal *PRO*-3 to attract buyers.
In the Treasury market, analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news.
"On the negative side, the market will be affected *-1 by constant supply in all sectors of the market," said *T*-2 William M. Brachfeld, economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
"On the other hand, we have economic news that *T*-1 is {expected *-2 to be} relatively positive for the bond market.
We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields," he said *T*-1.
Today, the Treasury will sell $10 billion *U* of new two - year notes.
Tomorrow, Resolution Funding Corp., a division of a new government agency created * *PRO* to bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds *T*-1.
So far, money managers and other bond buyers haven't shown much interest in the Refcorp bonds.
Analysts have mixed views about the two - year note auction.
While some say 0 the auction should proceed smoothly, others contend that yesterday's sale of $2.58 billion *U* of asset - backed securities by Ford Motor Credit Corp. may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from the government's note sale.
The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co. made its debut in the asset - backed securities market with the second - largest issue in the market's four - year history.
The company offered securities backed * by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed * by First Boston Corp.
The issue yields 8.90% and carries a guarantee covering 9% of the deal from the company.
First Boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort *PRO* to place the huge offering.
The issue was offered *-1 at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two - year Treasurys.
The only asset - backed deal larger than Ford's was a $4 billion *U* offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986.
Treasury Securities
Treasury bonds were 1/8 to 1/2 point higher yesterday in light trading.
The benchmark 30 - year bond ended at a price of 102 3/32, compared with 101 17/32 Friday.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 late at 100 17/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.90%, compared with 100 3/32 *PRO* to yield 7.97%.
The latest two - year notes were quoted *-1 late at 100 28/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.84%.
Short - term rates rose yesterday at the government's weekly Treasury bill auction, compared with the previous bill sale.
The Treasury sold $7.81 billion *U* of three - month bills with an average discount rate of 7.52%, the highest since the average of 7.63% at the auction on Oct. 10.
The $7.81 billion *U* of six - month Treasury bills were sold *-1 with an average discount rate of 7.50%, the highest since the average of 7.60% at the Oct. 10 auction.
The rates were up from last week's auction, when they were 7.37% and 7.42%, respectively *T*-1.
Here are *T*-2 auction details:
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360 - day year, while the coupon - equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365 - day year.
Both issues are dated *-1 Oct. 26.
The 13 - week bills mature Jan. 25, 1990, and the 26 - week bills mature April 26, 1990.
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporates closed about 1/4 point higher in quiet trading.
In the junk bond market, Imo Industries' issue of 12 - year debentures, considered * to be one of the market's high - quality credits, was priced *-1 at par *PRO*-2 to yield 12%.
Peter Karches, managing director at underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co., said 0 the issue was oversubscribed.
"It's a segmented market, and if you have a good, strong credit, people have an appetite for it," he said *T*-1.
Morgan Stanley is expected *-1 to price another junk bond deal, $350 million *U* of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc., next Tuesday.
In light of the recent skittishness in the high - yield market, junk bond analysts and traders expect other high - yield deals to be sweetened or restructured *-2 before they are offered *-1 to investors.
In the case of Beatrice, Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering *PRO*-1 restructuring the reset mechanism on the $200 million *U* portion of the offering.
Under the originally contemplated terms of the offering, the notes would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys.
Under the new plan being considered *, the notes would reset annually at a rate 0 *PRO* to maintain a market value of 101 *T*-1.
Price talk calls for the reset notes to be priced *-1 at a yield of between 13 1/4% and 13 1/2% *U*.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced * and talk of several more deals in today's session.
The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $1.2 billion *U* of Remic securities in three issues, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. offered a $250 million *U* Remic backed * by 9% 15 - year securities.
Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold * by thrifts.
Traders said 0 thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks.
In the mortgage pass - through sector, active issues rose but trailed gains in the Treasury market.
Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery were quoted *-1 late yesterday at 98 10/32, up 10/32; and Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 1/2, up 1/4.
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 8.36% to a 12 - year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points.
Municipals
A $575 million *U* San Antonio, Texas, electric and gas system revenue bond issue dominated the new issue sector.
The refunding issue, which *T*-1 had been in the wings for two months, was one of the chief offerings overhanging the market and limiting price appreciation.
But *PRO* alleviating that overhang failed *-1 to stimulate much activity in the secondary market, where prices were off 1/8 to up 3/8 point *T*-2.
An official with lead underwriter First Boston said 0 orders for the San Antonio bonds were "on the slow side."
He attributed that to the issue's aggressive pricing and large size, as well as the general lethargy in the municipal marketplace.
In addition, he noted 0 *?*, the issue would normally be the type purchased * by property and casualty insurers, but recent disasters, such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake, have stretched insurers' resources and damped their demand for bonds.
A $137.6 million *U* Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue appeared *-1 to be off to a good start.
The issue was oversubscribed and "doing very well," according to an official with lead underwriter Morgan Stanley.
Activity quieted in the New York City bond market, where heavy investor selling last week drove yields on the issuer's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point *T*-1.
Foreign Bonds
Japanese government bonds ended lower after the dollar rose modestly against the yen.
The turnaround in the dollar fueled bearish sentiment about Japan's bond market.
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 95.39, off 0.28.
The yield rose to 5.38%.
West German bond prices ended lower after a day of aimless trading.
The benchmark 7% bond due October 1999 fell 0.20 point to 99.80 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.03%, while the 6 3/4% notes due July 1994 fell 0.10 to 97.65 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.34%.
British government bonds ended slightly higher in quiet trading as investors looked ahead to today's British trade report.
The benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond due 2003 / 2007 rose 1/8 to 111 21/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.11%, while the 12% issue of 1995 rose 3/32 to 103 23/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 11.01%.
New Canaan Investments Inc. said 0 it closed the acquisition of Carr - Lowrey Glass Co. from Newell Co., a Freeport, Ill., maker of *PRO* do - it - yourself home products.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Carr - Lowrey, a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and toiletries industries, had sales *ICH*-1 last year of about $40 million *U*.
New Canaan Investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry.
Tokyo stocks closed firmer Monday, with the Nikkei index making its fifth consecutive daily gain.
Stocks also rose in London, while the Frankfurt market was mixed.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index added 99.14 to 35585.52.
The index moved above 35670 at midmorning, *PRO*-1 nearly reaching the record of 35689.98 set * Sept. 28.
But the market lost part of the early gains on index - linked investment trust fund selling.
In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 1.08 points to 35586.60.
On Monday, traders noted that some investors took profits against the backdrop of the Nikkei's fast - paced recovery following its plunge last Monday in reaction to the Oct. 13 drop in New York stock prices.
But overall buying interest remained strong through Monday, with many observers saying 0 they expect the Nikkei to continue with moderate gains this week.
Turnover remained relatively small.
Volume on the first section was estimated *-1 at 600 million shares, down from 1.03 billion shares Friday.
The Tokyo stock price index of first section issues was up 7.81 at 2687.53.
Relatively stable foreign currency dealings Monday were viewed *-1 favorably by market players, traders said 0 *T*-2.
But institutional investors may wait a little longer *PRO*-1 to appraise the direction of the U.S. monetary policy and the dollar, traders said 0 *T*-2.
Hiroyuki Wada, general manager of the stock department at Okasan Securities, said 0 Monday's trading was "unfocused."
He said 0 investors were picking individual stocks based on specific incentives and the likelihood of a wider price increase over the short term.
The selective approach blurred themes such as domestic - demand issues, large - capitalization issues or high - technology shares, which *T*-1 had been providing at least some trading direction over the past few weeks, Mr. Wada said 0 *T*-2.
Investors took profits on major construction shares, which *T*-1 advanced last week, *PRO*-2 shifting their attention to some midsize companies such as Aoki Corp., Tobishima and Maeda.
Aoki gained 60 yen to 1,480 yen ($10.40 *U*).
Some pharmaceutical shares were popular on rumors related * to new products 0 *T*-3 to be introduced *-1 at a cancer conference that *T*-2 opened in Nagoya.

Mochida advanced 40 to 4,440.
Fujisawa continued *-1 to attract investors because of strong earning prospects stemming from a new immune control agent.
Fujisawa gained 50 to 2,060.
Kikkoman was up 30 to 1,600, *PRO*-1 receiving investor interest for its land property holdings near Tokyo, a trader said 0 *T*-2.
London prices closed modestly higher in the year's thinnest turnover, a condition that *T*-1 underscored a lack of conviction ahead of a U.K. balance of payments report Tuesday.
Limited volume ahead of the September trade data showed 0 the market is nervous, but dealers added that the day's modest gains also signaled some support for London equities.
They pegged the support largely to anticipation that Britain's current account imbalance can't be much worse than the near record deficits seen * in July and August.
"It's a case of the market being too high 0 *T*-2 to buy and too afraid 0 *T*-3 to sell," a senior dealer with Kleinwort Benson Securities said *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-1's better *PRO* to wait."
The Financial Times 100 - share index finished 10.6 points higher at 2189.7.
The 30 - share index closed 11.6 points higher at 1772.6.
Volume was 276.8 million shares, beneath the year's previous low of 280.5 million shares Sept. 25, the session before the August trade figures were released *-1.
Analysts' expectations suggest a September current account deficit of #1.6 billion *U* ($2.54 billion *U*), compared with August's #2.0 billion *U* deficit.
Dealers, however, said 0 forecasts are broadly divergent with estimates ranging between #1 billion *U* and #2 billion *U*.
"The range of expectations is so broad," a dealer at another major U.K. brokerage firm said *?*, "0 the deficit may have *-2 to be nearer or above #2 billion *U* for it to have any impact on the market."
Lucas Industries, a British automotive and aerospace concern, rose 13 pence to 614 pence after it said 0 its pretax profit for the year rose 28%.
Share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in quiet dealings after *PRO*-1 recovering most of their early losses.
The DAX index eased 0.99 point *PRO*-1 to end at 1523.22 after *PRO*-1 falling 5.5 points early in the session.
Brokers said 0 the declines early in the day were partly caused *-1 by losses of the ruling Christian - Democratic Union in communal elections in the state of Baden - Wuerttemberg.
The start of a weeklong conference by the IG Metall metal worker union in Berlin is drawing attention to the impending wage negotiations, which *T*-1 could boost companies' personnel costs next year, they said 0 *T*-2.
But there was little selling pressure, and even small orders at the lower levels sufficed *PRO*-1 to bring the market back to Friday's opening levels.
Traders said 0 the thin trading volume points to continued uncertainty by most investors following last Monday's record 13% loss.
The market is still 4% short of its level before the plunge, and analysts aren't sure how long it will take *T*-1 until the DAX has closed that gap.
But Norbert Braeuer, chief trader at Hessische Landesbank Girozentrale (Helaba), said 0 he expects share prices to move upward in the coming weeks.
Banking stocks were the major gainers Monday amid hope that interest rates have peaked, as Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank added 4 marks each to 664 marks ($357 *U*) and 326 marks, respectively.
Commerzbank gained 1 to 252.5.
Auto shares were mixed, as Daimler - Benz firmed 2 to 723, Bayerische Motoren Werke lost the same amount to 554, and Volkswagen inched down 1.4 to 451.6.
Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Amsterdam, lower in Zurich, Stockholm and Milan, mixed in Brussels and unchanged in Paris.

Ingersoll Publications Co. agreed *PRO*-1 to buy the New Haven Register in a transaction valued * at $275 million *U* from Goodson Newspaper Group Inc.
As part of the agreement, Goodson also terminated the contract under which Ingersoll manages Goodson's 66 newspapers *T*-2, *PRO*-3 ending a long association between the two companies that *T*-1 has turned increasingly bitter recently.
Goodson has accused Ingersoll of *PRO*-1 paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun.
Under the terms of the accord, Ingersoll will pay about $255 million *U* for the Register, a daily that Goodson bought *T*-1 for about $170 million *U* in 1986.
Goodson will pay the additional $20 million *U* in settlement of the management contract.
Goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of Ingersoll 0 *T*-1 to run the Goodson papers.
Both executives left the company after clashes with Chairman Ralph Ingersoll Jr.
Goodson, which *T*-2 is based *-1 here, will use part of the proceeds *PRO*-3 to pay down debt associated * with its purchase of the Morristown Daily Record for $155 million *U* in 1987.
The New Jersey paper, like the New Haven, Conn., paper, was purchased *-1 by Ingersoll on Goodson's behalf as part of the management contract.
Industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high, *PRO* causing a strain on Goodson's finances.
Investment bankers familiar with the company said 0 Goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $190 million *U* and may have *-1 to sell additional newspapers.
David N. Hurwitz, president and chief operating officer of Goodson, said in a telephone interview that the company doesn't currently have any plans *PRO* to sell additional newspapers.
Goodson said 0 David Carr, former president of Ingersoll Publications, and Ray Cockburn, former senior vice president, would head the new in - house management team at Goodson, which *T*-1 had revenue of $225 million *U* in 1988.
The association between the two companies stretches back thirty years to a friendship between television producer Mark Goodson and Ingersoll founder Ralph Ingersoll.
The latter's son, Ralph Ingersoll Jr., took over the company and has been managing the Goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for Goodson.
But in recent years, Mr. Ingersoll began *-1 focusing more on *PRO*-2 expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm Warburg, Pincus & Co.
Ingersoll has 28 dailies and 200 other non-daily papers in the U.S. and Europe.
The company said 0 its revenue will exceed $750 million *U* this year.
Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said in a statement that the company is "delighted by the conclusion of the Goodson relationship" and will be able *PRO*-1 to "concentrate all our energies" on Ingersoll's own papers.
Mr. Goodson, in his own statement, was less upbeat, *PRO*-2 saying "unfortunately over the past few years, it *EXP*-3 has become increasingly clear that Ralph and I have different agendas," and that he feels "more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility *T*-1 is in the Goodson papers.

When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago *T*-1, they started life in Los Angeles with only $400 *U*.
They'd actually left the Soviet Union with $480 *U*, but during a stop in Italy Ms. Volokh dropped $80 *U* on a black velvet suit.
Not surprisingly, she quickly adapted to the American way.
Three months after she arrived in L.A. she spent $120 *U* 0 she didn't have *T*-1 for a hat.
("A turban," she specifies *T*-1, "though it wasn't the time for that 14 years ago.
But I loved turbans.")
Since then she has become wealthy.
Her husband and older son--a computer prodigy profiled * in The Wall Street Journal in 1981, when he was 13 *T*-1--run a software company with expected sales this year of $10 million *U*.
Most recently, she has become the publisher of Movieline, a four - year - old Los Angeles magazine that *T*-1 began national distribution last month, with an initial press run of 100,000 copies.
*PRO*-1 Distributed *-2 by the Hearst Corp.'s Eastern News, the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair's gossipy archness and Premiere's earnest delving into behind - the - scenes minutiae, with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter.
It's being sold *-1 through bookstores, newsstands and some video stores.
Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman, she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair that *T*-2 seem perfectly suited *-3 to capitalism as it is practiced *-1 in Hollywood.
Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev, when she lived with her parents, her husband and her two sons in a 2 1/2 - room apartment in what she calls *T*-1 *PRO*-4 "silent internal immigration," *PRO*-2 dreaming of escape *T*-3.
Now, for example, she owns 48 hats.
However, she remembers the lean years and recalls with relish *PRO*-1 wearing her first major American purchase--that turban 10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her if it was a Chanel.
With obvious satisfaction, she says 0 she told him: "No darling, I just give it a Chanel look."
She keeps track of the rest of her hats by *PRO*-1 stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox.
Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona, along with the many ultra-thin Capri cigarettes 0 she smokes *T*-1, the parties 0 she throws *T*-2 for 500 people, the Chekovian feasts 0 she offers guests *T*-3 at her weekend place in Santa Barbara?
"No, darling," she said *T*-1 recently in her fluent, slightly affected English, during a trip East 0 *PRO* to promote Movieline's national expansion *T*-2.
"You have *-2 to be born *-1 with it.
I used *-1 to wear hats in Russia, but I had *-2 to make them and my dresses.
On the hat side I wasn't getting what I wanted *T*-1."
*PRO*-2 Now 48 years old, Ms. Volokh has definite ideas about what she wants *T*-1.
At Movieline, she wants "specific paragraphing, specific tone, a specific attitude--bright and bold and tongue - in - cheek."
In restaurants (in this case, the Russian Samovar, a New York restaurant operated * by and for Soviet emigres), she didn't want the chirpy, folkish music bouncing through the room.
"You people here think 0 this is Russian music," she said *T*-1 with disdain, and called over to the waitress: "Could you turn it off?"
That done *, Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes 0 she feels 0 she was born *-1 with *T*-2: an understanding of food, business, Russian culture, human nature, and parties.
"Parties are rather a state of mind," she said *T*-2, *PRO*-3 pausing *PRO*-4 only to taste *RNR*-1 and pass judgment on *RNR*-1 the Georgian shashlik ("a little well done, but very good").
"If you are born *PRO*-1 to give parties, you give parties.
Even in Russia we managed *PRO*-1 to give parties.
In Los Angeles, in our lean years, we gave parties."
As publisher of a magazine devoted * to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies, Ms. Volokh sees her party - giving as an important part of business.
She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people, but prefers more intimate gatherings.
"At American cocktail parties everyone's always looking over your shoulder *PRO*-1 to see who they can talk to *T*-2 next.
I like rather tea, because it is at the end of the day."
She serves high Russian tea, at 5 p.m.
"It's supposed *-1 to be later but I just moved it.
In Los Angeles, it *EXP*-1's important *PRO* to catch people just after work."
She also frequently invites directors, producers, actors, writers and other show business people for "coffee and clips in the pleasure dome."
Guests bring movies on tape, and show their favorite three - to - five minute segments on the screen that *T*-1 unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs' art - nouveau library ("the pleasure dome").
They eat "sinful and sensual things"--and explain their clips.
"It's very revealing and soul baring," said *T*-1 Ms. Volokh.
The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up *-2 by an old friend of the Volokhs, Boris Krutchensky (who *T*-1 has the title of co-publisher), and Laurie Halpern Smith, now the magazine's co-editor.
Mr. Krutchensky approached Ms. Volokh five years ago about *PRO* backing the publication, which *T*-1 started out as a listing guide.
She was interested only if she could guide it editorially as well.
"Anne doesn't believe in blandness," said *T*-1 Ms. Smith.
"She wants things to be exciting.
And she has this inexhaustible energy.
She'll think of an idea 0 the editorial people think 0 *T*-1 is impossible, then she'll have us make it work."
In fact, Ms. Volokh wasn't just a rich lady who *T*-1 needed a hobby.
Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist, *PRO*-1 writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia.
Those columns--vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice on how *PRO* to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals *T*-1--became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook, "The Art of Russian Cuisine," brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co.
"I don't trust people who *T*-1 don't eat," said *T*-2 Ms. Volokh, though she herself stopped *-3 eating lunch a few years ago *PRO*-3 to drop 25 pounds.
"*PRO* Look at Dostoevski and Kafka.
No one ever eats in their books and *PRO* look at them....
Tolstoy's characters eat, Pushkin's, Gogol's."
In her cookbook, which Macmillan is bringing *T*-1 out in soft cover this month (with the blini recipe revised *-2 so it works), she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature: Pushkin on blini, Goncharov on piroghi.
In life, she offers practical dieting advice: "*PRO* Divide your meals into important and unimportant.
In a great restaurant, *PRO* don't deprive yourself.
The other meals don't matter."
*PRO*-1 Amusing as she is *?*, and frivolous as she can seem *-2 *?*, this is a serious person with some difficult memories.
She was the child of relative privilege.
Her mother was a translator; her father was "the eternal vice director."
"I emigrated *PRO*-1 to wear better hats, do better parties," she said *T*-2 with a giggle.
"But we shouldn't leave out political reasons, number one.
You try *PRO*-1 to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances.
One cannot imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives *T*-2 *T*-1."
By 1973, after their second child was born *-1, it *EXP*-2 had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir, a computer scientist, that they wanted *PRO*-3 to leave the U.S.S.R.
Ms. Volokh quit her job, *PRO*-1 to remove herself from the public eye.
The wait was miserable.
Before *PRO*-1 granting Ms. Volokh's parents a visa, the government required her mother *PRO*-3 to obtain permission from her first husband, whom she had divorced *T*-2 38 years earlier.
Mr. Volokh was fired *-1 from his job, and had *-1 to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co-workers, accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities.
The Volokhs were afraid that they'd end up like a friend of theirs who *T*-1'd applied for a visa and waited for 10 years, *PRO*-2 having been demoted *-3 from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk.
They didn't.
Their visa came in relatively short order, and they moved to Los Angeles.
Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field, but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation - as translator for a Russian who *T*-1 spoke fluent English.
"That's always looking back," she said *T*-1.
"I wanted *PRO*-1 to be in business."
On the way to that goal, she received her first U.S. paycheck for *PRO*-1 proofreading a book of Polish poetry, attended secretarial school, then went *PRO*-1 to work for a fund - raising organization.
Soon she was running the office.
When her husband and son founded their computer company, Vesoft, *T*-1 she worked as business manager, bookkeeper and publicist.
Now Movieline is located *-1 in the same building as Vesoft.
"Things work out unexpectedly in life," said *T*-1 Ms. Volokh.
"You never know if you'll be chosen *-1 *PRO*-2 to be the scapegoat or the lucky one.
We were lucky.
Kurzweil Music Systems Inc. said 0 it retained Kidder, Peabody & Co. 0 *T*-1 to study financial alternatives, including the possible sale of the financially struggling company.
Kurzweil, Waltham, Mass., makes digital electronic keyboard instruments used * by professional recording musicians.
It recently introduced a line for the home market.
However, Raymond C. Kurzweil, chairman and chief executive, said "The company continues *-1 to require additional funding *PRO*-2 to realize the potential of its technology."
In the year's first six months, Kurzweil had a loss of $6.9 million *U* on sales of $11.2 million *U*.
Last month its president, John S. Donnelly, resigned *PRO*-1 citing "management differences" with Mr. Kurzweil.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said 0 it will lay off 75 to 85 technicians here, *PRO* effective Nov. 1.
The workers install, maintain and repair its private branch exchanges, which *T*-1 are large intracompany telephone networks.
Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume.
September program trading amounted to 13.8% of average daily New York Stock Exchange volume of 151.8 million shares, the largest percentage since the exchange began *-1 making such figures public in July 1988.
A daily average of 20.9 million shares *ICH*-1 traded in program strategies in September, the second - highest level ever.
The highest level was in June 1989, when a daily average of 22.1 million shares traded in program strategies *T*-1.
Average daily trading volume in June of 180.3 million shares was considerably higher than in September.
Program trading amounted to 12.3% of average daily volume in June.
The Big Board says 0 program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more stocks.
The most controversial of these is stock - index arbitrage, in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock - index futures 0 *T*-2 to lock in profits *T*-1.
It's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market.
Salomon Brothers Inc. was the top program trader in September, but most of the firm's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock - index arbitrage.
Overall, Salomon reported program trading volume of 75.2 million shares.
The top stock - index arbitrage firm last month was Morgan Stanley & Co.
Of Morgan Stanley's 66.8 million shares in program trades for the month, 53.1 million *T*-1 were in stock - index arbitrage trades.
Behind second - place Morgan Stanley were *T*-1 Kidder, Peabody & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit.
Are consumers too deep in hock?
A lot of observers think so, and, if they're right, the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt *-1.
A sudden, forced cutback by consumers, who *T*-1 normally account for about two - thirds of economic activity, would damp the economy at a time when plant - and - equipment spending is slowing and deficit - racked governments can't readily take up the slack *T*-2.
And another wave of bad loans would further batter many already - shaky lending institutions.
The worriers cite some worrisome trends.
During the almost seven - year - old economic expansion, inflation - adjusted gross national product, disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30%, but inflation - adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66%.
And the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income--personal income after taxes--has hit a high of about 18 1/2%.
However, these figures don't seem *-1 to worry Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board.
In a paper presented * at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences."
He adds: "We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, *T*-1 could persist for a while."
But what about the debt burden?
Mr. Durkin doubts that "there is some magic level" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems *T*-1."
And, "more importantly," he says *T*-1, "the debt burden measured * other ways is not really in uncharted waters."
The chart below shows why (*PRO* see accompanying illustration--WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).
The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed *-1.
Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier," Mr. Durkin says 0 *T*-1.
He notes that some "revolving credit - card credit is actually convenience credit" being used simply as a handy way of *PRO* paying bills rather than a handy way of *PRO* borrowing.
In addition, he says 0 *?*, "longer maturities on automobile *RNR*-1 and other forms of installment *RNR*-1 credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of repayments and the accompanying payment burden."
And if you "consider the changing distribution of credit," Mr. Durkin says 0 *?*, "much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by higher - income families," that is, "those probably best able *PRO* to handle it."
*PRO*-1 Citing figures on home - equity loans, he notes that "11% of homeowners had home - equity credit accounts, but the proportion rises to 16% of homeowners in the $45,000-$60,000 *U* income range and 23% of homeowners with income above $60,000 *U*."
And much home - equity credit is used *-1 conservatively.
"The most frequent use is home improvement, which *T*-1 presumably improves the value of the property," Mr. Durkin says *T*-2.
So, it *EXP*-1 isn't surprising that consumer - credit delinquencies at banks remain, as the chart shows 0 *?*, reassuringly below some earlier highs (*PRO* see accompanying illustration--WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).
A severe recession could, of course, raise delinquency rates, but so far the current levels of consumer debt don't seem *-1 to loom as a major threat.
In fact, the current weakness in auto buying and department - store sales and the gradual upturn in the household saving rate suggest that consumers, conservative as ever, are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly.
In July, consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987.
"Consumers appear *-1 unwilling *PRO*-2 to add to their leverage *PRO*-4 to support their spending," Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, says *T*-3.
"As a result, household debt appears *-1 to be stabilizing at around 63% of GNP."
Consumers, credit cards in hand, aren't running amok through the shopping malls--or putting the economy at any great risk.
Tandy Corp. said 0 it won't join U.S. Memories, the group that *T*-1 seeks *PRO*-2 to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips.
Tandy's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories.
Last month, Apple Computer Inc. said that it wouldn't invest in the group.
Apple said that its money would be better spent *-1 in areas such as research and development.
U.S. Memories is seeking major investors 0 *T*-1 to back its attempt *PRO* to crack the $10 billion *U* market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market dominated * by the Japanese.
Those chips were in dire shortage last year, *PRO* hurting many U.S. computer companies that *T*-1 couldn't get sufficient Japanese - supplied chips.
Tandy said 0 its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million *U* investment 0 U.S. Memories is seeking *T*-1 from each investor.
"At this time, we elected *PRO*-1 not to get involved because we have been able *PRO*-2 to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule," said *T*-3 Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning.
Sanford Kane, U.S. Memories president, said 0 the decision was "disappointing," but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure.
"I would like *PRO*-2 to have had them," he said *T*-1.
But "they weren't on my list of companies who *T*-1 were critical *PRO*-2 to be a part of it."
Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June, when the group was formed *-1 by seven electronics companies: Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.; Hewlett - Packard Co.; Intel Corp.; International Business Machines Corp.; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp *T*-2.
Mr. Kane said 0 he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week.
U.S. Memories needs a catalyst, he said 0 *?*, 0 *T*-1 to inspire others *PRO*-3 to join.
But so far, most potential participants haven't decided.
Sun Microsystems Inc. said 0 it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans *PRO*-1 to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said 0 it was waiting *PRO*-1 to see U.S. Memories' business plan.
Personal - computer maker AST Research Inc. said 0 it is still studying the situation.
A Compaq Computer Corp. spokeswoman said that the company hasn't made a decision yet, although "it isn't under active consideration.
A federal judge in Manhattan has entered a judgment requiring a Chicago organized crime figure *PRO*-2 to pay the government $250,000 *U*, representing alleged profits 0 he gained *T*-1 from his involvement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier said 0 it was the first time ever that the government had obtained any disgorgement from an organized crime figure indicted * under the civil racketeering law *T*-1.
Joseph Lombardo, who the government alleged 0 *T*-1 was the "captain" of organized crime in Chicago, was one of numerous defendants in the government's sweeping racketeering suit against the Teamsters.
In the suit, filed * in June 1988, the government accused the union's leadership of *PRO*-1 depriving its 1.6 million members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering.
Among other things, the government claimed that organized crime figures had routinely handpicked the union's top officials.
U.S. District Judge David Edelstein also permanently enjoined Mr. Lombardo from any future dealings with the Teamsters or any other labor union.
Mr. Lombardo, the last of the defendants 0 *T*-1 to settle the suit, agreed *PRO*-2 to pay the government the $250,000 *U* within one week.
Eastman Kodak Co., *PRO*-2 seeking *PRO*-3 to position itself in the potentially huge high - definition television market, unveiled a converter that *T*-1 can transform conventional motion - picture film into high - definition video.
The move also helps the Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant *PRO*-4 ensure that its motion - picture film business--for which it holds a virtual monopoly *T*-2, *PRO*-1 supplying every Hollywood movie company--isn't made *-3 obsolete by the upstart HDTV business.
While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded *-1 by the infant HDTV industry as a way of *PRO* increasing the number of high - quality shows that *T*-3 can be seen *-2 on the new medium.
"The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along," says *T*-1 David Niles, president of Eleven Twenty Five Productions Inc., a New York pioneer in high - definition programming.
He notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin *-1 replacing their TV sets with HDTVs.
Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot * in high - definition.
And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high - definition software development.
It's estimated that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing.
Kodak says 0 its new CCD HDTV converter will help *PRO* alleviate the problem by *PRO*-2 allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot * in 35mm motion - picture film into high - definition video.
Consumers will be able *PRO*-2 to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits 0 the high - tech medium offers *T*-1.
Otherwise, they'd be watching programs that *T*-1 are no different in quality from what they currently view *T*-2 on color TVs.
It would be like "*PRO* watching a black and white movie on a color TV set," says 0 *T*-1 Malcolm G. Saull, chairman of the film and video department at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
The new converters are "a critical link between film and the television domain," says 0 *T*-1 Joerg D. Agin, vice president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division.
Kodak won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market *T*-1, but it's estimated 0 the machine may be available within two years.
A similar machine already on the market, made * by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000 *U*.
And the potential market is tremendous, industry experts say 0 *T*-1.
If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known * in the industry as telecines.
Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations.
"The converter is head and shoulders above anything else 0 I've seen *T*-1," says *T*-2 Richard J. Stumpf, vice president - engineering and development at MCA Inc.'s Universal City Studios.
And Mr. Niles, the program producer, contends that Kodak's move is "a sound marketing decision.
They can't afford *PRO*-1 to stay out of HDTV."
Indeed, the stakes are high.
The U.S. electronics industry estimates that the HDTV market will total about $150 billion *U* over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion *U* expected *-1 to go for related products.
HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines, compared * with 525 for today's televisions, *PRO* providing considerably sharper detail.
And the sets are wider, *PRO*-1 resembling the dimensions of a movie screen.
But the financial rewards aren't expected *-1 soon, nor are they guaranteed.
Experts estimate 0 the first sets of HDTVs won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 *U* each in today's dollars.
Some critics say 0 they won't be quickly embraced *-1 by consumers because of the high price.
Nevertheless, Kodak couldn't risk *PRO*-1 letting HDTV turn its motion - picture film business into a dinosaur.
"Kodak understands 0 HDTV is where everybody is going *T*-2," says *T*-1 RIT's Mr. Spaull.
"Hacksaw" and "Bonecrusher" are the sort of nicknames normally associated * with linebackers and heavyweight contenders.
Who'd *T*-1 have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like that would be school superintendents?
Chicago's new school chief is the hard - nosed Ted Kimbrough.
At his old job in Compton, Calif., he took a bitter teachers' strike and nearly came to blows with a school - board member.
At his first Chicago press conference, he berated the reporters.
In New York City, the new Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, has landed like a 16 - inch shell in the middle of a system that *T*-1 has been impervious to serious reform.
Both men fit the mood of the times--the mood being one of a public fed up with officials' rationalizations for why their schools don't work *T*-1.
Former Patterson, N.J., principal Joe Clark was no doubt the general public's first experience with this new breed of no - nonsense administrator.
*PRO*-1 The subject of the movie "*PRO* Lean on Me," Mr. Clark controlled his school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat.
He may have gone overboard in his pursuit of good discipline, but isn't it *EXP*-1 interesting that some of the country's biggest, most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel - chewing mold?
Elena Scambio, the woman assigned *PRO* to run the Jersey City school system that *T*-1 was taken over *-2 by the state, says 0 her top priority will be *PRO* to "cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy."
Mr. Fernandez doesn't take control in New York until January, but already he's roiling the waters.
He's attacked the concept of "building tenure," one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools.
It means 0 it *EXP*-1 is virtually impossible *PRO* to fire or even transfer incompetent principals.
Once they are in the building, they stay.
One South Bronx principal kept his job for 16 years, despite a serious drinking problem and *PRO* rarely showing up for work.
He was finally given leave when he was arrested *-1 for *PRO*-3 allegedly buying crack *T*-2.
Naturally, the principals' union loves building tenure, and tenure has withstood previous challenge.
We suggest that Mr. Fernandez find an incompetent principal, toss him out of the building and let the forces of the status quo explain to the parents whatever it is *T*-1 0 they're defending *T*-2.
In his old job, as Dade County chief, Mr. Fernandez forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals.
He cut the dropout rate by 5.5%.
But the no - more - nonsense superintendents are going *-2 to have *-3 to be judicious as well; incompetent principals and administrators should go, but the good ones ought *-4 to be left *-1 alone.
The situation will be especially delicate for Mr. Kimbrough.
He takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform.
Chicagoans have just elected 540 neophyte school boards, one for each school.
This of course led to disaster in New York City.
*PRO* Getting a community of parents to care again about its schools is essential, but in Chicago the new boards will make mistakes and Mr. Kimbrough will have *-1 to identify them.
The rise of superintendents such as Joseph Fernandez and Ted Kimbrough suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems.
The schools' central mission, *PRO* educating children, became subsumed *-1 by the competing interests of bureaucrats, politicians and unions.
The classroom itself operated on the periphery of this awful system, discipline collapsed, and kids stopped *-1 learning.
Mr. Chips was a nice fellow, and maybe some day he'll return.
Until then, it *EXP*-2's clear that some of the people who *T*-1've been keeping big - city schools down are going *-3 to be dealing with the Terminator.

Just five months after Ogilvy Group was swallowed up in an unsolicited takeover, Kenneth Roman, Ogilvy's chairman and chief executive officer, said 0 he is leaving *PRO*-1 to take a top post at American Express Co.
Mr. Roman, 59 years old, abruptly announced 0 he will leave the venerable ad agency, whose largest client *T*-1 is American Express, *PRO*-2 to become American Express's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications.
He will succeed Harry L. Freeman, 57, who *T*-1 has said 0 he will retire in December.
Mr. Freeman said in August that he would retire by the end of this year *PRO*-1 to take "executive responsibility" for an embarrassing effort *PRO* to discredit banker Edmond Safra.
American Express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about Mr. Safra.
The company later apologized and agreed *PRO*-1 to make $8 million *U* in contributions to charities chosen * by him.
Although Mr. Freeman is retiring, he will continue *-1 to work as a consultant for American Express on a project basis.
Ad industry executives weren't surprised by Mr. Roman's decision *PRO* to leave Ogilvy.
The agency, under his direction, bitterly fought a takeover attempt by WPP Group PLC of London before *PRO*-1 succumbing in May.
And although Mr. Roman and WPP's chief executive, Martin Sorrell, have gone out of their way *PRO*-1 to be publicly supportive of each other, people close to Mr. Roman say 0 he was unhappy *PRO*-2 giving up control of the company.
Some executives also cite tension because of efforts *ICH*-1 by Mr. Sorrell, a financial man, *PRO* to cut costs at the agency.
Mr. Roman will be succeeded *-1 as the head of Ogilvy's flagship ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, by Graham Phillips, 50, who *T*-2 had been president of North American operations and who *T*-3, like Mr. Sorrell, is British.
Alexander Brody, 56, will take on the newly created position of president of the world - wide agency and chief executive of its international operations.
He had been president of the international operations.
Mr. Roman also had overseen Ogilvy Group's two other units, the Scali McCabe Sloves advertising agency and its research division, but those units will now report directly to WPP.
Mr. Roman appears *-1 custom - made for the American Express job.
*PRO*-1 Known *-2 as a traditional executive, he is very much in the conservative American Express mold.
Moreover, after 26 years at Ogilvy he had honed a reputation for *PRO* being squeaky - clean and a straight arrow--which *T*-1 can only help American Express in the wake of the Safra incident.
He also is close to American Express's chairman and chief executive officer, James D. Robinson III.
Aside from *PRO* working with Mr. Robinson on the American Express advertising account for about 11 years, Mr. Roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as Mr. Robinson.
The abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that Mr. Roman had been pushed *-1 out of Ogilvy's top spot by Mr. Sorrell.
But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation, *PRO*-1 saying 0 Mr. Sorrell had tried several times *PRO*-2 to persuade him *PRO*-3 to stay, *PRO*-2 offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was Seagram's brand, an Ogilvy client).
"He asked me *T*-1 not to resign.
The implication that I was pushed *-1 aside wouldn't be accurate," Mr. Roman said *T*-2.
Mr. Sorrell, *PRO*-2 traveling in the Far East, couldn't be reached *-2.
Mr. Roman said 0 American Express's Mr. Robinson first approached him about the job in late September.
According to industry executives, Peter Sutherland, a former European Community commissioner from Ireland, was also a serious contender for the American Express job.
Although it ultimately wasn't offered *-1 to him, he will be on retainer to American Express as an adviser on international matters.
After *PRO*-2 talking on and off for the past four weeks, Mr. Roman said 0 *?*, he agreed *PRO*-2 to take the job because "it's the right time, it's a terrific opportunity, and I think 0 I leave the company in very strong hands.
It was my decision, not anyone else's."
Mr. Roman also brushed aside reports about infighting between him and Mr. Phillips, his successor at Ogilvy.
The two executives could hardly be more different.
Mr. Roman comes across as a low - key executive; Mr. Phillips has a flashier personality.
During time off, Mr. Roman tends to his garden; Mr. Phillips confesses to a fondness for, among other things, fast cars and planes *ICH*-1.
Industry executives say that although the two executives used *-1 to clash more frequently, the WPP takeover brought them closer together.
"I'm the guy who *T*-1 made him head of New York, head of the U.S., president of North America, and recommended him {to Mr. Sorrell} as my successor.
Would I have done all those things successively if I didn't think 0 he was the right guy?" Mr. Roman asked *T*-1.
He labeled reports of friction *PRO*-1 "ridiculous," and said that he spent part of the weekend on Mr. Phillips's boat in Connecticut.
Mr. Roman will oversee American Express's public relations and government affairs, among other things, but he won't be involved *-1 in its advertising, which *T*-3 is handled *-2 by the operating units.
"I consider this a second career," he said *T*-1.
He also will sit on the company's corporate planning and policy committee, made up of the top corporate and operating executives.
Mr. Roman's departure isn't expected *-1 to have any enormous repercussions at Ogilvy.
American Express, Kraft General Foods, and Mattel executives said 0 the move won't affect their relationships with the ad agency.
"General Foods's relationships with its agencies are based *-1 on the agencies' work, and will continue *-1 to be *?*," said *T*-2 David Hurwitt, a vice president of Kraft General Foods.
But some clients and analysts expressed concern that Mr. Phillips isn't as well - known to many clients.
"Ken was my key contact," said *T*-2 J. Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive officer of Cotton Inc., which *T*-1 represents cotton producers.
"I don't know {Mr. Phillips} all that well.
I haven't seen *RNR*-1 or talked to *RNR*-1 him in several years."
And some analysts questioned whether Mr. Phillips would have the skills 0 Ogilvy needs *T*-1 *PRO* to turn the agency around.
While the agency has done well in many parts of the world, its flagship New York office has had a dismal track record recently; it has won few new accounts while *PRO*-1 losing big ones, including Maxwell House.
"I think 0 {Mr. Phillips} is going *-1 to need some help.
I think 0 they need creative leadership, and I don't think 0 they have it," said *T*-1 Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim & Co.
Ogilvy & Mather's top creative executive, Norman Berry, left the agency earlier this year.
"Norm Berry was a creative inspiration at the company, and nobody has filled that void," said *T*-1 Ms. Hill.
But other analysts said that *PRO* having Mr. Phillips succeed Mr. Roman would make for a smooth transition.
"Graham Phillips has been there a long time, knows the culture well, is aggressive, and apparently gets along well with" Mr. Sorrell, said 0 *T*-1 Andrew Wallach, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert.
"It's probably a reasonable transition.
Hopefully, he'll be the answer to the problems 0 they've had *T*-1 in New York."
Sale of Saatchi Unit Close
Computer Sciences Corp., El Segundo, Calif., said 0 it is close to *PRO* making final an agreement *PRO* to buy Cleveland Consulting Associates from Saatchi & Saatchi
Computer Sciences wouldn't disclose the proposed purchase price for Cleveland Consulting, which *T*-1 counsels companies on logistics and supply.
But David Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, an industry publication based * in Fitzwilliam, N.H., said 0 an industry standard would suggest a purchase price of between one and two times Cleveland Consulting's approximately $15 million *U* annual revenue.
Both Saatchi & Saatchi, which *T*-1 announced its intention *PRO* to sell off most of its consulting business in June, and Cleveland Consulting declined *PRO*-2 to comment on the proposed sale.
Ad Notes....
NEW ACCOUNT:
AmBase Corp., New York, awarded the ad account for its Home Insurance Co. unit to Biederman, Kelly & Shaffer, New York.
Billings weren't disclosed *-1....
Puerto Rico Telephone Co. awarded its $3 million *U* account to West Indies & Grey, Grey Advertising's office in Puerto Rico.
DIET COKE:
Coca - Cola Co. yesterday said 0 singer Elton John signed *PRO*-1 to appear in an ad for Diet Coke.
Details of the commercial, which *T*-1 will be part of the brand's 1990 advertising campaign, weren't disclosed *-2.
Mr. John becomes the latest of many music stars, including George Michael and Whitney Houston, 0 *T*-1 to appear in ads for the diet drink.
Rhone - Poulenc S.A., Paris, said 0 it completed the purchase of the specialty chemicals operation of RTZ Corp., a British mining and industrial group.
Rhone - Poulenc, a chemical and pharmaceutical company, said 0 RTZ Chemicals has annual sales of about $900 million *U*.
It didn't release terms of the transaction.
The dollar weakened in indecisive trading as foreign - exchange dealers awaited fresh economic news that they hope 0 *T*-1 will jolt the U.S. unit out of its narrow ranges.
The Canadian dollar climbed to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since late August, *PRO* prompting the Bank of Canada *PRO*-1 to sell the Canadian currency on the market.
Traders say that after a week of *PRO* nervously tracking every development on Wall Street, the foreign - exchange market has settled back *PRO*-1 to catch its breath ahead of new U.S. economic data.
They noted, however, that a 26 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave the dollar a sharp nudge downward late in the day.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8470 marks, down from 1.8578 marks late Friday, and at 141.90 yen, down from 142.43 yen late Friday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.6030 *U*, up from $1.5885 *U* late Friday.
In Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.80 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.40 yen.
The market's attention is especially focused *-1 on a preliminary report on the U.S. third - quarter gross national product, due out Thursday, which *T*-2 could show 0 the economy is continuing *-3 to expand at a relatively brisk pace.
The consensus view on real GNP, the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted * for inflation, calls for a 2.3% gain on an annual basis, slowing somewhat from the second quarter's 2.5%, but still fairly strong.
Few market participants expect the U.S. unit to rally sharply on the news, if it turns out as *PRO*-1 expected *-2.
Many contend that the report may overstate the economy's health and predict 0 the third - quarter figures may be the last vigorous statistics for some time 0 *T*-1 to come.
"Everyone is waiting for GNP," says *T*-1 Walter Simon, an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer & Co.
"Yet even a relatively strong number--2.8% to 2.9% *U*--won't alter the market's view that the economy is softening."
Hubert Pedroli, managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in New York, adds, "The market sees this as the last piece of good news."
Mr. Pedroli notes that the GNP deflator, a measure of inflation, is expected *-1 to slow, which *T*-2 would give the Federal Reserve more room 0 *PRO* to ease key U.S. rates *T*-3.
Analysts predict a 3.5% rise in the deflator, after *PRO* climbing 4.6% in the second quarter.
They note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in August was reported *-2 earlier this month *T*-4, hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed *-3 and sentiment *ICH*-1 gripped the market that the U.S. economy was losing its momentum.
A 190 - point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view, they say 0 *T*-1.
"Everyone is extremely convinced 0 the economy is slowing," says *T*-1 one senior New York dealer.
"If we're not headed for a recession, we're certainly headed for a major slowdown."
While the market expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders, scheduled * for release today, participants note that the figures will probably serve *PRO*-1 to reinforce this bearish sentiment.
U.S. durable goods orders are expected *-1 to show a decline of 1.2% in September, according to economists.
The anticipated drop follows a 3.9% rise in August.
Traders, however, are quick *PRO*-1 to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for *PRO* buying dollars, the U.S. unit has found a "natural bottom" at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen.
Its resilience around these levels is pegged *-1 to persistent investor demand for the greenback, especially in Japan.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367 *U* an ounce, down 30 cents.
Estimated volume was a very light one million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted *-1 at $366.79 *U* an ounce.
Detrex Corp. said 0 a reserve 0 it is establishing *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to cover expected pollution cleanup costs at an Ohio plant reduced its third - quarter net income by $1.9 million *U*.
Detrex, which *T*-1 has annual sales of about $100 million *U*, declined *PRO*-2 to say if it would post a loss in the third quarter.
The Southfield, Mich. - based company earned $774,000 *U* in the quarter last year.
Detrex is setting aside $3.1 million *U* for the cleanup, but said 0 the reserve reduced its quarterly income by only $1.9 million *U* because of tax considerations.
In addition, the manufacturer said 0 it signed a consent decree with Ohio 0 *PRO* to build a $1.4 million *U* pollution - control facility at the Ashtabula chemical manufacturing plant by Aug. 1, 1990 *T*-1.
Detrex said 0 it is one of at least 17 companies notified * by the Environmental Protection Agency that they may be potentially responsible for *PRO* cleaning up the Fields Brook watershed near Detrex's Ashtabula plant at a total cost 0 the EPA estimates *T*-1 at $48 million *U*--a figure 0 Detrex said 0 the companies dispute *T*-2.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said 0 it will start *-2 enforcing stiffer regulations *ICH*-1 Jan. 31 for so - called gray - market imports of vehicles.
The regulations, required * under legislation enacted * by Congress last year, will apply to imports of vehicles that *T*-1 weren't built *-2 *PRO*-3 to meet U.S. government auto safety standards and were intended for use in Europe or elsewhere abroad.
U.S. officials estimated that gray - market imports total about 2,100 units a year, a small part of the more than three million vehicles exported * to the U.S. each year.
According to the NHTSA, the new regulations will prohibit anyone other than an importer that *T*-1 has registered with the U.S. government, or a person who *T*-2 has a contract with a registered importer, from *PRO*-4 permanently importing a vehicle that *T*-3 doesn't meet the U.S. auto safety standards.
The registered importer would be required *-1 *PRO*-4 to bring such vehicles into compliance with the U.S. safety standards, compared with the current situation in which anyone can bring in such vehicles and modify them *PRO*-3 to meet the U.S. standards *T*-2.
Congress tightened auto safety standards for gray - market imports after U.S. auto dealers, including franchised foreign - car dealers, complained that they often were blamed *-1 when the second and third buyers of such vehicles found that the cars couldn't meet U.S. auto safety standards *T*-2.
At a private dinner Thursday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief executive Frederick Joseph delivered a sobering message about the junk bond market to officials of Prudential Insurance Co. of America.
Mr. Joseph conceded 0 the junk market was in disarray, according to people familiar with the discussion.
He said 0 Drexel--the leading underwriter of high - risk junk bonds--could no longer afford *PRO*-1 to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked *PRO*-2 losing its highly lucrative junk franchise.
The dinner was a stark confirmation that 1989 is the worst year ever for the $200 billion *U* junk market.
And investors and traders alike say 0 the current turmoil could take years *PRO*-1 to resolve.
Amid the market disorder, even Drexel, which *T*-1 has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns.
Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, Drexel has been unable *PRO*-1 to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once - devoted investors.
For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating.
"This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over," says *T*-1 Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., a credit rating company.
In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds--those with less than an investment - grade rating--*ICH*-1 showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market 0 *T*-2 to do so.
Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed *-1 by all categories of investment - grade bonds, including ultra-safe Treasury securities.
The junk market, which *T*-1 mushroomed to $200 billion *U* from less than $2 billion *U* at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments.
The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which *T*-1 created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $3 billion *U* in junk financing.
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that *T*-1 caused it to be tardy on some interest payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale.
At that point, the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried *PRO*-1 to sell.
In an interview, Mr. Joseph says 0 his dinner discussion with the Prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk.
"What I thought 0 I was saying *T*-2 is that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality - conscious, which *T*-1 is not at all bad," he says *T*-3.
"Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years, and we're going *-1 to make sure 0 our default rates are going *-2 to be in the acceptable parameters of the market."
What *T*-2 has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold *-1 with the ease of common stocks and many investment - grade bonds.
Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers are quickly matched *-3 *T*-2, the junk market, where risky corporate loans are traded *-1 *T*-4, is sometimes closed *-5 for repairs.
At closely held Deltec Securities Corp., junk bond money managers Amy K. Minella and Hannah H. Strasser say 0 the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.
In recent months, they say 0 *?*, there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors, while new buyers *ICH*-2 haven't materialized 0 *T*-3 to replace them.
Wall Street securities firms, "the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market," have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses, Deltec said 0 *T*-1 in a recent, grim report to customers.
Mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced "above - normal" redemptions by shareholders, Deltec said 0 *T*-1.
Investors, *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-1 to raise cash, have sold "large liquid issues" such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co.; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress.
And, Deltec said 0 *?*, buying has been severely reduced *-1 because savings and loans have been restricted *-2 in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation.
"In fact, savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter," Deltec said *T*-1.
Ms. Minella and Ms. Strasser say 0 they are managing their junk portfolios defensively, *PRO*-1 building cash and selectively upgrading the overall quality.
Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion *U* from $7 billion *U* since August because of falling junk prices.
"We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something 0 *PRO* to be concerned about *T*-3," says *T*-2 James A. Gregoire, a managing director.
"I have no reason 0 *PRO* to think 0 things will get worse *T*-1, but this market has a knack for *PRO*-2 surprising us.
This market teaches us *PRO*-1 to be humble."
The junk market's "yield hogs are learning a real painful lesson," he says 0 *T*-1.
Although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default, the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble, says 0 *T*-1 Stuart Reese, manager of Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s $17 billion *U* investment - grade public bond portfolio.
"But we think 0 the risks *ICH*-1 are there for things getting a lot worse.
And the risks aren't appropriate for us," he says *T*-1.
The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million *U* of publicly sold junk bonds.
The string of big junk bond defaults, which *T*-1 have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say 0 *T*-2.
"If anything, we're going *-1 to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined," says *T*-2 Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
Mr. Asquith, whose study on junk bond defaults *T*-2 caused a furor on Wall Street when it was disclosed *-1 last April *T*-3, says 0 this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings.
His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%.
One indication of a growing number of junk defaults, Mr. Asquith says 0 *?*, is that about half of the $3 billion *U* of corporate bonds outstanding that *T*-2 have been lowered *-1 to a default rating by S&P this year are junk bonds sold * during the market's big issue years of 1984 through 1986.
These bonds, now rated * *PRO*-1 single - D, include junk offerings by AP Industries, Columbia Savings (Colorado), First Texas Savings Association, Gilbraltar Financial Corp., Integrated Resources Inc., Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp., Resorts International Inc., Southmark Corp. and Vyquest Inc.
"Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who *T*-1 told us 0 the market wasn't so risky," says *T*-2 Bradford Cornell, professor of finance at University of California's Anderson Graduate School of Management in Los Angeles.
Mr. Cornell has just completed a study that *T*-1 finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment - grade bonds.
Mr. Cornell says: "The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed 0 *?*, but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say 0 *?*."
Despite the junk market's problems, Drexel continues *-2 to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its Wall Street rivals haven't found *T*-1.
During the past three weeks, for example, Drexel has sold $1.3 billion *U* of new junk bonds for Turner Broadcasting Co., Uniroyal Chemical, Continental Air and Duff & Phelps.
Still, the list of troubled Drexel bond offerings dwarfs that of any firm on Wall Street, as does its successful offerings.
Troubled Drexel - underwritten issues include Resorts International, Braniff, Integrated Resources, SCI TV, Gillette Holdings, Western Electric and Southmark.
"Quality junk bonds will continue *-1 to trade well," says *T*-2 Michael Holland, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc.
"But the deals that *T*-1 never should have been brought *-2 have now become nuclear waste.
When last we left him *T*-1, FBI Agent Nick Mancuso had solved a murder mystery, unraveled a Washington political scandal, and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the miniseries "Favorite Son."
What next for the crusty FBI agent with the heart of gold?
A spinoff series, of course.
There are plenty of worse inspirations for shows--and most of them had already made the fall lineup:
a nun raising some lovable orphans.
A den mother raising some lovable teen models.
A bunch of tans and bathing suits posing as lovable lifeguards.
In that context, Robert Loggia's riveting performance as the unlovable--even crotchety--veteran agent seems *-1 a better franchise for a series than most.
Week by week on "Mancuso FBI" (NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m . ET), he *ICH*-1 pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene--a loose cannon on deck at the FBI.
Over the first few weeks, "Mancuso FBI" has sprung straight from the headlines, which *T*-1 is either a commendable stab at topicality, or a lack of imagination, or both.
The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused * of *PRO*-1 womanizing (a la John Tower).
When his secretary is found *-1 *PRO*-3 floating *PRO*-6 dead in the pol's pool *T*-2, Mancuso is called *-4 in *PRO*-5 to investigate.
Last week, a young black girl claimed 0 she had been raped *-1 by a white police officer (a la Tawana Brawley).
In this week's show, there's an unsafe nuclear weaponsmaking facility (a la Rocky Flats).
Along the way, we're introduced *-2 to the supporting cast: a blond bombshell secretary (Randi Brazen--her real name, honest), a scheming young boss (Fredric Lehne), another blonde bombshell who *T*-1's also an idealistic lawyer (Lindsay Frost), and a forensics expert (Charles Siebert).
If all of this seems *-2 a little stale, it's redeemed *-1 in part by some tricky plot twists:
The usual suspects are found *-1 to be guilty, then not guilty, then guilty--but of a different crime.
(In last week's rape case, for example, the girl turns out *-2 to have been a victim of incest, and the biggest villains are the politicians who *T*-1 exploit the case.)
Most of all though, the show is redeemed *-1 by the character of Mancuso.
What *T*-2 makes the veteran FBI man so endearing is his hard - bitten cynicism--earned *, we discover *?*, when he was assigned *-1 to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s *T*-3.
He wasn't protecting the Freedom Marchers; he was tailing them as subversives.
This is not the "Mississippi Burning" scenario that *T*-1 thrills his young colleagues: "Kid, you've been reading Classic Comics too long," Mancuso says *T*-2.
"Back in 1964, the FBI had five black agents.
Three were chauffeurs for J. Edgar Hoover, and two cleaned his house."
At the core of Mr. Loggia's Mancuso is *T*-1 his world - weary truculence.
He describes a reporter as "Miss First Amendment."
He describes a drowned corpse as "Esther Williams."
And when he's told "*PRO* Try a little tenderness *T*-1," he shoots back "I'm going home *PRO*-2 to try a little linguine."
Yet for all his cynicism, he's at heart a closet idealist, a softy with a secret crush on truth, justice and the American Way.
He's the kind of guy who *T*-1 rescues trampled flags.
If "Mancuso FBI" has an intriguing central character, it also has a major flaw:
It's wildly overwritten.
Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner (and writer / producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello) have revved this show up to the breaking point.
*PRO* To start, there's always a crisis--and someone always worries, "What if the press gets a hold of this?"
At least once an episode we see protestors marching around *PRO*-1 screaming slogans.
At least once Mancuso's boss yells "In here--now," and proceeds *PRO*-1 to dress his investigator down:
"You are a dinosaur...a hangover in a $10 *U* suit ...
One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister."
Finally, of course, the boss gives in, but he's still yelling: "I find myself explaining anything to Teddy Kennedy, you'll be chasing stolen cars in Anchorage."
In fact, throughout "Mancuso FBI," we don't get words or lines--we get speeches.
Witnesses shout, scream, pontificate: "...a dream that the planet could be saved *-1 from itself and from the sadistic dumb creatures who *T*-2 try *PRO*-4 to tear down every decent man who *T*-3 raises his voice."
And Mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his lungs: "How the hell can you live with yourself *T*-1?" he erupts *T*-2 at a politician.
"You twist people's trust.
You built your career on prejudice and hate.
The scars will be here years after the polls close."
In each show, Mancuso gets *PRO*-1 to unleash similar harangues:
"Where the hell are they gon *-2 na live *T*-3 when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump *T*-4?
You're the real criminal here...and what you did *T*-1 wasn't just a murder--it was a crime against humanity."
And, at least once a show, someone delivers the line "*PRO* Get off that soapbox."
Now that's advice 0 the writers should take *T*-1 to heart.
They have a series with a good character, some interesting, even occasionally surprising plot lines, and they're ruining it.
Why, when a key witness disappears *T*-1, does Mancuso trash her apartment *T*-2, *PRO*-3 tearing down drapes, smashing walls?
It's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction, *PRO* all to add more pizzazz to a script that *T*-1's already overdosing on pizzazz.
That's not plot.
That's not character.
That's hyperventilating.
There is a scene at the end of the first week's show where Mancuso attends the unveiling of the memorial to his dead partner David *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to say a few words, he pulls out his crumpled piece of paper and tries *PRO*-1 to talk, but he's too choked up 0 *T*-4 to get the words out.
He bangs on the piece of paper in frustration, then turns and walks away.
It was a profoundly moving moment for series television, and Robert Loggia's acting resonated in the silence.
There's a pretty good program inside all the noise of "Mancuso FBI."
If the show's creators could just let themselves be quiet for a little, they might just hear it.
In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.
David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake *PRO*-2 to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that *T*-1 might result in his assassination.
With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought *-1 to know.
What *T*-1 went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.
Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein 0 *PRO* to blame the executive branch *T*-1 while *PRO*-2 stamping "top secret" on their own complicity.
But there's no danger of *PRO* exposing sources and methods in *PRO* disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue.
And if Congress is going *-1 to assume authority *PRO* to micromanage foreign policy, it's going *-2 to have *-3 to take some of the responsibility too.
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces *PRO*-1 to move against Mr. Noriega.
When they did *?* *T*-1, his commanders didn't have the initiative 0 *PRO* to do more than *PRO*-3 block a couple of roads *T*-2.
The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity.
But what kind of initiative can you expect *T*-1 given the climate set * by Congress?
For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters *T*-1 about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?
What part did U.S. warnings play *T*-1 in the major's unwillingness *PRO* to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops *T*-2?
Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol.
Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right *PRO* to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you.
Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: *PRO* Confiding in the United States may be fatal.
CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started *-2 last week by *PRO*-1 noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.
The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried *PRO*-1 to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point.
"The interpretation" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said 0 *?*, "and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it *T*-1, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me."
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA.
The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter.
And of course, *PRO* doing anything that *T*-2 might be second - guessed *-1 by Congress carries heavy penalties.
*PRO* Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North.
The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell *PRO*-1 to write a best seller about Iran - Contra, deploring "Men of Zeal."
No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it.
What kind of initiative should anyone expect *T*-3 from people out on the line who *T*-1've read all this and know what *T*-2 can happen if they fail?
Who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play?
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind - set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by *PRO*-1 rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability *PRO* to defend America's national security.
There are of course good reasons 0 the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business *T*-1, but *PRO* rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as *PRO* saying 0 the U.S. should start *-2 passing out exploding cigars.
The world being the nasty place 0 it is *T*-1, we want Presidents to have the freedom 0 *PRO* to order operations in which someone might get killed *-4 *T*-3 *T*-2.
In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, you can only make sure 0 the President takes the responsibility.
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.
As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.
It can send a fighter squadron *PRO*-1 to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal.
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way 0 the U.S. will kill a madman *T*-1 is by *PRO* making sure 0 we take some innocent civilians with him.
LDI Corp., Cleveland, said 0 it will offer $50 million *U* in commercial paper backed * by lease - rental receivables.
The program matches funds raised * from the sale of the commercial paper with small to medium - sized leases.
LDI termed the paper *PRO*-3 "non-recourse financing," *PRO*-2 meaning that investors would be repaid *-1 from the lease receivables, rather than directly by LDI Corp.
LDI leases and sells data - processing, telecommunications and other high - tech equipment.
China could exhaust its foreign - exchange reserves as early as next year, a Western government report says 0 *?*, unless imports are cut *-1 drastically *PRO* to help narrow the balance - of - payments deficit.
According to the report, completed * last month, if China's trade gap continues *-1 to widen at the pace seen * in the first seven months of this year, the reserves would be wiped out *-2 either in 1990 or 1991.
A country is considered *-1 financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports.
The $14 billion *U* of reserves 0 China had *T*-1 in June would cover just that much.
The report by the Western government, which *T*-2 declines *PRO*-2 to be identified *-1, concludes that "a near - term foreign - exchange payment problem can be avoided *-3 only if import growth drops to below 5% per annum."
According to Chinese customs figures, import growth has slowed in recent months, *PRO*-1 dropping to 16% in July and 7.1% in August from the year - earlier periods, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.
But before import growth slowed, China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign - exchange reserves.
The $14 billion *U* level in June marked a drop from $19 billion *U* at the end of April.
China's last big import binge sent reserves *PRO*-1 tumbling to $10.6 billion *U* in June 1985 from $16.6 billion *U* the previous September.
China might stave off a crisis if it acts as forcefully as it did *PRO*-1 to arrest the 1985 decline, when Beijing slammed the brakes on foreign - exchange spending and devalued the currency *T*-2.
But this time, China faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that *T*-1 have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings June 4.
For example, China's hard - currency income is expected *-1 to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4.
Revenue from tourism this year is projected *-1 to total $1.3 billion *U*, down from $2.2 billion *U* last year.
Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, which *T*-1 measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, is expected *-2 to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion *U* deficit last year.
The Western government report suggests a number of scenarios for China's current - account balance, two of which *T*-2 are considered *-1 most likely.
In one, imports and exports continue *-1 to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% recorded * during the first seven months, and the current - account deficit widens to $13.1 billion *U*.
In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion *U*.
The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions *PRO* to curb imports in the coming months.
In this case, China would still finish the year with a current - account deficit of $8.7 billion *U*, based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%.
If China were still on good terms with foreign lenders, it might be able *PRO*-1 to stem the drain on its foreign - exchange reserves by *PRO*-2 using some loan funds *PRO*-3 to offset the current - account deficit.
But since June, foreign bankers led * by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China.
Even if borrowing resumes, commercial bankers aren't expected *-1 to lend as much as before.
In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment.
On top of all this, foreign - debt repayments are expected *-1 to peak in 1991 to 1992.
With less capital coming in, China's balance of payments would suffer.
The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment.
In the second, foreign borrowing is projected *PRO*-1 to grow 10% and investment *PRO*-2 to drop 10%.
But in either case, the report says 0 *?*, China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves, which *T*-1 are used *-3 *PRO* to finance the imbalance.
In the first scenario, the reserves would be exhausted *-1 next year, and in the second they would be wiped out *-2 in 1991.
A federal judge granted a temporary stay of the California Student Aid Commission's emergency action *PRO* to stop *-1 guaranteeing loans for National Technical Schools, a unit of United Education & Software Inc.
The California Student Aid Commission took the action Oct. 15 after a government audit cited National Technical Schools for *PRO*-1 having courses too short 0 *T*-2 to be eligible for the educational loan program and having a student drop - out rate far in excess of federal standards, and it alleged other serious violations of law and regulations.
United Education & Software, a Los Angeles education services company, called the commission's action *PRO*-1 "precipitous and unwarranted."
The court set a hearing on the emergency action for Oct. 30.
United Education & Software posted a $250,000 *U* bond against potential losses to the student aid commission and to taxpayers in *PRO* guaranteeing any more loans for National Technical Schools students prior to the hearing.
GAF, Part III is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to begin today.
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.
The first two GAF trials were watched *-1 closely on Wall Street because they were considered *-2 to be important tests of the government's ability *PRO* to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider - trading investigations.
In an eight - count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with *PRO*-1 illegally attempting *PRO*-2 to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock *PPA*-3 in 1986.
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who *T*-1 was implicated *-2 by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.
The GAF trials were viewed *-1 as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian.
Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected *-1 to affect his sentencing.
But GAF's bellwether role was short - lived.
The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document *T*-1.
After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said 0 they were hopelessly deadlocked, and another mistrial was declared *-1 on March 22.
Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June.
A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared *-1 a jail term by a federal judge who *T*-2 praised him for *PRO*-3 helping the government.
In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts.
Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players directly involved * in the GAF case.
The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo.
For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 *U* fine on each count.
GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 *U* for each count.
Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort *PRO* to prevent a trial, but by the end of the month the talks had ended.
There is much speculation *ICH*-1 among attorneys not involved * that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman.
Neither testified at the previous trials.
For now, defense attorneys are tight - lipped about their plans.
Max Gitter, another GAF defense attorney, said yesterday, "As we go in for the third time, Yogi Berra's famous line *ICH*-1 is apt: ` It's deja vu all over again."'
DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope *PRO*-1 to stop reorganization - plan appeal.
Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who *T*-1 claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court *PRO*-3 to refuse *PRO*-4 to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy - law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co., which *T*-2 manufactured the device.
The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other.
Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay *RNR*-2--and perhaps even destroy *RNR*-2--a $2.38 billion *U* settlement fund that *T*-1 is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan.
The bankruptcy - court reorganization is being challenged *-1 before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available *PRO* to settle claims.
It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co.
The latter provision is "legally unprecedented," said 0 *T*-2 Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C., who *T*-1 is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants.
More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending.
The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries.
Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for *PRO* paying its debts.
American Home Products Corp. wants *PRO*-2 to acquire Robins, but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted *-1.
In a brief filed * with the Supreme Court last week, Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for *PRO*-1 raising "abstract" and "theoretical" legal issues, while *PRO*-2 jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants.
The Supreme Court is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6.
JURY'S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first.
Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found *-1 guilty of *PRO*-2 violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act.
Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare, and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case.
Under Superfund, those who *T*-1 owned, generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup, regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time.
Environmental lawyers say 0 virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed *PRO* to insure cleanup of past polluting activities.
But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment.
In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by *PRO*-1 making it a felony.
Mr. Donohoo was convicted *-1 in Louisville late last month of *PRO*-3 violating Superfund by *PRO*-4 failing *-5 to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building 0 he was demolishing *T*-2.
He was also convicted *-1 of *PRO*-2 failing *-3 to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act.
The government sought a criminal penalty because "no cleanup is possible here.
Once {asbestos} is released *-1 into the environment, it can lodge anywhere," says *T*-3 Richard A. Dennis, the assistant U.S. attorney who *T*-2 prosecuted the case.
Mr. Donohoo is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to be sentenced *-1 Dec. 11.
His lawyer could not be reached *-1 for comment.
Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 *U* fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 *U* fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act.
TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims' side in death - sentence case.
Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, the Washington, D.C., law firm that *T*-1 spent over $1 million *U* *PRO*-3 fighting the execution of mass - murderer Ted Bundy--who *T*-2 eventually was executed *-4--has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas.
The law firm has filed a friend - of - the - court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.
The key issue in the case, which the law firm is handling *T*-1 without a fee, or pro bono, is whether a person sentenced * to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review.
The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted *-1 of *PRO*-2 killing 14 people.
Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons's death sentence in a "next friend" capacity.
Wilmer Cutler's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who *T*-1 filed the appeal lacks proper standing.
P.J. Mode, Wilmer Cutler's managing partner, says 0 the trial team that *T*-3 represented Mr. Bundy was asked *-1 by the firm's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised *-2.
The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also, because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out * for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for *PRO*-1 displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work.
"We give them a lot of credit for *PRO*-2 taking this case," says *T*-1 WLF's Alan Slobodin.
THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS:
In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs.
James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now - defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged *-1 with *PRO*-2 conducting high - pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited - edition lithographs *T*-3.
The posters were sold *-1 for $1,300 to $6,000 *U*, although the government says 0 they had a value of only $53 to $200 *U* apiece.
Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said 0 about 1,000 customers were defrauded *-1 and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million *U*.
Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to *PRO*-3 making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized *-1 by Mr. Dali, who *T*-2 died in January.
The posters were printed *-1 on paper pre-signed * by Mr. Dali, the attorneys said 0 *T*-2.
Part of a Series}
SMYRNA, Ga. --
The auto - dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway, *PRO*-2 stretching from the Perimeter highway that *T*-1 circles Atlanta to the "Big Chicken," a pullet - roofed fast - food restaurant and local landmark.
Twenty years ago, in the infancy of suburban sprawl, just a handful of dealerships were here.
Now there are 23.
Alongside such long - familiar names as Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge are *T*-2 nameplates that *T*-1 didn't exist until three years ago: Acura, Sterling, Hyundai.
Under construction is *T*-1 the strip's 24th showroom, the future home of Lexus, a luxury marque launched * by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago.
The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America, in everything from phone companies to colas.
And especially, as the Cobb Parkway strip attests, in cars.
Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars, vans and trucks, up from just 408 when the decade began *T*-1, according to Automotive News, a trade publication.
For car marketers, it has become a much tougher battle *PRO* to keep loyal customers from *PRO*-1 defecting to one of the new makes on the block.
For American car buyers, the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing.
Malcolm MacDougall, vice chairman of the Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York, calls the proliferation *PRO*-1 "nameplate mania."
He says 0 the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today, and that people will simply ignore new models that *T*-1 lack a well - defined image.
"The winners," he predicts *?*, "will be brands from car makers that *T*-2 have traditionally been associated *-1 with quality and value."
He says 0 it *EXP*-1's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while *PRO*-2 still retaining links to the parent company's quality image.
He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co. for *PRO*-1 creating separate divisions for their new luxury models, rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines.
Some auto executives believe 0 the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks.
"There's more noise out there, and the consumer may have *-2 to work harder *PRO*-3 to cut through it," says *T*-1 Vincent P. Barabba, executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp.
"But the reward is that there's less need *PRO* to make tradeoffs" in *PRO*-1 choosing one's wheels.
Jeanene Page, of North Salt Lake City, Utah, likes the broader selection.
She wants something big, and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car.
Now, the 55 - year - old car shopper is zeroing in on a full - sized van, *PRO*-1 figuring that it's just the thing 0 *T*-2 to haul nine grandchildren and pull a boat at the same time.
"That seems *-2 to be what all my friends are using *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to take the grandkids to the lake," she says *T*-4.
Market segmentation in cars isn't new, but it's far more extensive than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago *T*-1.
The legendary GM chairman declared that his company would make "a car for every purse and purpose."
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose.
Just four years ago, GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments.
Today, they identify 19 distinct segments for cars, and another 11 for trucks and vans.
The number of makes has mushroomed because the U.S. is the world's biggest and richest market for automobiles; virtually every auto maker wants *PRO*-1 to sell here.
For every brand like Renault or Fiat that *T*-1 has been squeezed out *-2, others such as Isuzu, Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in.
Detroit tries *PRO*-1 to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own.
GM launched the Geo marque *ICH*-2 this year 0 *T*-1 to sell cars made * in partnership with foreign auto makers, and next year GM's long - awaited Saturn cars will make their debut.
Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate *ICH*-2 in 1985 0 *T*-1 to sell its German - made touring sedans in the U.S. .
But slow sales forced Ford *PRO*-1 to kill the brand just last week.
When consumers have so many choices *T*-1, brand loyalty is much harder 0 *PRO* to maintain *T*-2.
The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey found that 53% of today's car buyers tend *-1 to switch brands.
For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits.
Which cars do Americans favor *T*-1 most these days?
It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to generalize, but age seems *-2 to be the best predictor.
Adults under age 30 like sports cars, luxury cars, convertibles and imports far more than their elders do.
Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer *PRO*-1 to buy a sports car, compared with just 16% of adults 30 and over, according to the Journal survey.
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37% to 28% *U* margin--even though older buyers, because of their incomes, are more likely *-1 to actually purchase a luxury car.
Perhaps most striking, 35% of households headed * by people aged 18 to 44 have at least one foreign car.
That's true of only 14% of households headed * by someone 60 or older.
Generally, imports appeal most to Americans who *T*-1 live in the West and are well - educated, affluent and, especially, young.
"For many baby boomers, *PRO* buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience," says *T*-1 Christopher Cedergren, auto - market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills, Calif.
Such preferences persist even though many Americans believe 0 differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing.
Only 58% of Americans now believe that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models, the Journal survey found, down from 68% in 1987.
Some 46% give foreign cars higher quality ratings, down from 50% two years ago.
On the other hand, only 42% say 0 foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models, down from 55% in 1987.
People in the automotive business disagree over how susceptible younger Americans are *T*-1 to brand switching.
"Once buying habits are formed *-1, they're very hard 0 *PRO* to break *T*-3," declares *T*-2 Thomas Mignanelli, executive vice president for Nissan's U.S. sales operations.
But out on Cobb Parkway, Ted Negas sees it differently.
"The competition is so intense that an owner's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent," says *T*-1 Mr. Negas, vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile, one of the first dealerships 0 *T*-2 to locate on the strip.
Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it *EXP*-1 possible *PRO* to win them back, just as it *EXP*-2 was possible *PRO* to lose them.
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip.
Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners whose cars *T*-1 are less than a year old, so they get quicker service.
Just down the street, Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers *PRO*-1 to test - drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip, and compare the cars side - by - side.
Manufacturers, too, are stretching further *PRO*-1 to lure buyers.
GM's Cadillac division, *PRO*-1 ignoring Detroit's long - held maxim that safety doesn't sell, is airing television commercials touting its cars' safety features.
Cadillac may be on to something.
Some 60% of the survey respondents said 0 they would buy anti-lock brakes even if they carry a medium or high price tag.
More than 50% felt the same way about air bags.
Both features appealed most to buyers under 45.
In contrast, dashboard computers, power seats and turbo - charged engines had little appeal.
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days.
GM's Pontiac division is offering a turbo - charged V - 6 engine on its Grand Prix model, even though it expects *PRO*-1 to sell only about 4,000 cars equipped * with that option.
The reason: Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today's.
Americans spent more than $190 billion *U* on new cars and trucks last year, and just 1% of that market exceeded Polaroid Co.'s sales of $1.86 billion *U*.
"Even if it's only 1%," says *?* GM's Mr. Barabba, "would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid?"
Consumer spending in Britain rose 0.1% in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8% from a year ago, the Central Statistical Office estimated 0 *T*-1 Friday.
The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines and clarified others in a move that *T*-1 could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white - collar defendants.
The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid *PRO*-1 disrupting "the normal business functions" of companies charged * under the racketeering law, a senior department official said 0 *T*-2.
Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors "*PRO*-3 not to take steps that *T*-1 would harm innocent third parties" in a case brought * under the racketeering law, the official, David Runkel, said 0 *T*-2.
The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of *PRO* updating prosecutorial guidelines, Mr. Runkel said 0 *T*-1.
The changes apply to prosecutions brought * under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
Under that law, defendants who *T*-1 allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a "criminal enterprise" may be charged *-2 with racketeering and forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise.
The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers.
They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named * in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged *-1.
The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive *ICH*-1 to prosecutors that they should seek *PRO*-2 to seize assets from defendants "in proportion" to the nature of the alleged offense, Mr. Runkel said 0 *T*-3.
"That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt *PRO*-1 to seize the whole business; you attempt *PRO*-2 to seize assets related * to the crime," he explained *T*-3.
In general, the thrust of the department's directive is *PRO* to encourage prosecutors *PRO*-4 to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of *PRO* protecting assets 0 the government may subsequently be able *PRO*-3 to seize *T*-2 after a conviction, Mr. Runkel said 0 *T*-1.
Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.
But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling - party members.
And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society.
Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee *PRO*-1 to plan a special two - day investigation at the end of the month.
But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling - party members are divided *-1 between those who *T*-2 want *PRO*-4 to pursue the matter in hope of *PRO* undermining the opposition and those who *T*-3 favor *PRO*-5 leaving well enough alone.
"The opposition can be the most hurt *-1 because everyone already figures 0 the LDP is that kind of beast," says *T*-2 Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst.
But, he adds, "We can't tell where it will go *T*-1 at all because we're still in the middle of it."
This time, the scandal centers on donations made * by the not - quite - mainstream pachinko parlor industry.
Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.
The donations so far appear *-3 to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that *T*-1 changed hands in the Recruit Co . influence - peddling scandal that *T*-2 plagued the ruling party last year.
But the implications could be great.
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked *-1 to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.
Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made *-1 with the intent *PRO* to bribe.
Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners *ICH*-1 are Korean, many of whom *T*-2 maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan.
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory.
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.
Devotees pass hours, *PRO*-1 watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, *PRO*-1 as much *ICH*-3 to gamble as to get a little time 0 *PRO* to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts *T*-2.
At 500 yen ($3.60 *U*) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been *?* since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.
But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion *U*), or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.
And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate 0 the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen.
If that money were being taxed *-1, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen.
In 1984, an attempt *ICH*-2 was made *-1 *PRO* to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions.
Then, in 1988, a proposal *PRO* to keep better track of income by *PRO* selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded *-1 in parliament.
The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral.
In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.
The magazine alleged that in *PRO* making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes 0 *T*-1 to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren.
The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.
And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted *PRO*-1 to pursue the issue.
But the press kept it *PRO*-4 alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists *ICH*-3 began *-2 circulating with names of people who *T*-1 had received money.
Within a matter of weeks, less - conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.
So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions 0 the LDP members received *T*-1 amounted to bribes.
Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered *-1 by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members.
The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with *PRO*-1 receiving 125 million yen ($880,000 *U*) and other opposition parties with *PRO*-3 taking about 2.5 million yen.
On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175 *U*) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal.
Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined *-1 as foreign, but both groups deny *PRO*-2 making direct donations.
They say 0 it s possible 0 some of their members may be donating privately.
The issue is further complicated *-1 because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised *-2 in Japan and many speak only Japanese.
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history--their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II *T*-2--and the discrimination that *T*-1 still faces Koreans in Japanese society.
Many Japanese think it *EXP*-2 only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way 0 many Japanese do *T*-1, *PRO*-3 to win favor or support.
Both residents' organizations admit to *PRO*-1 receiving some funding from abroad.
But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend *-1 to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, *PRO*-2 implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally.
When Robert McDuffie was 14 *T*-1, he got a chance *PRO* to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in Macon, Ga.
Unfortunately, his mother had tickets for a recital by Itzhak Perlman the same night, and she was adamant about his attending.
"I threw such a fit," says *T*-2 Mr. McDuffie, who *T*-1 had begun violin studies at the age of six.
"But once Perlman started *-1 playing, I didn't give a damn about basketball....
Afterwards, I went home and practiced for three hours."
Today, it *EXP*-1's obvious that the brawny, six - foot, one - inch musician made the right choice.
At 31, Mr. McDuffie has a rich, full - bodied tone, an admirable rhythmic precision and an increasingly busy schedule.
He's currently in the midst of a 17 - city U.S. tour with Yehudi Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia, with stops including Charleston, S.C . (Oct. 25), Sarasota, Fla . (Oct. 28), Tampa, Fla . (Oct. 29) and Miami (Oct. 31).
Later this season he gives a recital at Washington's Kennedy Center, and appears as soloist with several major orchestras.
Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries.
During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack"--a group of budding virtuosos who *T*-1 studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay.
His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who *T*-1 performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho - Liang Lin, who *T*-2 joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno - Sonnenberg, who *T*-3 launched her career by *PRO*-4 winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition.
"I thought 0 I was over the hill at 22," recalls *T*-1 Mr. McDuffie, an outgoing man with pale blue eyes and a light Southern drawl.
"But I wasn't ready for a career at that time."
Young McDuffie's first violin teacher was Henrik Schwarzenberger, a Hungarian refugee who *T*-1 taught in the Macon public school system.
"He taught me how *PRO* to play like a gypsy *T*-1," jokes *T*-2 the musician.
"I didn't learn *PRO*-1 to count until I got to Juilliard."
After studies at that conservatory's Pre-College Division with an assistant to the legendary instructor Ivan Galamian, he switched at the college level to Miss DeLay, Mr. Galamian's longtime assistant and, ultimately, his rival.
"I think 0 I had *-2 to prove myself to her," says *T*-1 Mr. McDuffie.
"But she was always encouraging.
She only put her foot down twice," he continues *T*-1.
"In my freshman year, my roommate was known *-1 as a party animal.
She thought 0 I wasn't getting my practicing done."
As the violinist tells it, his grandmotherly looking teacher "put her hands on her hips, stomped her foot and said, ` You've just got *-1 to get the {expletive deleted *-2} out of there."'
The second incident took place after Mr. McDuffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself.
Miss DeLay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital.
"We listened to the Chausson ` Poeme,"' he recalls *?*, "and she said, ` You hear the first note, that B - flat?
That's the only note that *T*-1's truly in tune ...'."
"That's the most important experience 0 I've had *T*-1 with any teacher," he says *?*, "because she taught me how *PRO* to listen *T*-3.
Now, when I play with orchestras *T*-1, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation."
It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th - century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber *T*-1.
After *PRO*-2 winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's "Violin Concerto," Mr. McDuffie was invited *-2 *PRO*-3 to play the work for the composer, who *T*-1 was dying of cancer.
"Barber was seated *-2 by the fireplace *PRO*-2 looking very pale," recalls *T*-3 the violinist, who *T*-1 performed the work with a piano accompanist at the composer's apartment.
"He didn't say much, but what he said *T*-1 was important because it's not in the score.
There's a beautiful, Coplandesque motif--he'd kill me if he heard me say that--throughout the first movement ...
The only time 0 the violin has it *T*-1 is right at the end.
It's written *-1 ` marcato' in the score, and I played it that way, kind of gigue - like.
And he yelled out ` dolce! dolce!' {` sweet! sweet!'}."
"So we did it over," he adds *T*-1.
"I played very transparently, with the tip of the bow.
If a conductor is sensitive enough 0 *T*-1 to bring down the orchestra {volume} at that point, it makes the piece magical.
I don't know why Barber never told anybody else *T*-1.
On Isaac Stern's recording it's very biting."
Since *PRO*-1 leaving Juilliard, Mr. McDuffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones.
His guest appearance on the NBC soap opera "Another World," scandalized musical elitists.
By contrast, he's won kudos for his espousal of William Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which he recently recorded *T*-1 for Angel / EMI along with Leonard Bernstein's engaging "Serenade for Violin Solo, Strings and Percussion."
Mr. McDuffie's sweet tone, heartfelt lyricism and rhythmic punch make him an ideal interpreter of both works.
*PRO*-2 Aided *-1 by the fluid playing of the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin's direction, this "Serenade" really swings.
Mr. Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which *T*-1 sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive "Agitato, fervente."
But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani.
At Avery Fisher Hall here, Mr. McDuffie was heard *-1 recently with Mr. Menuhin and the Warsaw Sinfonia in more conventional fare--Bruch's overwrought "Violin Concerto in G Minor."
His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed.
The 35 - member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that *T*-1 belied its size.
Whatever he plays *T*-2, Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself--"something greater *ICH*-3 out there than me," as he puts it *?* during an interview at the Manhattan apartment 0 he shares *T*-1 with wife, Camille, a literary publicist.
"A normal person did not write the Beethoven ` Violin Concerto,"' he declares *T*-1.
"Even when I hear it played * badly *T*-1, I'm still humbled *-2 by the piece.
If I could ever feel 0 I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it."

AEG AG and Siemens AG said 0 they will launch their previously announced joint venture for power semiconductors in January.
The two West German electronics concerns said 0 they have set up European Power Semiconductor Co. *PRO*-1 to merge their activities in the field.
AEG and Siemens each will hold a 50% stake in the venture.
The joint venture will have nominal capital of 50 million marks ($26.9 million *U*) and 700 employees.
It will develop, produce and market high - performance electronic parts.

It's a California crime saga worthy of an Erle Stanley Gardner title: The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees.
Edward Carlson awoke one morning last month *PRO*-1 to find eight holes in his front yard where his prized miniature palms, called * *PRO*-3 cycads, once stood *T*-2.
Days later, the thieves returned and dug out more, *PRO*-1 this time adding insult to injury.
"The second time," he says *?*, "they left the shovel."
*PRO*-2 No garden - variety crime, palm - tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California, *PRO*-2 bringing big bucks to crooks who *T*-1 know their botany.
Cycads, the most popular of which *T*-1 is the Sago Palm, are doll - sized versions of California's famous long - necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern - like fronds.
Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two - foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000 *U*, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more *U*.
"Evidently, somebody has realized 0 it *EXP*-2's easy money *PRO* to steal these things," says *T*-1 Loran Whitelock, a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum.
Just last week, *PRO* would - be thieves damaged three Sagos at Mr. Whitelock's home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened them off, *PRO*-1 foiled.
"It *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to think 0 someone is raping your garden," he says *T*-1.
Police suspect that the criminals, who *T*-1 dig up the plants in the dead of night, are selling them to nurseries or landscapers.
The Sago has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts, *PRO* apparently giving the rustlers a ready market for their filched fronds.
Thieves are going *-3 to find "anybody who *T*-2 has enough bucks 0 *PRO* to plant these things in their front yard *T*-4," says 0 *T*-5 William Morrissey, an investigator with the police department in Garden Grove, Calif., where five such thefts have been reported *-1 in the past several weeks *T*-6.
The department is advising residents *PRO*-1 to plant Sagos, if they must *?*, in the back yard and telling nurseries *PRO*-2 to be on the lookout for anyone trying *PRO* to palm one off.
But for those Californians who *T*-1 want exotic gardens out front where neighbors can appreciate them *T*-2, there's always Harold Smith's approach.
After three Sagos were stolen *-1 from his home in Garden Grove, "I put a big iron stake in the ground and tied the tree to the stake with a chain," he says *T*-2 proudly.
"And you can't cut this chain with bolt cutters.
A group of shareholders filed suit against Imperial Corp. of America, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., First Executive Corp. and others, *PRO*-1 charging them with *PRO*-2 artificially inflating Imperial's stock price *PRO*-3 to protect certain major investors.
The complaint, filed * in federal district court, accuses Imperial and other defendants of *PRO*-1 issuing false and misleading financial data.
It also charges that Imperial, the holding company for Imperial Savings & Loan, experienced major losses and writedowns because of improper assessment of the risks of junk - bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages.
The suit seeks unspecified damages.
Imperial is in the midst of *PRO*-1 reducing its junk - bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order *PRO*-2 to return to traditional thrift activities.
The derivative suit is similar to a class - action complaint filed * earlier this year.
Imperial said in a statement 0 it expects other complaints to be filed *-3 in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in Barron's magazine that *T*-2 focused on the company's problems.
Although an Imperial spokesman said 0 the company hadn't yet been served *-1 with the derivative suit, he reiterated the company's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class - action suit.
Spokesmen at Drexel and First Executive said 0 the companies hadn't yet been served *-1 with the suit.
In a separate complaint also filed * in federal court here, shareholder Max Grill of New York charged Imperial, its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and *PRO*-1 squandering the company's assets.
Imperial said 0 it hadn't been served *-1 with this suit either.
"The croaker's done gone from the hook --
damn!
My language sure goes to pot down here on the coast."
The husky blond guide with the Aggie cap twists his face in mock fury.
"I got *-1 to get back to school and straighten out my English."
He has two more years at Texas A&M.
Right now he takes people out *PRO*-3 to fish in the bays behind the barrier islands that *T*-2 curve for hundreds of miles along the eastern coast of Texas, *PRO*-4 enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that *T*-1 rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond.
There have been three days of hot, wind - swept rain, and now with the first sun we are after speckled seatrout, which *T*-1 with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts.
The little radio fizzes as other boats want *PRO*-1 to see if we have found any fish--*PRO* spotting location is everything in this sport.
Negative answers crackle back.
The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that *T*-1 dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships.
We go from one to the other.
The sun is hot now though it's only 8 in the morning.
The great silver clouds on the horizon build themselves on the pale water.
We cruise toward another set of pilings.
The guide scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook.
Then he casts out.
"*PRO* Just wait for that tap - tap, that thump - thump.
It comes real gentle before it pulls.
*PRO* Don't forget, 0 trout have very soft mouths."
The radio queries again.
"*PRO* Pickin' one or two," says *T*-1 the guide, *PRO*-2 chuckling.
"You can tell 0 they've got nothin'."
A pair of black skimmers zig - zag past close to the surface.
Soon we have our limit of the shimmering fish stippled in rose - gold and black.
And we are the first back at the dock, where the great blue herons stand *PRO*-1 waiting by the cleaning benches *T*-2.
The guide is young and he knows this business but he wants a different life after college, such as *PRO* working for IBM and wearing a necktie.
This must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that *T*-1 is "undeveloped."
There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby.
People are not apt *-1 to be self - conscious about the place or themselves.
Texas is big and beautiful and they live here, that's all.
Jutting out just to the north of us is *T*-2 the Blackjack Peninsula (after the oak, not the game) which *T*-1 forms the core of the Aransas Wildlife Refuge.
It is famous as the winter home of the whooping crane, that symbol of the destruction of wild America.
Last year a gunner shot a whooper by mistake *PRO*-1 thinking that it was a snow goose.
He paid an immense fine and was lucky *ICH*-2, according to a local wag, *PRO*-1 to escape the gas chamber.
The peninsula comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see *?*.
Near the coast there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed * with marshes and prairies.
Deer, wild hog, armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds *ICH*-1 are innumerable, especially the herons and the spoonbills.
Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea the inky - brown and golden palamedes butterfly floats on its lazy wingbeat.
Inland a few miles from the refuge there is a place called * *PRO*-1 Tivoli, with a white church, a gas station and a grocery, the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts.
"Tivoli Motel," I read a sign in the usual pronunciation of the name as we whoosh through.
"Here in south Texas we say Tie - vole - ee," my host gently corrects *T*-1.

Burmah Oil PLC, a British independent oil and specialty - chemicals marketing concern, said 0 SHV Holdings N.V. has built up a 7.5% stake in the company.
The holding of 13.6 million shares is up from a 6.7% stake 0 that Burmah announced 0 SHV held *T*-1 as of last Monday.
SHV, of the Netherlands, which *T*-3 last year merged its North Sea oil and gas operations with those of Calor Group PLC and which *T*-2 owns 40% of Calor, was identified *-1 as a possible suitor for Burmah.
Burmah said 0 it hadn't held any discussions with SHV and that "no deal of any nature is in contemplation.
Japan's wholesale prices in the first 10 days of October fell 0.3% from the previous 10 days but rose 3.3% from a year ago, the Bank of Japan said 0 *T*-1.
The wholesale price index stood at 89.6 (1985 equals 100).
Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance PLC, a major British composite insurer, said 0 it is taking a stake in Nationwide Anglia Building Society's estate agency business as part of a plan *PRO* to create a range of commercial linkages in the U.K. and Europe.
Officials declined *PRO*-2 to disclose the value of the transaction or the exact stake that GRE will hold *T*-1 in Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents.
But the companies said that Nationwide Anglia Estate Agents will market GRE life insurance, pension and investment products through its more than 1,000 retail outlets in the U.K.
Besides the marketing agreement, GRE said 0 Nationwide Anglia has agreed *PRO*-1 to develop life insurance products with the composite insurer.
How interestingly clever *T*-3 of Robert Goldberg *PRO*-1 to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism *PRO*-2 to explain his perception of "Days of Rage" in his television critique (Leisure & Arts, Sept 11).
He chastises Jo Franklin - Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism, *PRO*-1 judging her project as "intellectually slipshod."
Was not the title very clear?
One example 0 he gives *T*-1: "She didn't ask" (why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones *T*-2).
Really now, did she have *-1 to ask?
Were not the pictures and happenings, which *T*-1 have been continuing news headlines, answers enough?
Mr. Goldberg contends that even as "propaganda" the film fails because it presents only one view.
Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment; of course the Israelis feel put upon.
But his complaint that "Days of Rage" doesn't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving *T*-1 is irrelevant.
It's like *PRO* doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given *-1 to how terrific white South Africans are *T*-2.
This film did emphasize how long the Israeli / Palestinian stalemate has existed *T*-3 by *PRO*-7 tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried *PRO*-4 to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without *PRO*-6 specifying how it was *PRO*-8 to be done *-1 *T*-5 *T*-2.
Well, "Days of Rage" airing with before - and - after packaging, and after repeated delays, was a beginning.
Every issue is multisided.
This film attempts *PRO*-1 to show a side rarely seen in our media.
Now we must endure a rash of critics who *T*-1 apparently wish *PRO*-2 to know details of one side only.

Japan's Finance Ministry strongly denied *PRO*-1 playing any role in the New York stock - price free fall.
Makoto Utsumi, vice minister for international affairs, said 0 the ministry didn't in any way suggest to Japanese banks that they stay out of the UAL Corp. leveraged buy - out.
The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy - outs in general, Mr. Utsumi said 0 *T*-1.
"There are no facts {behind the assertions} that we sent any kind of signal," he declared *T*-2 in an interview.
The comments were the ministry's first detailed public statement on the subject, and reflect the ministry's concern that foreigners will think 0 Japan is using its tremendous financial power *PRO*-1 to control events in foreign markets.
A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of *PRO* pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another.
Mr. Utsumi said 0 the most 0 the ministry had ever done *T*-1 was *PRO* ask Japanese banks about "the status of their participation" in one previous U.S. leveraged buy - out.
The ministry inquired about that deal--which Mr. Utsumi declined *PRO*-3 to identify *T*-2--because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was "being strongly criticized *-1 in the U.S. Congress" and it *EXP*-4 was "necessary for us to grasp the situation."
He said 0 the inquiry wasn't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted *T*-2 as *PRO*-1 either encouraging or discouraging participation, and he added that none of the Japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry.
Mr. Utsumi also said 0 some Japanese banks were willing *PRO*-2 to participate in the UAL financing up to the very end, which *T*-1 would suggest at the very least that they weren't under orders *PRO* to back out.
In general, Mr. Utsumi said *?*, Japanese banks are becoming more "independent" in their approach to overseas deals.
"Each Japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that {UAL} deal," he said *T*-1.
"They are becoming more independent.
It's a sound phenomenon."
Sanwa Bank Ltd. is one Japanese bank that *T*-1 decided *PRO*-2 not to participate in the first UAL proposal.
A Sanwa Bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank's decision.
"We made our own decision," he said *T*-1.
Still, Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time *PRO*-2 convincing market analysts who *T*-1 have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in *PRO* orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks.
All week there has been much speculation *ICH*-1 in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry's real position.
Bank analysts say 0 ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned *ICH*-1 during the past few months about Japanese banks getting in over their heads.
"The {ministry} thinks 0 the banks don't know what they are doing *T*-2, that they have very little idea how *PRO* to cope with risk *T*-3," said *T*-4 one foreign bank analyst who *T*-1 asked *PRO*-5 not to be identified *-6.
"The {ministry} wants *PRO*-2 to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns" on leveraged buy - outs, he added 0 *T*-1.
Although some of the Japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for UAL bowed out because they found the terms unattractive, observers here say 0 they have a hard time *PRO*-1 believing that commercial considerations were the only reason.
Japanese banks are under "political pressure" as well, the analyst said 0 *T*-1.
Moreover, analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for *PRO*-2 doing deals that *T*-1 aren't extremely profitable if they offer the chance *PRO* to build market share, cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats.
Clearly, some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy - outs.
At a news conference this week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks *PRO*-1 to take a "prudent" stance regarding highly leveraged deals.
Despite Mr. Sumita's statements, it is the Finance Ministry, not the central bank, that *T*-1 makes policy decisions.
While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy - out fever, Japanese banks aren't likely *-1 to walk away from the game.
Despite the risks, the deals can be an attractive way for Japanese banks to increase their presence in the U.S. market, bank analysts say 0 *T*-1.
*PRO*-2 Flush with cash at home, but with fewer customers to lend to *-1, leading banks are eager *PRO* to expand overseas.
*PRO* Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way 0 *T*-1 to leapfrog the problem of *PRO* not having a strong retail - banking network.
Immunex Corp. said 0 its scientists isolated a molecule which *T*-1 may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune - system, ranging from organ - transplant rejection, to allergies and asthma.
The molecule is the mouse version of a protein called * *PRO*-5 the interleukin - 4 receptor.
IL - 4 is a hormone which *T*-5 directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved * in the body's immune response.
The IL - 4 receptor on the surface of such cells receives the hormone's message *PRO* to rally the body's defense.
But in certain conditions such as autoimmune diseases and allergies and transplant rejection, doctors would like *PRO*-1 to damp the immune response so such cells don't touch off harmful inflammatory reactions or cell destruction.
A soluble form of the receptor might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune suppression, the company said 0 *T*-1.
The IL - 4 receptor is one of five such receptors 0 *T*-2 to be *-3 developed and tested by Receptech Corp., a spinoff of Immunex, through a proposed $30 million *U* initial public offering.
Immunex will contract with the spinoff *PRO*-1 to provide the research, development and initial testing of the new agents.
Immunex will have the option *PRO* to buy back Receptech shares after five years.
Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss .) of the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $2.85 billion *U* emergency funding package 0 *PRO* to assist California's recovery from last week's earthquake and extend further aid to East Coast victims of Hurricane Hugo *T*-1.
The sweeping measure incorporates $500 million *U* in small - business loans, $1 billion *U* in highway - construction funds and $1.25 billion *U* divided * between general emergency assistance and a reserve 0 *T*-2 to be available to President Bush *PRO* to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.
The funds would be attached *-1 to a stop - gap spending bill required *PRO* to keep most of the government *PRO*-2 operating past Wednesday.
The measure is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to be taken *-1 up by the Appropriations Committee today.
The panel is expected *-1 to add provisions waiving restrictions on the use of federal highway funds and may also shift money within the package *PRO*-1 to bolster the share for the Small Business Administration.
"We will support it, we will thank him, and we will augment it where appropriate *T*-2," said *T*-1 Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif .).
*PRO*-1 Dubbed the "Dire Emergency Supplemental 0 *T*-2 to Meet the Needs of Natural Disasters of National Significance," the measure is vintage Whitten in *PRO* asserting federal responsibility and in *PRO* disdaining budget impediments.
"Such other amounts will be made *-2 available subsequently as required," the legislation reads 0 *?*, and the new obligations "shall not be a charge against the Budget Act, Gramm - Rudman - Hollings, or other ceilings.
Oil Spill Case Shows Liability Fund Flaws
AN UNRESOLVED two - year - old dispute stemming from an Alaskan oil spill has helped *PRO* spur a drive for tougher federal laws 0 *T*-2 to protect victims of such accidents.
The class - action suit highlights shortcomings of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund, which *T*-1 gets its money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills.
On July 2, 1987, the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay struck a rock and spilled almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet.
Commercial fishermen and fish processors filed suit in federal court in a claim that *T*-1 has ballooned to more than $104.8 million *U*.
Defendants include British Petroleum America; Trinidad Corp., the shipper; and the pipeline liability fund.
The fund was created *-1 by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Act, which *T*-2 provides that the owner or operator of a vessel involved * in an oil spill must pay the first $14 million *U* in damages.
The fund is required *-1 *PRO*-2 to pay claims up to an additional $86 million *U*.
The fund's purpose is *PRO* to provide quick and adequate relief.
But the Glacier Bay case, the fund's first test, shows how easily the fund can be undermined *-1 *T*-2.
Trinidad Corp. is contesting liability.
It claims 0 the Coast Guard failed *-1 to chart the rock and refuses *PRO*-1 to pay damages.
That means 0 the fund isn't obligated *-1 *PRO*-2 to pay anything, at least so far.
The Oil Pollution Act, scheduled *PRO* to come up for a vote in Congress this fall, would provide that if claimants aren't paid within 90 days of a spill, the liability fund would compensate them and seek reimbursement from the owner or operator of the vessel, says 0 *T*-1 a spokesman for Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.), a sponsor of the bill.
The spokesman says 0 the "glitch" in the statute is "the worst kind of Catch - 22."
Many Law School Grads Find 0 Classes Never End
RECENT LAW school graduates are starting jobs with law firms this fall--and heading back to class.
Bar associations and consultants are offering more programs 0 *PRO* to teach associates all 0 they need *-2 to know *T*-1 about law but didn't learn *T*-1 in law school *T*-3.
"Law school teaches wonderful theory, but it doesn't teach the nuts and bolts of practical lawyering," says *T*-2 Aaron Weitz, head of a New York County Lawyers' Association committee that *T*-1 sponsors such a course.
In the past, associates learned the basics from senior lawyers who *T*-1 acted as mentors.
But these days, large firms hire as many as 30 new associates a year, and it *EXP*-2's impossible *PRO* to personally train everyone, says 0 *T*-3 Joel Henning of Hildebrandt Inc., a consulting firm that *T*-1 runs training classes.
The Hildebrandt course enables students *PRO*-1 to brush up on negotiation skills by role playing in simulated deals.
Students also are taught *-1 *PRO*-2 to return clients' phone calls immediately and to treat the support staff with respect.
Many law firms sponsor their own programs.
At the Baltimore firm of Weinberg & Green, new corporate and banking associates are required *-1 *PRO*-2 to enroll in a 20 - class course.
Partners lecture on how *PRO* to form corporations, draft agreements and defend clients against unwanted tender offers *T*-1.
Now, clients know that new associates have had some practical training before *PRO*-2 working on their cases, says 0 *T*-1 James J. Hanks, a partner at the firm.
Los Angeles Creates A Courthouse for Kids
THE CHILDREN of Los Angeles will soon have their own $52 million *U* courthouse.
The building, which *T*-1 will handle child abuse, custody and foster care cases, will be "less formal, less threatening and just basically less grim than most courthouses," says 0 *T*-2 Edmund Edelman, chairman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.
Designs call for an L - shaped structure with a playground in the center.
There will be recreation and movie rooms.
Teens will be able *PRO*-1 to listen to music with headsets.
Study halls, complete with reference materials, will be available.
And there will be a nurse's station and rooms 0 for children to meet with social workers *T*-1.
The building's 25 courtrooms will be smaller, says 0 *T*-1 Charlene Saunders, a court administrator.
The bench will be lower so the judge seems *-1 less intimidating, and walls will be painted *-2 in bright colors and covered *-2 with murals.
Cases in Los Angeles County involving dependent children are usually heard in the Criminal Courts Building.
"We need *-1 to get the kids away from the criminals into a less traumatic environment," says *T*-2 Mr. Edelman.
About 45,000 children in Los Angeles County are under court supervision, Mr. Edelman says 0 *?*, and an average of 1,500 new children are added *-1 each month.
The courthouse, *PRO* to be built *-1 in Monterey Park, is expected *-2 to open in the spring of 1992.
Law Firm Management Can Be Quite Rewarding
IT *EXP*-2 PAYS *PRO*-1 to follow a management career path--even at law firms.
That's the conclusion of a recent study of large law firms conducted * by Altman & Weil Inc., an Ardmore, Pa., law firm consultant.
Its survey of 96 firms, each with 100 to 1,000 lawyers, shows that managing partners earned an average of $395,974 *U* in compensation and cash benefits in the firms' 1988 fiscal years.
Managing partners who *T*-1 responded to the survey typically spend over half their time *PRO*-4 supervising their firms' day - to - day operations and just a little more than a third of their time *PRO*-4 practicing law.
Partners in the survey who *T*-1 devote most of their time to *PRO*-2 practicing law earned an average of about $217,000 *U*.
*PRO* Move over, pornographic phone services: A legal service with a "900" number has been launched *-1 in California.
A Newport Beach law firm started the *PRO* pay - as - you - go legal service, called * *PRO*-2 Telelawyer, *PRO*-1 using MCI Communication Corp.'s toll - tele - phone service.
Cane & Associates touts its $2 *U* - a - minute service as the "cheapest legal hour 0 you'll ever find *T*-1."
Though the service is available only in California, Telelawyer founder Michael Cane says 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to franchise it in other states.
He says 0 his aim is *PRO* to reach people who *T*-1 are bedridden, have no access to transportation, can't find a lawyer 0 *T*-2 to take their case or simply can't afford lawyers' consultation fees.
Mr. Cane stresses that he isn't using the telephone *PRO*-1 to lure clients to his doorstep.
"We will only deal with clients on the phone," he says *T*-1.
"We have no in - office business."
Telelawyer is apparently the only telephone service that *T*-1 offers the telephone equivalent of an office visit.
Local bar associations in some states have numbers that *T*-1 provide free tape - recorded messages explaining certain areas of the law.
There also are "800" hotlines which *T*-1 refer people to lawyers, usually personal - injury specialists, for in - office consultation.
When a caller reaches Telelawyer by *PRO*-2 dialing 900 - TELELAW *T*-1, a receptionist refers the call to one of six attorneys.
In an effort *PRO* to determine whether a caller has reason 0 *PRO* to sue *T*-2, Cane lawyers review documents and perform research, if necessary, with the help of three law clerks and several support staffers.
There is no charge for research--only for time on the phone.
If the matter requires further legal work or litigation, Mr. Cane says *?*, his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm.
But he says 0 Cane & Associates doesn't receive referral fees.
So far, says *?* Mr. Cane, most calls have involved landlord - tenant problems, tax problems, divorce, and probate questions.
The firm is getting about 50 calls a day, and the average call lasts about 15 minutes.
Out of the $2 *U* charge, the law firm pockets about $1.55 *U*.
JURY CONVICTS congressman in connection with Wedtech Corp. scandal.
A federal court jury in New York found U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia (D., N.Y .) and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, guilty of *PRO* extorting $76,000 *U* from Wedtech in return for official acts by the congressman.
The jury also convicted them of extortion in *PRO* obtaining a $20,000 *U*, interest - free loan from a Wedtech officer.
The jury found them guilty of conspiracy in *PRO* obtaining the payments, some of which *T*-3 were disguised *-1 as fees for consulting services from Mrs. Garcia.
Wedtech, which *T*-1 became embroiled in political - corruption cases that eventually *T*-2 led to its demise, formerly was a minority - owned South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor.
Edward J.M. Little, one of the assistant U.S. attorneys who *T*-1 prosecuted the case, said 0 the Garcia trial "is the last of the Wedtech prosecutions."
Mr. Little said 0 more than 20 people have been convicted in the Wedtech cases, including former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi (D., N.Y .).
Lawyers for the Garcias said 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to appeal.
Mr. Garcia, who *T*-1 represents New York's 18th congressional district, which *T*-2 includes the Bronx, said 0 he hasn't decided whether he will resign.
"In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my political advisers and with the Democratic leaders about the best way of *PRO* preserving the interests of my constituents," said 0 *T*-1 Mr. Garcia, 56 years old.
Mrs. Garcia, 49, formerly was a member of Mr. Garcia's congressional staff.
The Garcias were cleared *-1 of four other felony counts, involving the receipt of bribes and gratuities.
U.S. Judge Leonard B. Sand set the Garcias' sentencing for Jan. 5.
FIVE SHEA & GOULD PARTNERS are leaving *PRO*-1 to form a new firm.
The new firm, Hutton Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti, will be based *-1 in New York.
The five partners who *T*-1 resigned from Shea & Gould late last week are Tom Hutton, Sam Ingram, Dean Yuzek, Daniel Carroll and Ernest Bertolotti.
They will be joined *-1 by Larry Gainen, who *T*-2 resigned from the firm of LePatner, Gainen & Block.
Howard Rubenstein, a New York publicist who *T*-1 represents Shea & Gould, said, "Shea & Gould understands 0 they're leaving because they wanted a different environment--a smaller firm 0 they would be principals of *T*-2."
Mr. Rubenstein said 0 the five, who *T*-1 weren't on Shea & Gould's management committee, "are leaving on good terms."
He said 0 Shea & Gould held a number of discussions with the five partners during the past few weeks *PRO*-2 to get them to stay but that the five were firmly committed to *PRO*-1 running their own firm.
Hutton Ingram will have a general corporate, securities, real - estate and litigation practice, and a substantial practice serving the professional - design community.
DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS against lawyers open to public in Illinois.
While investigations into lawyer misconduct will remain secret, the public will be notified *-1 once a formal complaint is filed *-2 against an attorney.
The actual disciplinary hearings will be public.
In addition, Illinois attorneys will lose the right *PRO* to sue clients who *T*-1 file malicious complaints against them.
Non-lawyers will be added *-1 to the inquiry panels that *T*-2 look into allegations of misconduct.
Illinois joins 36 other states that *T*-1 allow public participation in attorney - disciplinary proceedings and 32 states that *T*-2 open disciplinary hearings to the public, according to the American Bar Association.
One vocal critic of the changes, Chicago lawyer Warren Lupel, says 0 non-lawyers shouldn't be on the inquiry panels because they are unlikely *-1 to appreciate the nuances of attorney - client relationships.
In addition, he says 0 *?*, *PRO* publishing the names of lawyers who *T*-1 are facing charges unnecessarily subjects them to public derogation.
Nevertheless, Mr. Lupel anticipates no legal action *PRO* to reverse the Illinois Supreme Court's decision *PRO* to institute the changes.
"There's no constitutional right involved * in the rule change," he says *T*-1.
"You don't have a right *PRO*-1 to practice.
You only have a privilege *PRO*-1 to practice."
DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT Inc. agreed *PRO*-3 to pay a $50,000 *U* fine to Delaware, the 26th state 0 *T*-2 to settle with Drexel in the wake of the firm's guilty plea to federal insider - trading charges.
Drexel doesn't have a Delaware office, but the New York firm has been negotiating settlements that *T*-1 would allow it to operate freely nationwide despite its record as an admitted felon.
The firm has said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to pay $11.5 million *U* overall *PRO*-2 to settle with states.
Drexel pleaded guilty *ICH*-1 in September to six felony counts of securities and mail fraud; it also made a $650 million *U* civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Your Oct. 2 article on Daniel Yankelovich cited the quote "A good name is better than great riches" as *PRO* being from Cervantes' "Don Quixote."
Actually, Cervantes borrowed that quote from a writer of some 25 centuries earlier: Israel's King Solomon wrote those words in the Book of Proverbs (22:1).
Michael E. Hill
Troubled Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units, with potential suitors including Interpublic Group, but has rejected them, people familiar with the company said 0 *T*-1.
Industry executives said 0 Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about *PRO* buying its Campbell - Mithun - Esty unit, but was turned down *-1 by Chairman Maurice Saatchi.
More recently, Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi's smaller communications companies--identified * as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives--but again was rebuffed, they said 0 *T*-1.
Interpublic's chairman and chief executive officer, Philip Geier Jr., made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London, the executives said 0 *T*-1.
A Saatchi spokesman declined *PRO*-1 to comment about Interpublic.
But the spokesman confirmed that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested * in *PRO* acquiring its Campbell - Mithun and Rowland units.
He added, "We have no intention of *PRO*-1 selling either business."
Interpublic declined comment.
The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19 - year history.
Takeover speculation has been rife, its consulting business is on the block, and its largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, has said 0 it's been approached *-1 by third parties regarding a possible restructuring.
Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company, and their outlook, at least for the short term, is bleak.
In the midst of the current turmoil, Saatchi is attempting *PRO*-1 to shore up its ad businesses.
It named a new chief executive officer, former IMS International head Robert Louis - Dreyfus.
It rebuffed an offer *ICH*-1 by Carl Spielvogel, head of Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit, *PRO* to lead a management buy - out of all or part of Saatchi.
And last week, people close to Saatchi said 0 Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles, would lead a buy - out if a hostile bid emerged.
But Saatchi's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested * in *PRO* picking off pieces of its ad businesses.
While Saatchi's major agency networks--Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising--would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts, its smaller businesses are quite attractive.
Campbell - Mithun - Esty, for example, has had big problems at its New York office, but offers strong offices in other areas of the country, including Minneapolis and Chicago.
That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that *T*-1 already has a healthy New York presence.
(While there would be some client conflicts, they wouldn't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi's other agencies.)
Campbell - Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network: It has billings of about $850 million *U* and blue - chip clients including General Mills, Jeep / Eagle and Dow Brands.
Rowland, meanwhile, has expanded aggressively, and now ranks as the fifth - largest U.S. public relations firm, according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms.
It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic, one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own.
Other Saatchi units include ad agency McCaffrey & McCall, which *T*-1 has the Mercedes account and which *T*-2 has been attempting *PRO*-3 to buy itself back; and Howard Marlboro, a sports and event marketing firm.
Despite Saatchi's firm stand against *PRO* selling its ad units, U.S. analysts believe 0 the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units.
Mr. Louis - Dreyfus, in a recent interview, said 0 he might sell "a marginal agency or office."
Analysts believe 0 he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses.
Prudential's Final Four
Prudential Insurance Co. of America said 0 it selected four agencies *PRO*-1 to pitch its $60 million to $70 million *U* account.
In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi unit that *T*-1 has handled the account since 1970, the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk, a unit of the Lowe Group; Grey Advertising; and WPP Group's Scali, McCabe, Sloves agency.
All agencies are New York - based.
A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm, based * in Newark, N.J., said 0 it hopes *PRO*-1 to make a decision within three to four months.
Jamaica Fires Back
The Jamaica Tourist Board, in the wake of Young & Rubicam's indictment on charges that it bribed Jamaican officials *PRO*-1 to win the account in 1981, released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident.
The memo attempts *PRO*-2 to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency, which *T*-1 pleaded innocent to the charges.
Among other things, the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn't uncover any information that *T*-1 would "embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board."
It also contends that Young & Rubicam never told the tourist board about its relationship with Ad Ventures, a Jamaican firm hired * by the agency.
The U.S. indictment charges 0 Ad Ventures was a front used * *PRO* to funnel kickbacks to the then - minister of tourism.
The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement *ICH*-1 Thursday that it would no longer handle the $5 million to $6 million *U* account.
The agency declined comment, but said 0 it will continue work until a new agency is chosen *-1.
Ad Notes....
NEW ACCOUNT
: American Suzuki Motor Corp., Brea, Calif., awarded its estimated $10 million to $30 million *U* account to Asher / Gould, Los Angeles.
Also participating in the finals was *T*-1 Los Angeles agency Hakuhodo Advertising America.
American Suzuki's previous agency, Keye / Donna / Pearlstein, didn't participate.
AYER TALKS:
N W Ayer's president and chief executive officer, Jerry J. Siano, said 0 the agency is holding "conversations" about *PRO* acquiring Zwiren Collins Karo & Trusk, a midsized Chicago agency, but a deal isn't yet close to *PRO*-2 being completed *-1.
WHO *T*-2'S NEWS:
John Wells, 47, former president and chief executive of N W Ayer's Chicago office, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 management director and director of account services at WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson agency in Chicago....
Shelly Lazarus, 42, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief operating officer of Ogilvy & Mather Direct, the direct mail division of WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather agency.
Diversification pays.
That's a fundamental lesson for investors, but its truth was demonstrated *-1 once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market's Friday - the - 13th plunge.
Stock funds, like the market as a whole, generally dropped more than 2% in the week through last Thursday, according to figures compiled * by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday, last Monday's rebound and the dips and blips that *T*-1 followed.
But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market's slide.
Funds that *T*-1 invest internationally were the top - performing stock and fixed - income funds.
"More than ever, people should realize 0 they should have a diversified portfolio," said *T*-1 Jeremy Duffield, a senior vice president of Vanguard Group.
"That means stocks, bonds, money market instruments and real estate."
One week's performance shouldn't be the basis for any investment decision.
But the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what *T*-1 can happen when the going gets rough *T*-2.
"You want *PRO*-1 to know how a fund did when the market got hammered *T*-3 *T*-2," said *T*-4 Kurt Brouwer, an investment adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco.
"It's like *PRO* kicking the tires of a car....
What you want *PRO*-2 to know *T*-1 is when the road's rough *T*-3, when there's snow and ice *T*-4, how's this car going *-5 to perform *T*-6?"
General equity funds fell an average of 2.35% in the week ended * Thursday, compared with a 2.32% slide for the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index.
But Lipper Analytical's figures show that there were a number of ways 0 investors could have cushioned themselves from the stock market's gyrations *T*-1.
Gold - oriented funds, for instance, which *T*-1 invest in companies that *T*-2 mine and process the precious metal, posted an average decline of 1.15%.
Flexible portfolio funds, which *T*-1 allocate investments among stocks, bonds and money - market instruments and other investments, declined at about half the rate of stock funds--an average drop of 1.27%, according to Lipper.
Global allocation funds take the asset - allocation concept one step further by *PRO*-1 investing at least 25% of their portfolios outside the U.S. .
This gives them the added benefits of international diversification--including a foreign - exchange boost during periods, like the past week, when the dollar declines against other major currencies *T*-1.
With all that going for them, global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07% in the week through last Thursday.
But while the merits of diversification shine through when times are tough *T*-1, there's also a price 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-2: A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot *T*-3.
And Friday the 13th notwithstanding, stocks have been this year's hot investment.
Thus, even including the latest week, the average general stock fund has soared more than 24% so far this year, the Lipper Analytical figures show 0 *T*-1.
By comparison, global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19%, while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17%.
Fixed - income funds have returned 8.2%, while gold funds, which *T*-1 tend *-2 to be volatile, have risen just 4.55%, on average.
"That's the problem with *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to hedge too much," said *T*-2 Mr. Brouwer.
"You don't make any real money."
Over the last 20 years, for example, Mr. Brouwer says *?*, an investor putting $5,000 *U* a year in the S&P 500 would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested *-1 in Treasury bills.
Some equity funds did better than others in the week that *T*-1 began on Friday the 13th.
The $4 million *U* Monetta Fund, for instance, was the seventh top performing fund for the week, with a 2.65% return.
Its return so far this year has been a credible 21.71%.
The fund's strategy is *PRO* to sell when a stock appreciates 30% over its cost *T*-1.
By the time 0 the market plummeted 10 days ago *T*-1, Monetta was 55% in cash, said 0 *T*-2 Robert Bacarella, president and portfolio manager.
Last Monday, he started "*-2 buying the high - quality growth companies that people were throwing away *T*-1 at discount prices."
Among Mr. Bacarella's picks: Oracle Systems, Reebok International Ltd. and Digital Microwave Corp.
The fund's cash position is now about 22%, which Mr. Bacarella calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 "still bearish."
Among the big stock funds, Dreyfus Fund, with more than $2 billion *U* in assets, had a decline of just 1.49% for the week and a return of 21.42% for the year.
Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp., said 0 the fund was about half invested in government bonds on Oct. 13, and about 10% in cash.
"In a downward market, bonds act better," he said *T*-1.
"We still think 0 there's a lot of unsettlement in this market.
We believe 0 interest rates will continue *-1 to trend lower, and the economy will slow around the world."
Many of the funds that *T*-2 did best in the last week are heavily invested *-1 overseas, *PRO* giving them the benefit of foreign currency translations when the dollar is weak *T*-3.
From its high point on Thursday, Oct. 12, to where it traded late in New York a week later *T*-1, the dollar fell 3.6% against the West German mark, 3.4% against the British pound and 2.1% against the Japanese yen.
Three International Cash Portfolios funds, which *T*-1 invest almost exclusively in bonds and money - market instruments overseas, were among the four top - performing funds in the latest week.
Because the funds' investments are denominated *-1 in foreign currencies, their value expressed * in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar *T*-2.
But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies *T*-1, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines.
All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date.
Of the funds that *T*-2 fared the worst in the post-Oct . 13 week, two are heavily invested *-1 in airlines stocks, which *T*-3 led the market slide following problems with financing for the UAL Corp . buy - out plan.
*PRO*-1 Reflecting airline takeover activity, however, both the Fidelity Select Air Transportation Portfolio and the National Aviation & Technology fund posted better - than - average returns for the the year to date: 30.09% for the Fidelity Air Transportation fund and a whopping 47.24% for National Aviation & Technology.
The small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign, said 0 *T*-1 A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.
*PRO*-2 Noting that equity funds are up nearly 60% from their post-crash low on Dec. 3, 1987, he said that what *T*-1 happened last week "may not be enough of an adjustment.
There's either more 0 *T*-1 to come or an extremely long period of dullness."
But investors don't seem *-1 to think so.
Several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th.
Vanguard Group said 0 it had a more than $50 million *U* net inflow into its stock funds last week.
"There certainly hasn't been a panic reaction," said *T*-1 Steven Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates.
"People showed some staying power and, in fact, interest in *PRO* buying equities."

The top state environmental official in Massachusetts said 0 Clean Harbors Inc.'s environmental - impact statement for a proposed incinerator in Braintree was inadequate.
The official, John DeVillars, asked Clean Harbors for more information before *PRO*-1 ruling on a permit for the site.
Critics of the plan, including the town of Braintree, say 0 the incinerator is a health hazard.
Clean Harbors, based * in Quincy, said 0 it "will proceed expeditiously" *PRO*-1 to submit the data requested *.
Alan McKim, chief executive officer of Clean Harbors said 0 he was "very much encouraged" by the official's praise of Clean Harbors for the quality of some of the data in the report.
Sotheby's Inc.'s gamble in the art - dealing business appears *PRO*-1 to have paid off.
The New York arm of the London - based auction house auctioned off the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr., the Campbell's Soup Co. heir, for $131 million *U* *ICH*-1 last week, a record for a single - owner art collection.
That total was below the $140 million *U* 0 the auction house estimated 0 the collection might sell for *T*-2, but was enough *PRO* to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement 0 Sotheby's had made *T*-1 with the Dorrance family proved *-3 profitable to the auction house.
Sotheby's provided the Dorrance family a guarantee of at least $100 million *U*, and as much as $120 million *U*, *PRO*-4 to obtain the collection, people familiar with the transaction said 0 *?*, thus *PRO* taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property 0 *T*-2 to be sold *-1.
The Dorrance estate, auctioned * off in a series of sales held * over four days, included porcelains, furniture and paintings.
An Henri Matisse, auctioned * last Wednesday, fetched $12.4 million *U*, a world record for the artist.
In addition, a handful of paintings from the Dorrance collection remain *-2 to be sold *-1 at Sotheby's annual old masters paintings auction in January.
Falcon Cable Systems Co. said 0 it proposed an amendment that *T*-1 would allow it to increase its debt cap to 65% of the company's fair market value from the 40% currently allowed.
Falcon, a limited partnership, said 0 it wanted the increase in order *PRO*-1 to continue its $2.15 *U* - per - unit annual payment, and for expansion and acquisitions.
A spokesman for the company said 0 a meeting would be held *-1 for shareholders to vote on the amendment before year's end.
David Baltimore, who *T*-2 has just been named *-1 *PRO*-5 president of Rockefeller University, already knows what it *EXP*-4's like *T*-3 *PRO* to go through life with "Nobel laureate" appended * to one's name.
He is currently experiencing what it *EXP*-2's like *T*-1 *PRO* to have the phrase, "under investigation for scientific fraud," also attached to his name.
The Nobel committee made the first addition; John Dingell's congressional committee created the second.
Both of Dr. Baltimore's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration *PRO* to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution.
It *EXP*-2 came *PRO* to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller's faculty were upset over *RNR*-1 or even opposed to *RNR*-1 Dr. Baltimore's impending appointment.
They were disturbed *-1 at what they regarded *T*-4 as Dr. Baltimore's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee, which *T*-2 held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who *T*-3 had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore.
Readers of these columns ("The Science Police," May 15) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well - known part of the Dingell committee's larger investigation, which *T*-1 touched MIT, Tufts, Duke, the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere.
Rep. Dingell even managed *PRO*-1 to enlist the services of the Secret Service in his investigation of the Baltimore paper.
Insofar as Mr. Dingell has a special interest in NIH and the institutions that *T*-1 receive its funding, the Rockefeller scientists were no doubt discomfited by Dr. Baltimore's unflattering public opinion of this congressional patron, whose behavior *T*-2 reminded Dr. Baltimore of the McCarthy era.
This well may be the first time that the venerable Rockefeller University has brushed up publicly against the intimidations now common in American science *T*-1.
John Dingell demagogues a David Baltimore, animal - rights activists do $3.5 million *U* of damage to labs at the U.Cal - Davis, Meryl Streep decries the horrors of chemistry on talk shows, Jeremy Rifkin files lawsuits in federal court *PRO*-1 to thwart biotech experiments, and Dutch - elm - disease researcher Gary Strobel's own colleagues at Montana State denounce him for "*PRO* violating" EPA rules.
Scientists *ICH*-2 are mistaken *-3 who *T*-1 still think that the anti-science movement in this country isn't their concern or that a David Baltimore could have somehow placated a John Dingell.
(Mr. Dingell, by the way, has decreed another NIH investigation of the Baltimore paper, *PRO* adding to several previous investigations.
Something other than what most scientists would recognize *T*-2 as the truth is being sought *-1 here.)
Fortunately, there are signs that increasing numbers of scientists understand the necessity of *PRO* speaking out.
David Hubel, a Nobel laureate at Harvard, has taken the lead in *PRO* defending research with animals, as has Dr. Michael DeBakey.
NASA defended itself vigorously and successfully against a Rifkin suit 0 *T*-1 to block the Galileo launch.
Scientists need *-1 to understand that while they tend *-2 to believe 0 their work is primarly about *PRO* establishing new knowledge or doing good, today it is also about power.
In a media - linked world, scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work, but they also attract the attention of people who *T*-1 wish *PRO*-2 to gain control over the content, funding and goals of that work.
When a David Baltimore--or the next target--decides 0 it *EXP*-3 is better *PRO* to stand up to these forces *T*-2, his fellow scientists would do well *PRO*-4 to recognize what *T*-1 is fundamentally at stake, and offer their public support.
Citizens & Southern Corp. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement *PRO* to acquire Security Pacific Corp.'s New York - based factoring unit.
Terms of the bank holding companies' agreement weren't disclosed *-1.
Factoring involves the purchase and collection of another company's receivables.
Citizens, based * in Atlanta, said 0 it has about $4.6 billion *U* in factored sales annually; the Security Pacific unit has about $1.8 billion *U* annually.
Security Pacific's factoring business works with companies in the apparel, textile and food industries, among others.
Rochester Telephone Corp. said 0 it completed its purchase of Urban Telephone Corp., of Clintonville, Wis., the second - largest unaffiliated independent telephone company in that state.
Rochester Telephone said 0 the acquisition was made *-1 in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of Urban Telephone, but a price wasn't disclosed.
Urban is the company's first telephone subsidiary in Wisconsin.
Since June, Rochester Telephone signed letters of intent *PRO* to purchase three other Wisconsin firms.
Bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation, after all.
Matthew Lesko, something of a professional defender of government, thought 0 he had a sure - fire winner last summer when he offered $5,000 *U* for the best "verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you *T*-2 *T*-1."
He sent out thousands of news releases from his Kensington, Md., office.
He plugged the contest on Larry King's radio show, on Pat Sajak's television show and on the C - SPAN cable television network.
He talked about it in every speech 0 he made *T*-2 as he roamed the country *PRO*-3 promoting his books, which *T*-1 dispense handy how - to advice on *PRO* using government information for fun and profit.
Mr. Lesko figured 0 he would be flooded *-1 with entries by now.
After all, he says 0 *?*, "we've got like 15 million bureaucrats."
And in addition to the $5,000 *U*, he has promised the winner a "My Favorite Bureaucrat" plaque and offered each of two runners - up $500 *U*.
So far, though, Mr. Lesko has received only one entry.
*PRO* To make matters worse, the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat: A woman from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance who *T*-1 nominated her boss.
Mr. Lesko, who *T*-1 is making the rules as he goes, has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats.
But he says 0 he would prefer *PRO*-1 to get nominations from rank - and - file folks.
He admits that he hasn't had much luck *PRO* generating free publicity for his contest.
Newspapers, including this one, have generally ignored his news releases.
Talk show hosts quickly change the topic.
But Mr. Lesko's staff is beginning *-1 to wonder whether there isn't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest.
"Is the government not helping anybody?" asks *T*-1 Toni Murray, an assistant to Mr. Lesko.
Mr. Lesko himself isn't yet prepared *PRO* to accept that explanation.
"People hate *PRO*-1 to write," he says *T*-2.
"Maybe people don't believe 0 I want *PRO*-1 to give this money away."
Maybe Americans are just so annoyed with government that they aren't interested in *PRO* admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while.
If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something *T*-1, Mr. Lesko admits 0 *?*, "I'd get 5,000 entries."
Now there's an idea.
Financial printer Bowne & Co. said 0 it formed a business translation service, which *T*-1 will provide legal, financial and other services in most major languages, including Japanese, Chinese and Russian.
The New York Stock Exchange said 0 a seat was sold *-1 for $500,000 *U*, *PRO* unchanged from the sale Thursday.

When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions last July *T*-1, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds.
But the 5 - 4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities--especially trespassing--as on abortion rights.
The decision, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, illustrates how Supreme Court rulings often have a ripple effect *T*-3, *PRO* spreading into areas of law and policy that *T*-2 weren't part of the actual cases decided * and that *T*-4 never were contemplated *-1 by the justices.
In the Missouri case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law.
The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected * by the Constitution.
Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis said 0 the preamble was unconstitutional, *PRO*-1 citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by *PRO* changing the definition of when life begins *T*-2.
But the Supreme Court concluded that it *ICH*-1 was premature *PRO* to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life hadn't yet been used *-2 *PRO* to restrict abortion services.
The high court majority said 0 it *EXP*-1 was up to the state courts for now *PRO* to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws.
Already, local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases *PRO* to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who *T*-1 blocked access to Reproductive Health Services, an abortion clinic in St. Louis.
The protesters said 0 their actions were justified by the desire *PRO* to save the lives of unborn children.
Under a 1981 Missouri law, persons accused * of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified "as an emergency measure 0 *T*-1 to avoid an imminent public or private injury."
*PRO*-2 Relying on the preamble's statement that a fetus is an unborn child, the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying *PRO*-1 to save lives.
In another case, a protester, Ann O'Brien, was convicted *-1 of trespass before the Supreme Court's Webster ruling.
Last week, when her appeal was argued *-1 before the Missouri Court of Appeals *T*-2, her lawyer also relied on the preamble.
"The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room 0 for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs. Wade *T*-3, and I think 0 this is one of the cracks," said *T*-2 Mark Belz, a St. Louis lawyer who *T*-1 represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters.
Roe vs. Wade was the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that *T*-1 recognized a woman's right to abortion.
Mario Mandina, president of Kansas City Lawyers for Life, says that 0 if abortion foes succeed in *PRO*-1 using the preamble *PRO*-2 to escape prosecution for trespass, "This will shut down abortion in Missouri.
There's no risk to the protesters, and you can't keep an abortion clinic *PRO*-1 open if there are 3,000 people standing outside every day."
That would be an ironic result of a case in which the Supreme Court expressly stopped short of *PRO*-2 overruling Roe vs. Wade *T*-1.
In two other cases, the possible consequences of the Supreme Court ruling appear *-1 even more unintended.
In one, the lawyer for a 20 - year - old resident of Columbia, Mo., who *T*-4 was charged *-1 with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated *-2 as a 21 - year - old adult because his actual age should be calculated *-3 from conception, not from birth.
In Missouri, those caught * *PRO* drinking and driving between the ages of 16 and 21 may have their licenses revoked *-1 for one year, while those 21 or older suffer only a 30 - day suspension.
A Boone County judge rejected the motion, but Daniel Dodson, a Jefferson City lawyer, says 0 he has appealed.
And in a case filed * in federal court in August, a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who *T*-1 is in jail for theft and forgery.
This letter was inspired *-1 by David Asman's Sept. 25 editorial - page article about Fidel Castro, "Man in the Middle of Drug Trafficking."
I've organized a series of exchanges, exhibitions and other continuing projects between Cuban and American artists.
In any matters between us and the Cubans there can be no simplicity, consequently I've become familiar not only with Cuban art and artists, but also with Cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government.
Despite levels of obstruction, incompetence and ensuing frustration of mythic proportion, these projects all remain, in my mind, valuable and well worth the effort.
There is a simple reason for this: the Cuban people.
*PRO* Let me immediately put limits to whatever nostalgic notions that may intimate *T*-1.
Those "people" to whom I refer *T*-1 are not some heroic, indecipherable quantity; they are artists, critics, taxi drivers, grandmothers, even some employees of the Ministry of Culture, all of whom *T*-2 share a deep belief in the original principles of the Cuban Revolution, spelled * out in terms such as equality among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative expression, universal rights to health and livelihood, housing, etc.
In fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of art, idealism and revolution seem *-1 modest.
It is on behalf of these people, and out of my real respect for them, that I am responding to Mr. Asman's opinions of their country *T*-1.
The Ochoa trial in July, with its revelations of deeply rooted and widespread corruption, and the summary trial and execution, was extremely disturbing to everyone who *T*-1 has ever considered himself a friend of Cuba.
However, unacceptable though those occurrences may have been *T*-1, they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth.
Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel, the army and the Cuban people.
They are not interchangeable, since they are motivated *-1 *PRO*-2 to act based on their own circumstances.
It *EXP*-1 is naivete *PRO* to equate a government's policies with the will of the people (as we well know), and it *EXP*-2 is even worse folly *PRO* to merge the clearly divergent agendas of Fidel and the military and the state bureaucracy.
Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials, even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised *-1 essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime, such as *PRO* facilitating defections.
I think 0 it *EXP*-1's a little disingenuous *PRO* to be surprised that Fidel doesn't invite the U.S. State Department *PRO*-4 to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory.
We badly need *-1 to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom.
Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue *-1 to be as counterproductive as they have *?* for 30 years.
From my own point of view, given the qualities of humanity, creativity and warm spirit in which the Cuban people excel *T*-2, we deny ourselves access to things 0 we hold *T*-3 dear, and which *T*-1 seem *-4 to run in such short supply these days.
There is no rational justification for such behavior.

For Cathay Pacific Airways, the smooth ride may be ending.
The first signs of trouble came last month when the Hong Kong carrier, a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd., posted a 5% drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year *T*-1.
Securities analysts, many of whom *T*-1 scrapped their buy recommendations after *PRO*-2 seeing Cathay's interim figures, believe 0 more jolts lie ahead.
Fuel and personnel costs are rising, and tourism in and through Hong Kong remains clouded by China's turmoil since the June 4 killings in Beijing.
In addition, delivery delays for the first two of as many as 28 Boeing 747 - 400s that the carrier has ordered *T*-1 have raised costs because personnel had been hired *-2 *PRO*-3 to man the planes.
And tough competition in the air - freight market is cutting into an important sideline.
There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China's sovereignty in 1997, Cathay will be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to play second fiddle to China's often - disparaged flag carrier, Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC.
"The sense is 0 we would never be in a position *ICH*-1 again where everything works for us the way 0 it did *T*-3 before *T*-2," says *T*-4 Rod Eddington, Cathay's commercial director.
Sarah Hall, an analyst at James Capel (Far East) Ltd., says 0 there isn't much 0 Cathay can do *T*-3 about rising costs for jet fuel, Hong Kong's tight labor market, or the strengthening of the local currency, which *T*-2 is pegged *-1 to the U.S. dollar.
These factors are further complicated *-1 by the airline's push *PRO* to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one, Ms. Hall says 0 *T*-2.
Ms. Hall expects Cathay's profit to grow around 13% annually this year and next.
In 1988, it earned $2.82 billion *U* Hong Kong (US$361.5 million *U*) on revenue of HK$11.79 billion *U*.
Cathay is taking several steps *PRO*-1 to bolster business.
One step is *PRO* to beef up its fleet.
In addition to aircraft from Boeing Co., Cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 Airbus A330 - 300s.
The expansion, which *T*-1 could cost as much as US$5.7 billion *U* over the next eight years, will expand the fleet to about 43 planes by 1991, up from 30 at the end of last year, according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd.
The fuel - efficient Airbus planes will be used *-1 largely *PRO* to replace Cathay's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights, while the Boeing aircraft will be used *-2 on long - haul routes to Europe and North America.
Cathay also is moving some of its labor - intensive data - processing operations outside Hong Kong.
Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low - level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain.
Some jobs already have been moved *-1 to Australia, and there are plans *PRO* to place others in Canada.
David Bell, a spokesman for the airline, says 0 the move is partly aimed *-1 at *PRO* retaining existing staff who *T*-2 are leaving *PRO*-3 to secure foreign passports ahead of 1997.
Cathay is working *PRO*-1 to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth *PRO* visiting on its own merits, rather than just a stopover.
Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights, Cathay's other routes have retained high load factors.
Mr. Eddington regards *PRO* promoting Hong Kong as an important part of *PRO* attracting visitors from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where the number of people looking *PRO* to travel abroad has surged *T*-1.
There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private - sector participants in the Hong Kong government's plans *PRO* to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal.
Cathay officials decline *PRO*-1 to comment on the speculation.
Mr. Eddington sees alliances with other carriers--particularly Cathay's recent link with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines--as an important part of Cathay's strategy.
But he emphasizes that Cathay hasn't any interest in *PRO* swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade *T*-1.
Analysts believe 0 Cathay is approached *-1 for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis, particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers.
"We think 0 alliances are very important," Mr. Eddington says *T*-1.
"But we'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else's.
I'm not sure 0 cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother."
In a pattern 0 it aims *PRO*-2 to copy *T*-1 in several key U.S. destinations, Cathay recently announced plans *PRO*-3 to serve San Francisco by *PRO*-4 flying into American Airlines' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier.
"We'll never have a big operation in the U.S., and they'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific," Mr. Eddington says *T*-1.
"But this way, American will coordinate good extensions to Boston, New York, Chicago and Dallas.
We'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok, Singapore and Manila."
Asian traffic, which *T*-1 currently accounts for 65% of Cathay's business, is expected *-2 to continue as the carrier's mainstay.
Cathay has long stated its desire *PRO* to double its weekly flights into China to 14, and it is applying *PRO*-1 to restart long - canceled flights into Vietnam.
Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Bell, the spokesman.
While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997, such a move isn't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong.
And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London: "Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights."
He says 0 the airline is putting its faith in the Sino - British agreement on Hong Kong's return to China.
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong's airlines, which *T*-2 include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, will continue *-3 to be negotiated *-1 by Hong Kong's government.
But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing.
"My feeling is 0 {Cathay doesn't} have a hope in the long run," says *T*-3 an analyst, who *T*-2 declines *PRO*-4 to be identified *-1.
"Cathay would love *PRO*-1 to keep *-2 going, but the general sense is 0 they're going *-3 to have *-4 to do something."
Mr. Eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have *-1 to evolve and adapt to local changes, but he feels that the Sino - British agreement is firm ground 0 *PRO* to build on *T*-2 for the foreseeable future.
"We're confident that it protects our route structure," he says *?*, "and our ability *PRO* to grow and prosper.
Grand Metropolitan PLC, the United Kingdom food and beverage group that *T*-1 owns Pillsbury Inc. of the U.S., announced a reshuffling of board - level executive duties intended * to fit the company's recent expansion.
David Nash, formerly group finance director at Cadbury Schweppes PLC, will become Grand Met's first group finance director in January.
In a statement, Grand Met said 0 its recent "growth and wider geographic spread" made it *EXP*-1 necessary *PRO* to create the new position.
The company also reassigned several executive responsibilities.
David Tagg, formerly in charge of gambling operations, was appointed *-1 *PRO*-2 chief executive for retailing and property.
Peter Cawdron, group strategy development director, and Bill Shardlow, group personnel director, will become part of the board's management committee.
A former Sperry Corp. marketing executive, admitting his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal, pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges for *PRO* helping *PRO* funnel $400,000 *U* to a midlevel Navy acquisition official during the early 1980s.
Frank Lavelle, who at the time *T*-1 was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater, Fla., admitted *PRO*-2 participating in a scheme 0 *PRO* to bribe Garland Tomlin, the Navy official *T*-3.
Mr. Tomlin, who *T*-1 left the Navy in 1985, pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy, bribery and tax - evasion charges.
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985, according to documents filed * by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria, Va.
Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. *PRO*-1 to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986.
Court documents filed * by prosecutors indicate 0 Mr. Tomlin tried *PRO*-1 to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract 0 *T*-2 to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment.
Mr. Tomlin, among other things, illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended * to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition, the documents said 0 *T*-1.
Sperry ultimately was eliminated *-1 from the competition without *PRO*-2 receiving the work.
Documents filed * by prosecutors also indicate that Mr. Lavelle and his fellow conspirators requested and obtained "approval of the scheme" from more - senior Sperry officials "because the payment which {Mr .} Tomlin requested *T*-1 was so large."
Charles Gardner, a former Unisys vice president, and James Neal, a former company consultant, have admitted *PRO*-1 participating in this and other bribery schemes.
Unisys has said that all of the company officials who *T*-1 participated in improper activities have left the company.
Mr. Lavelle faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a $500,000 *U* fine.
After several years of booming business with China, foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade.
The imposition of austerity measures, starting last October, already had begun *-1 to pinch when the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June 4 and subsequent events tugged the belt *PRO*-3 far tighter *T*-2.
Foreign lending has been virtually suspended *-1 since then, *PRO*-1 choking liquidity and hobbling many projects.
And Beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies, *PRO* leaving many domestic buyers and export - oriented plants *PRO*-1 strapped for cash.
Givaudan Far East Ltd., a Swiss concern that *T*-1 sells chemicals to shampoo and soap factories in China, typifies the problems.
Last year's retrenchment dried up the working capital of Chinese factories.
The company's sales flattened during 1989's first half.
The June killings magnified the problems.
In Canton, Givaudan's representative office received no orders in June.
At first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions, but when no orders were logged *-1 in August and September *T*-2, manager Donald Lai became convinced that business would be bad for many months.
"Things have grown worse since June 4," Mr. Lai says *T*-1.
He predicts that sales will drop between 30% and 40% *U* from last year's $3 million *U*.
The consumer - products and light - industrial sectors are bearing the brunt of China's austerity measures, and foreign companies such as Givaudan that *T*-2 deal with those industries are being hit *-1 the hardest.
But in general, all foreign - trading companies are feeling the pinch.
"The import pie will shrink," says *T*-1 John Kamm, first vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a China trade specialist.
"On the down side, sales could fall as much as 90% for some companies; on the upper side, sales will be flat."
China's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade.
The last time that traders experienced a trough *T*-1 was during 1985 - 86, when Beijing imposed tough measures 0 *PRO* to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange *T*-3 *T*-2.
The current trough is expected *-1 to be much deeper, because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time *PRO* to slow inflation.
In addition, the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the June killings have been a big setback.
"The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading," says *T*-1 Raymond Wong, China manager for Mannesmann AG, a West German machinery - trading company.
Import growth from the year - earlier months slowed to 16% in July and 7.1% in August, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.
In the first eight months of 1989, imports grew 21%, to $38.32 billion *U*, down slightly from a growth rate of 23% a year earlier.
The picture for China's exports is just as bleak, mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze.
Exports in the first eight months grew only 9%, to $31.48 billion *U*, compared with a growth rate of 25% a year earlier, according to Chinese customs figures.
The threat to China's balance of payments is further aggravated *-1 by the plunge in its foreign - exchange reserves, excluding gold holdings.
The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years, to $14 billion *U* in June from $19 billion *U* in April.
The trend has prompted Beijing *PRO*-1 to intensify efforts *PRO* to curb imports.
In recent weeks, China's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities.
The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade set up a special bureau last month *PRO*-1 to monitor the issue of import and export licenses.
Beijing's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way 0 *PRO* to get through the drought *T*-1 is by *PRO* helping China *PRO*-2 export.
For example, Nissho Iwai Corp., one of the biggest Japanese trading houses, now buys almost twice as many goods from China as it sells to that country.
Three years ago, the ratio was reversed.
But the strategy isn't helping much this time.
"Both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad," says *T*-1 Masahiko Kitamura, general manager of Nissho Iwai's Canton office.
He expects the company's trading business to drop as much as 40% *U* this year.
For a short time after June 4, it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright.
Many foreign trading offices in Hong Kong were swamped *-1 with telexes and telephone calls from Chinese trade officials urging them not *PRO*-2 to sever ties.
Even the Bank of China, which *T*-1 normally took weeks *PRO*-3 to process letters of credit, was settling the letters at record speed *PRO*-2 to dispel rumors about the bank's financial health.
But when foreign traders tried *PRO*-2 to do business *T*-1, they discovered that the eagerness of Chinese trade officials was just a smokescreen.
The suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of China's national trading companies, which *T*-1 are among the country's biggest importers.
Business isn't any better on the provincial or municipal level, foreign traders say 0 *T*-1.
Shanghai Investment & Trust Co., known * as Sitco, is the city's main financier for trading business.
Sitco had customarily tapped the Japanese bond market for funds, but it can't do that any longer.
Foreign traders say 0 the company is strapped for cash.
"It has difficulties *PRO*-3 paying its foreign debts," says *T*-2 a Hong Kong executive who *T*-1 is familiar with Sitco's business.
"How can it make available funds for purchases *T*-1?"
Foreign traders also say 0 many of China's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit.
Albert Lee, a veteran trader who *T*-2 specializes in machinery sales, estimates that as many as 70% of projects that *T*-3 had obtained approval *PRO* to proceed have been canceled *-1 in recent months.
"There are virtually no new projects, and that means no new business for us," he says 0 *T*-1.
Even when new lending resumes *T*-3, foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try *PRO*-2 to rein in foreign borrowing, which *T*-1 has grown between 30% and 40% *U* in the past few years.
And foreign creditors are likely *-1 to be more cautious about *PRO*-3 extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start *-2 falling due in the next two to five years.
Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products *PRO* to include steel, chemical fertilizers and plastics.
These have been among the country's leading imports, particularly last year when there were shortages that *T*-1 led many traders *PRO*-3 to buy heavily and pay dearly *T*-2.
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices.
*PRO*-2 To stem speculation, Beijing imposed ceiling prices that *T*-1 went into effect earlier this year.
Traders who *T*-1 had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling don't want *PRO*-2 to take a loss on resales and are holding onto their stock.
The resulting stockpiling has depressed the market.
But Beijing can't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without *PRO*-1 hampering the country's export business.
Mr. Kamm, the China trade expert, estimates that as much as 50% of Guangdong's exports is made *-1 up of processed imported raw materials.
High - definition television promises *PRO*-1 to be the TV of tomorrow, so it is a natural multibillion - dollar market.
Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan, not everyone here is ready *PRO*-1 to give up.
A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling *PRO*-2 to develop the technology 0 *T*-3 to build the screens for the thin, high - quality televisions that *T*-1 are expected *-4 to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s.
With only small help from the government, these start - up concerns are trying *PRO*-2 to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry, which *T*-1 enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government.
Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood, Ohio, aims *PRO*-2 to use a new form of plasma technology *PRO*-3 to put movie - quality images on a TV display that *T*-1 is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick.
Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., the largest of these firms, with $20 million *U* in annual revenue, has similar plans.
It already has had success in electroluminescence, another promising technology adaptable for high - definition television.
Two other firms, Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy, Mich., and Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh are developing a variation of the flat - panel screens called * *PRO*-1 active - matrix liquid crystal displays.
The new technologies are intended *-2 to retire the cathode - ray tube, which *T*-1 accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set.
*PRO* Replacing the cathode - ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high - definition television, or HDTV, which *T*-1 is expected *-2 to become a $30 billion *U* business world - wide within a decade.
Large U.S. companies are interested in other segments of the HDTV business, such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment.
But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., which *T*-1 is collaborating with Toshiba on computer displays, they are poorly positioned *PRO*-2 to exploit advances in large panels.
General Electric Co. recently sold off its interests in liquid - crystal displays to Thompson - CSF of France.
"We found the market not developing as we thought 0 it would *?*," a GE spokesman says *T*-1.
The small U.S. firms are persisting because of their strong positions in patents, and because the prize is still there *PRO* to be seized *-1.
"No one yet has shown the ability *PRO* to manufacture these panels" at commercial costs, says 0 *T*-1 Zvi Yaniv, the president of Ovonic Imaging.
He says 0 he thinks 0 his company is just a few years from *PRO*-1 doing that.
The Bush administration, hearing conflicting advice about what its role in HDTV should be *T*-1, isn't doing much for now.
The only material support 0 it is extending *T*-1 to the struggling U.S. industry is $30 million *U* in awards from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The DARPA funds are a pittance compared with what Japan and other prospective competitors are spending *T*-1.
The Commerce Department estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $1 billion *U*.
"Unless it gets more help, the U.S. industry won't have a chance," says *T*-1 Peter Friedman, Photonics's executive vice president.
Thus far, almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from U.S. laboratories.
But Peter Brody, Magnascreen's president, says 0 Japanese companies are poised *PRO*-1 to snatch the technology and put it to commercial use, just as they did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording.
In the 1970s, Mr. Brody helped *PRO* develop the first display panels based * on active - matrix liquid crystals at Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s research labs in Pittsburgh.
The panels are like oversized semiconductors surfaced * with a million or more picture elements, each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image.
In 1979, however, Westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television.
Mr. Brody left the company *PRO*-1 to find other backers.
He has a claim to the right *PRO* to commercialize the Westinghouse patents, but he contends that those patents are being infringed *-1 by a number of Japanese producers.
"Most American investors have just given up," Mr. Brody says *T*-1.
"They aren't prepared *PRO*-1 to compete in an area where the Japanese want *PRO*-3 to enter *T*-2."
Many critics question the industry's need for federal support; the Pentagon justifies its help on national - security grounds.
"We don't see a domestic source for some of our {HDTV} requirements, and that's a source of concern," says *T*-1 Michael Kelly, director of DARPA's defense manufacturing office.
So DARPA is trying *PRO*-1 to keep the industry *PRO*-2 interested in *PRO* developing large display panels by *PRO*-1 doling out research funds.
HDTV already has some military applications, such as *PRO* creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders.
The Navy is ordering displays for its Aegis cruisers and the Army wants smaller versions for its Abrams battle tanks.
The Commerce Department also is trying *PRO*-2 to encourage HDTV because of the benefits that *T*-1 could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries.
"It isn't just yuppie television," argues *T*-1 Jack Clifford, director of the department's office of microelectronics and instrumentation.
"The industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market."
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid, such as antitrust relief for research consortia, the small firms simply would prefer more DARPA funds.
Each claims *PRO*-1 to possess the right technology and wants just a bit more money *PRO*-1 to make it commercial.
They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department's concern over their future.
They all are strongly opposed to a petition *ICH*-2 from several Japanese TV manufacturers, including Matsushita, Hitachi, and Toshiba, *PRO* to exempt portable color TVs with liquid - crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes *T*-1 on the larger Japanese color TVs.
And they want the U.S. to help them *PRO*-1 sell overseas.
Planar President James Hurd says 0 he has *-1 to pay tariffs as high as 15% *PRO*-1 to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea, while panels from those countries enter the U.S. *PRO*-2 duty - free.
"This isn't a technology issue, but an attitude issue," he says *T*-1.
"We just haven't learned what it takes *T*-1 *PRO* to compete.

This business trust company said 0 its board elected Kieran E. Burke, a consultant to Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., as chief executive officer, a new post, and as president.
Mr. Burke succeeds Richard D. Manley, who *T*-1 will remain as a consultant to the company.
Both men were unavailable *PRO*-1 to comment.
The company also named Michael E. Gellert, a director and a major shareholder, *PRO*-1 to fill the vacant seat of chairman.
Investors bailed out of New York City bonds in droves last week, *PRO* driving prices lower and boosting yields.
One bond trader estimated that more than $50 million *U* of New York City general obligation bonds were put *-1 up for sale Friday alone.
While that represents a small percentage of the city's public debt outstanding, Friday's selling followed a weeklong effort *PRO* to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors.
"I've never seen so many {New York City} G.O.'s up for sale," said *T*-1 another trader.
"Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity."
Municipal bond analysts said 0 the sell - off was triggered *-1 by concerns about the city's financial health, rumors of a $900 million *U* bond offering coming soon, and political uncertainty.
A spokesman for the city wouldn't confirm the size of the bond issue, but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks, before the November mayoral election.
(General obligation bonds are backed *-1 by the city's overall revenues and credit.)
Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled *-1, many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold *-3.
The fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted *-1 as a sign that New York's budgetary problems are more serious than *PRO* had been expected *-2.
New York, one of the nation's largest issuers of tax - exempt bonds, sold $750 million *U* of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago.
There have been reports *ICH*-1 for months that the city's economy is weakening, as the October 1987 stock market crash continues *-2 to make itself felt *-3.
The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns.
Meanwhile, tax revenues are falling while the city's spending needs are expanding.
Rumors persisted last week that New York's credit ratings--single - A from Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single - A - minus from Standard & Poor's Corp.--are at risk.
The weakness in New York City bonds follows a warning from New York state Comptroller Edward Regan that the 1987 crash seriously weakened the city's economy.
In a study, the comptroller said, "The city's glory days are over."
Mr. Regan warned mayoral candidates "*PRO*-2 to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases 0 *T*-1 to address the city's problems in the next few years, due to the now - evident weakening in the New York City economy."
New York City's revised financial plan, due out later this month, is expected *-1 to include measures 0 *T*-2 to balance the city's $27 billion *U* budget.
At present, analysts project a budget gap on the order of $500 million to $600 million *U* for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1990, although the city's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit.
Mark Page, New York's deputy director of finance, said that investors' concerns about the city's financial health are "unwarranted given our proven ability *PRO* to manage ourselves."
He charges the city's critics with *PRO* spreading "unfounded emotional rhetoric."
There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage the city through what *T*-1 could become a financial crisis.
The leading contender for the mayoral office, Democrat David Dinkins, has been criticized *-1 recently for the way 0 he handled his personal financial affairs *T*-2.
And the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election.
Until last week, Mr. Dinkins was considered *-1 a shoo - in.
"The market can adjust to good news or bad news, but uncertainty drives people *PRO*-3 wild," said *T*-2 Bernard B. Beal, chief executive of M.R. Beal & Co., a securities firm that *T*-1 specializes in the municipal market.
Until last week, "Everyone felt certain 0 they knew the outcome of the election.
Now, there have been a number of questions raised *."
Last week, yields on long - term New York City general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point.
New York City's 6% bonds due 2018, for example, were quoted *-1 late Friday at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.80%, compared with 7.60% Thursday.
As the yield on New York general obligation bonds rose, the Bond Buyer 20 - bond general obligation index, the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax - exempt market, held steady at 7.19% in the week ended Oct. 19.
With the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in Panama, one of the many lingering questions 0 the Bush administration will ponder *T*-1 is this: Is the National Security Council staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, *PRO* to do its job of *PRO* coordinating foreign policy?
President Bush's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, came into office in January *PRO*-1 intent on *PRO*-1 making the NSC staff leaner and more disciplined than it had been *?* during the Reagan administration.
Gen. Scowcroft was a member of the Tower Commission, which *T*-1 investigated the Iran - Contra affair.
He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan's second term *T*-1.
So, *PRO*-3 following both the style 0 he pursued *T*-2 as President Ford's national security adviser and the recommendations of the Tower Commission, Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried *PRO*-3 to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks--namely, *PRO* gathering the views of the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in *PRO* distilling that information for the president and then making sure 0 presidential decisions are carried *-1 out.
The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be "small" and warned against *PRO* letting "energetic self - starters" like Lt. Col. Oliver North strike out on their own rather than leaving the day - to - day execution of policies to the State Department, Pentagon or Central Intelligence Agency.
However, the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big, diverse and powerful *PRO* to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues.
During the coup attempt and its aftermath, NSC staffers were "stretched *-1 very thin," says *T*-2 one senior administration official.
"It's a very small shop."
Gen. Scowcroft doesn't plan *PRO*-1 to increase the staff right now, but is weighing that possibility, the official adds 0 *T*-2.
The NSC staff "doesn't have the horsepower that I believe 0 *T*-2 is required *-4 *PRO* to have an effective interagency process," says *T*-3 Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon aide who now *T*-1 runs the Center for Security Policy, a conservative Washington think - tank.
"The problem with this administration, I think 0 *?*, is that by design it has greatly diminished, both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense, the role of the NSC."
The National Security Council itself was established *-1 in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the White House 0 *T*-2 to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies.
By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.
In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members.
But the size, shape and role of the NSC staff have been left *-1 for each president and his national security adviser to decide.
That task is one of Washington's perennial problems.
In the Bush White House, the size of the NSC's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say 0 *T*-1.
Administration officials insist that the size of the staff wasn't a problem during the Panama crisis.
But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America, Everett Briggs, was gone.
He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff.
Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert Gates, are experts in U.S. - Soviet affairs.
Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well - versed in arms control, and Mr. Gates has spent years *PRO*-1 studying Soviet politics and society.
Both have become confidants of President Bush.
But neither has an extensive background in Latin America, the Middle East or Asia.
In those areas, the role of NSC staffers under them therefore have become more important.
Gen. Scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers 0 he faces *T*-3 is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy - making and operational tasks that *T*-2 are best left *-1 to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus.
But just as every previous NSC adviser has, Gen. Scowcroft now will have *-1 to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained *T*-2.
Ducks.
If the White House spots one, it intends *PRO*-1 to fire a veto at it.
Ducks are this season's word for new taxes, under OMB Director Richard Darman's formulation that "if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
George Bush is quite clear: No new ducks.
But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over Washington?
We see a whole flock of programs that *T*-1 will impose significant costs on the American economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities.
Federal child care (quack).
The Clean Air bill (quack).
The disabled - workers bill (quack, quack).
The Bush White House is breeding non-duck ducks the same way 0 the Nixon White House did *T*-2: It hops on an issue that *T*-1 is unopposable--cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled, better child care.
It comes up with a toned - down version of a Democratic proposal.
The bill gets signed *-3 into law and then the administration watches helplessly, *PRO*-1 wondering where all the "unexpected" costs came from *T*-2.
*PRO* Consider, for instance, the very fat fowl known * as federalized child care.
The President came up with a good bill, but now may end up *PRO*-1 signing the awful bureaucratic creature hatched * on Capitol Hill.
It would create 38,000 local day - care commissions, answerable to the Department of Health and Human Services.
They'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day *T*-1, and they'd regulate the storage facilities.
The initial costs are said *-1 to be in the $2 billion *U* a year range, but that's only the beginning.
New entitlements tend *-1 to grow, *PRO* creating a rationale for new taxes.
Quack.
The administration claims that its Clean Air bill will cost businesses between $14 billion and $19 billion *U* annually, but economist Michael Evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $60 billion *U* a year range.
The House bill also distorts economic efficiency in all sorts of perverse ways.
For example, the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants.
So instead of *PRO*-1 building more efficient modern plants, utilities stick scrubbers on the old plants.
The money spent * on scrubbers is diverted *-1 from planned research on new, cleaner technology.
The bill also imposes the California auto - emissions standards on all cars nationwide, as if a car registered * in Big Sky, Montana, needed *-1 to be as clean as one driven * in Los Angeles.
Proponents of the nationwide standards say 0 the cost for car buyers would be about $500 *U* per car.
Other analysts say 0 that estimate is low.
Quack.
Nobody knows how many billions of dollars the Americans With Disabilities Act will cost *T*-1, because nobody knows what the bill entails *T*-2.
It is an intentionally vague document that *T*-1 will create a wave of litigation.
Judges will write the real bill as suits roll through the courts.
Lawyers will benefit.
Private companies, and ultimately their customers, will end up *PRO*-1 footing the huge bill.
The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged * up with regulations and distortions.
All this was recognized and documented *-1 in the succeeding years by economists, some of whom *T*-2 worked in the Reagan administration *PRO*-3 to lift this burden from the American people, states and local governments.
*PRO*-1 Running for President in 1980 and 1988, George Bush also persuasively diagnosed the economic stagnation of the 1970s.
In fact, during last year's campaign, the entire nation constantly heard Mr. Bush tout his accomplishments as head of the Task Force on Regulatory Relief.
"Government continues *-1 to inhibit the productivity of our citizenry and the international competitiveness of American business," the vice president declared *T*-3 when he was head of the task force *T*-2.
But with the impending passage of these new programs, Mr. Bush will surely be sending many people *PRO*-3 hurtling back into the regulatory thicket that he had helped *PRO* cut *T*-1 back.
By 1986, the number of federal regulators was down to about 103,000.
Then it turned up, and by one estimate the number will be up to about 109,000 regulators by next year.
*PRO* Holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the Bush presidency.
We would have thought by now, though, that there was a significant core of people involved * in government life who *T*-1 understood that direct taxation isn't the only way 0 *PRO* to slow down an economy *T*-2.
It is merely the most obvious.
What *T*-1 is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that well - intentioned public programs often backfire.
But while they are unloading these burdens, the United States is close to *PRO* creating three more big ones.
The Bush administration ought *-1 to be setting aside some of its buckshot for the non-duck ducks.
The Bakersfield Supermarket went out of business last May.
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs.
Nor was there a shortage of customers in the area, the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan.
The business closed when the owner was murdered *-1 by robbers *T*-2.
The owner was Israel Ortiz, a 29 - year - old entrepreneur and father of two.
In his first year of *PRO* operating the store 0 he bought *T*-2 for $220,000 *U*, Mr. Ortiz was robbed *-1 at least twice at gunpoint.
The first time he was shot *-1 in the hand as he chased the robbers outside.
The second time he identified two robbers, who *T*-1 were arrested and charged.
Two weeks later--perhaps in retaliation--Mr. Ortiz was shot *-1 three times in the back, during what police classified *T*-2 as a third robbery attempt.
That was his reward for *PRO* working until 11 p.m. seven days a week *PRO*-1 to cover his $3,000 *U* a month rent.
For *PRO* providing what his customers described *T*-1 as very personal and helpful service.
For *PRO* creating a focus for neighborhood life.
Israel Ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who *T*-1 will be injured or killed *-2 by crime this year.
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2% of all retail - sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year, almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers, truck drivers, medical workers and door - to - door salespeople.
Only a few other occupations *ICH*-1 have higher reported rates of criminal injury, such as police, bartenders and taxi drivers.
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem.
Recent data from New York City provide more of the picture.
While by no means the highest crime community in the country, New York is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small - business development *T*-1.
A survey of small businesses there was conducted *-1 this spring by Interface, a policy research organization.
It gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses.
The survey found that over a three - year period 22% of the firms said 0 employees or owners had been robbed *-1 on their way to or from work or while on the job.
Seventeen percent reported their customers being robbed *-1.
Crime was the reason that 26% reported difficulty *PRO* recruiting personnel and that 19% said 0 they were considering moving.
More than one - third of the responding businesses said 0 they suffer from drug dealing and loitering near their premises.
In Brooklyn and the Bronx, one out of four commercial firms is burglarized *-1 each year.
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse, with burglary rates twice the citywide average.
Crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses.
Two decades ago, the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof. Albert Reiss's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn * from national IRS records.
He found that monetary crime losses, as a proportion of gross receipts, were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones.
The New York study's companies averaged 27 employees; their annual crime losses averaged about $15,000 *U*, with an additional $8,385 *U* annual cost in security--enough money *PRO* to hire at least one more worker.
The costs of crime may also be enough *PRO* to destroy a struggling business.
Whatever the monetary crime losses, they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury.
After repeated gun robberies, some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives.
One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that *T*-1 included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises.
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that National Institute of Justice Director James K. Stewart calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 "crime causing poverty."
Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities, *PRO* contributing to the poverty of local residents.
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs, if crime were not so harmful to *PRO* creating and maintaining those businesses.
This may help *PRO* explain why small businesses create 65% of all jobs nationally, but only 22% of jobs in a crime - ridden city like New York *T*-2.
Bigger business can often better afford *PRO*-1 to minimize the cost of crime.
The New York study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $1,000 *U* per worker, compared with one - third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees.
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for *PRO* providing low - crime business environments.
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass *PRO*-1 to regulate access to these quasi-public places.
Since 1984, in fact, revenues of the 10 largest guard companies, primarily serving such big businesses, have increased by almost 62%.
Few small neighborhood businesses, however, can afford such protection, even in collaboration with other local merchants.
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates, small business generally relies on the public police force for protection.
This creates several problems.
One is that there are not enough police *PRO* to satisfy small businesses.
The number one proposal for *PRO* reducing crime in the New York survey was *PRO* to put more police on foot or scooter patrol, *PRO* suggested by more than two - thirds of the respondents.
Only 22% supported private security patrols funded * by the merchants themselves.
A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms, which *T*-1 can make urban police less than enthusiastic about *PRO* responding to calls from small businesses.
Only half the New York small businesses surveyed *, for their part, are satisfied with the police response 0 they receive *T*-1.
Some cities, including New York, have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that *T*-1 provide additional patrols funded * by local businesses.
But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship.
Another solution 0 cities might consider *T*-1 is *PRO* giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas.
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers, it *EXP*-1 may be a wise business investment *PRO* to help *PRO* keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits.
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such "hot spots" of pedestrian density.
With National Institute of Justice support, the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy, *PRO*-1 comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols.
Small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to testify against a robbery suspect *T*-1.
While no guarantee, an increased police presence might even deter further attacks.
It might even have saved the life, and business, of Israel Ortiz.
Mr. Sherman is a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland and president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington, D.C.
The Better Business Bureau of San Diego and the state Attorney General's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau - sponsored business directories published * by an outside firm, Better Book Inc.
The settlement stems from charges that Better Book, now defunct, made misrepresentations in *PRO* selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau from 1984 to 1986.
Without *PRO*-1 admitting any guilt, the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm *PRO* to publish its directories.
The conditions include *PRO* not misrepresenting how many directories *T*-3 will be distributed *-1, and agreeing *PRO*-4 to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved *-2 in the sale.
The Attorney General's investigation was sparked *-1 by lawsuits and charges *ICH*-3 by angry California businesspeople that they were swindled *-2 in a bureau - sponsored directory project contracted * by Better Book.
The uproar led to the closing of the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau in late 1987.
Britain's Serious Fraud Office said 0 it will investigate the circumstances surrounding alleged phantom contracts at Ferranti International Signal PLC's International Signal & Control unit.
The investigation, which *T*-2 will be coordinated *-1 with one already under way in the U.S., follows the discovery of what Ferranti has called *T*-3 *PRO*-4 a "serious" fraud involving its U.S. subsidiary.
International Signal & Control, Lancaster, Pa., a defense - equipment manufacturer, was bought *-1 by Ferranti in 1987 for #420 million *U* ($670.3 million *U*).
Ferranti has said that it would be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to write off #185 million *U* against the phantom contracts, *PRO* reducing its net asset value by more than half.
The Serious Fraud Office, a division of London's Metropolitan Police responsible for *PRO* investigating financial crimes, said 0 its work would take in "allegations of fraud prior to *RNR*-1, surrounding *RNR*-1 and subsequent to *RNR*-1 the merger."
Ferranti said that it welcomes the investigation and that it will "cooperate fully."
Derek Alun - Jones, Ferranti's chairman, has said 0 he hoped *PRO*-1 to pursue legal action against those responsible.
The British defense electronics group has said 0 it will sell #100 million *U* in assets and may seek a merger *PRO*-1 to strengthen itself in the wake of its troubles.
The Office of Thrift Supervision banned B.J. Garman, a former director of the failed Vision Banc Savings Association of Kingsville, Texas, from *PRO*-1 working in any financial institution insured * by the government.
The office, a Treasury Department unit that *T*-2 is the successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said 0 this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year's thrift - bailout legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made *-1 public.
Generally, regulators haven't announced enforcement actions in the past.
Indeed, the OTS said that before the law took effect Aug. 9, it banned another "key Vision Banc insider" from insured financial institutions.
That individual wasn't identified *-1.
Vision Banc was placed *-1 in government conservatorship in March, and it operates under the control of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created *PRO* to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts.
The OTS didn't say specifically why the action was taken *-1 against Ms. Garman *T*-2.
However, it said 0 examiners found a variety of insider dealings at the thrift, including "extraordinary loan commissions" paid * to a firm associated * with Vision Banc officials, and loans diverted * through borrowers back to the thrift officials.
Ms. Garman couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
In a blow to France's Rafale jet fighter, the French navy for the first time publicly stated its desire *PRO* to buy 15 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F - 18 Hornets *PRO*-1 to defend its aircraft carriers.
The statement is likely *-3 to sharpen the debate within France's military establishment over the Rafale, which *T*-2 is made *-1 by Avions Marcel Dassault - Breguet Aviation SA.
In an interview in the navy's official weekly magazine Cols Bleus, the navy's second - in - command, Adm. Yves Goupil, said 0 the navy still intends *PRO*-1 to buy 86 Rafales as *PRO* scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century.
The air force is *-1 to take at least 250 more.
Adm. Goupil said 0 the navy can't wait until 1998, when the naval Rafale becomes available *T*-1, *PRO*-2 to replace its obsolete fleet of American - made Crusaders, used * since the 1950s *PRO* to protect carriers from attack.
Rather than *PRO*-4 renovate the Crusaders, which Dassault is proposing *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 for around 1.8 billion French francs ($286.6 million *U*), Adm. Goupil said 0 the navy wants *PRO*-3 to buy used F - 18s from the U.S. Navy.
Officially, the statement isn't an attack on the Rafale.
Adm. Goupil said that when the F - 18s wear out *T*-1, the navy is prepared *PRO*-2 to take Rafales *PRO* to replace them.
But unofficially, senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill - suited to carrier use.
Although they never said so publicly, they have made no secret of their preference for the F - 18 on operational grounds.
Adm. Goupil's comments are likely *-1 to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault.
Although *PRO*-1 government - controlled, Dassault still is run *-1 by the founder's son, Chairman Serge Dassault, who *T*-2 has fiercely protected his company's independence.
The Rafale project is the result of France's inability jointly *PRO* to develop a plane with other countries, and French officials question whether the state can continue *-1 paying for expensive independent programs.
So far, Mr. Dassault has resisted pressure *PRO*-1 to change.
What *T*-1 brought the naval issue to a head is that the Crusaders are literally falling apart, without any immediate plan *PRO* to replace them.
Adm. Goupil, a former Crusader squadron leader, said that the last other country 0 *T*-1 to use Crusaders, the Philippines, retired its last ones two years ago.
A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here.
Adm. Goupil rejected Dassault's proposal *PRO* to renovate the Crusaders, *PRO*-2 saying 0 the cost was impossible 0 *PRO* to estimate *T*-1.
*PRO*-2 Even modernized, he said *?*, the Crusaders represent an obsolete and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers 0 France has sent *T*-1 to meet such crises as the wars in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf.
Defense Minister Jean - Pierre Chevenement told a meeting of the Anglo - American Press Association that the question of *PRO* modernizing the Crusaders or buying used F18s is a "political" decision that he will make *T*-1 in due time.
Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again.
As the government prepares *PRO*-1 to release the next batch of economic reports, the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative.
And that, they say *?*, will be good for bonds.
"Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity," said *T*-1 Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities.
Mr. Platt is advising clients that "the near - term direction of bond prices is likely *-1 to remain upward."
Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market, which *T*-1 provided a temporary boost for bonds during the Oct. 13 stock market plunge, bond prices will start *-2 to climb on the prospects that the Federal Reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks.
That would be comforting to fixed - income investors, many of whom *T*-1 were badly burned in the third quarter by *PRO*-2 incorrectly assuming that the Fed would ease.
Investors rushed *PRO*-1 to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue *-2 to fall.
But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the Fed's credit - easing policy was on hold *T*-1, bond yields jumped and prices tumbled.
Long - term bonds have performed erratically this year.
For example, a group of long - term Treasury bonds tracked * by Merrill Lynch & Co. produced a total return of 1% in the first quarter, 12.45% in the second quarter and -0.06% in the third quarter.
Total return is price changes plus interest income.
Now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy, and they are urging clients *PRO*-1 to buy bonds before the rally begins.
Among other things, economists note that consumer spending is slowing, corporate profit margins are being squeezed *-1, business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed.
At the same time, last week's consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating.
*PRO* Add it all up and it means "that the Fed has a little leeway 0 *PRO* to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of *PRO* rekindling inflation *T*-1," said 0 *T*-2 Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh.
"I think 0 we will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1/2% in the next two weeks and 8% by year end."
The federal funds rate, which banks *T*-2 charge each other on overnight loans, is considered *-1 an early signal of changes in the Fed's credit policy.
Economists generally agree that the rate was lowered *-1 by the Fed from around 9%, where it had been since July *T*-2, to about 8 3/4% in early October on the heels of a weak employment report.
Although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell - off that *T*-1 occurred Oct. 13, it ended Friday at about 8 11/16%.
James Kochan, chief fixed - income strategist at Merrill Lynch, is touting shorter - term securities, which he says 0 *T*-1 should benefit more quickly than longer - term bonds as interest rates fall.
"Given our forecast for lower rates, purchases made * now should prove *-2 quite rewarding before year end," he said *T*-1.
Mr. Kochan also likes long - term, investment - grade corporate bonds and long - term Treasurys.
He says 0 these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors, reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high - yield junk bond markets, seek safer securities.
"If the {Tennessee Valley Authority} sale is any guide, there appears *-1 to be good demand for top - quality, long - term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts," he said *T*-2.
TVA, in its first public debt offering in 15 years, sold $4 billion *U* of long - term and intermediate - term securities last week.
Strong investor demand prompted the utility *PRO*-1 to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion *U*.
TVA, which *T*-1 operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation owned * by the federal government.
But *PRO* persuading investors *PRO*-2 to buy bonds may be especially tough this week, when the U.S. government will auction more than $30 billion *U* of new securities *T*-1.
Today, the Treasury Department will sell $15.6 billion *U* of three - month and six - month bills at the regular weekly auction.
Tomorrow, the Treasury will sell $10 billion *U* of two - year notes.
Resolution Funding Corp., known * as Refcorp, a division of a new government agency created *PRO* to bail out the nation's troubled savings and loan associations, will hold its first bond auction Wednesday, when it will sell $4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds *T*-1.
All of this comes ahead of the government's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt, which *T*-1 takes place sometime in November.
So far, investors haven't shown much appetite for Refcorp's initial bond offering.
Roger Early, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp., said that yields on the so - called bailout bonds aren't high enough *PRO* to attract his attention.
"Why should I bother with something that *T*-1's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield *T*-3?" he said *T*-2.
"I'm not going *-1 to jump on them the first day 0 they come out *T*-2."
He seems *-1 to be typical of many professional money managers.
When the size of the Refcorp offering was announced *-1 last week and when - issued trading activity began *T*-2, the bailout bonds were yielding about 1/20 percentage point more than the Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond.
On Friday, the yield was quoted *-1 at about 1/4 percentage point higher than the benchmark bond, an indication of weak demand.
Some economists believe that yields on all Treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles *PRO*-1 to absorb the new supply.
But once the new securities are digested *-1, they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data.
"The supply is not a constraint to the market," said *T*-1 Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc.
"If one thinks that rates are going down, you don't care how much supply *T*-1 is coming."
Friday's Market Activity
Most bond prices fell on concerns about this week's new supply and disappointment that stock prices didn't stage a sharp decline.
Junk bond prices moved higher, however.
In early trading, Treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue.
Also *PRO* providing support to Treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock - index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks.
Those hopes were dashed *-1 when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance *T*-2.
Treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as 1/4 point, or about $2.50 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The benchmark 30 - year bond, which *T*-1 traded as high as 102 1/4 during the day, ended at 101 17/32.
The yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.98% from 7.96%.
In the corporate bond market, traders said 0 the new - issue market for junk bonds is likely *-1 to pick up following Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp.'s $475 million *U* junk bond offering Friday.
Today, for example, underwriters at Morgan Stanley & Co. said 0 they expect *PRO*-1 to price a $150 million *U*, 12 - year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc.
Traders expect the issue to be priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield 12%.
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $150 million *U* senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected *-1 by the end of the month.
However, despite the big new - issue calendar, many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical 0 the deals will get done *-1.
"There are about a dozen more deals coming," said *T*-1 Michael McNamara, director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc.
"If they had this much trouble with Chicago & North Western, they are going *-1 to have an awful time with the rest."
Last week, underwriters were forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market.
And pressure by big investors forced Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. *PRO*-1 to sweeten Chicago & North Western's $475 million *U* junk bond offering.
After hours of negotiating that *T*-3 stretched late into Thursday night, underwriters priced the 12 - year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures at par *PRO*-4 to yield 14.75%, higher than the 14.5% that *T*-2 had been expected *-1.
The coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that *T*-1 will give the issue a market value of 101.
However, the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset *T*-1 is 15.50%.
Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10% of the common stock in Chicago & North Western's parent company.
"The coupon was raised *-2 *PRO*-3 to induce some of the big players on the fence *PRO*-4 to come in," said *T*-1 a spokesman for Donaldson.
"We put a price *ICH*-1 on the deal that the market required *T*-2 to get it done."
The spokesman said 0 the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad, particularly from Japanese investors.
In the secondary, or resale, market, junk bonds closed 1/2 point higher, while investment - grade corporate bonds fell 1/8 to 1/4 point.

Wisconsin Toy Co. said 0 it definitively agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire closely held Everything's a Dollar Inc. of Virginia Beach, Va., for stock currently valued at about $4.7 million *U*.
The Milwaukee toy retailer said 0 the agreement calls for Everything's a Dollar holders to receive for their holdings a total of 354,600 newly issued Wisconsin Toy shares.
Wisconsin Toy currently has about 4.7 million shares outstanding.
A company official said 0 Arthur Borie, until January chief operating officer of Pic 'N Save Inc., will buy a 20% stake in the new Wisconsin Toy subsidiary, and will act as head of Everything's a Dollar.
Wisconsin Toy has 71 retail stores, primarily in discount settings.
Everything's a Dollar operates 60 specialty - retail stores.
In terms of sheer brutality, the Somali regime of Siad Barre may rank as No. 1 in the world.
The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread * out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas.
The Barre dictatorship simply is limited in the amount of people 0 it can torture and kill *T*-1.
*PRO* Beheading small children, stabbing elderly people to death, raping and shooting women, and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that the Somali armed forces have been engaged *-2 in *T*-3 over the past two years.
Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre's troops.
In the port of Berbera, for example, hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded *-2 up in May 1988, imprisoned *-2, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men *PRO*-2 to be executed *-1 without any judicial process whatsoever.
Guns were never used *-1: Each man was stabbed *-2 to death with a large knife.
The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report, based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees.
The study was done *-1 by Robert Gersony, a consultant to the U.S. State Department who *T*-2 has years of experience in *PRO* investigating human - rights abuses on both sides of the left - right ideological divide.
What *T*-1 gives these events particular significance, however, is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa.
Not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for grabs as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks *?*.
Mr. Barre's rule is crumbling fast.
Mutinies wrack his armed forces (really just an armed gang), which *T*-1 control less than half the country.
Inflation is at record levels.
*PRO*-2 Desperate, he has called in the Libyans *PRO*-3 to help *PRO* fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north, which *T*-1 is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu.
*PRO*-2 Seventy years old and a self - declared "scientific socialist," President Barre has a power base, composed * only of his minority Mareham clan, that according to observers *T*-1 is "narrowing."
The U.S.'s interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera, which U.S. military aircraft have the right *PRO*-2 to use *T*-1 for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.
That strip of concrete is backed *-1 up by a few one - story, air - conditioned shacks where a handful of American nationals--buttressed * by imported food, cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated--maintain radio contact with the outside world *T*-2.
In the past two years, the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy, where, due to Mr. Barre's brutality and ineptitude, nobody is any longer in control *T*-1.
As long as the rival Soviet - backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. was forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door.
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks, those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway.
On Sept. 7, I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas.
Recently, in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia, Tigrean forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops.
(*PRO* Think what these numbers mean *T*-1--considering the headline space devoted * to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon, a small country of little strategic importance!)
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa, *PRO*-3 threatening the town of Dese, which *T*-1 would cut off Mr. Mengistu's capital from the port of Assab, through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa *T*-2.
As a result, Mr. Mengistu has been forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just *PRO* to hold the town, *PRO* thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only *PRO* to keep the Tigreans at bay.
Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position: Half his army is tied *-1 down *PRO*-1 defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans.
The weaker he gets, the more he turns toward the U.S. for help.
While the Tigreans are communists, like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world, *PRO*-1 having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet - supplied Mengistu air force.
What this all means *T*-1 in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is *?*.
The U.S., therefore, has a historic opportunity *PRO* both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip - flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa.
Back to Somalia:
The State Department, to its credit, has already begun *-2 distancing itself from Mr. Barre, *PRO* evinced * by its decision *PRO* to publish the Gersony report (which the press has ignored *T*-1).
What *T*-1's more, the U.S. has suspended $2.5 million *U* in military aid and $1 million *U* in economic aid.
But this is not enough.
Because the U.S. is still perceived *-3 to be tied *-1 to Mr. Barre, when he goes *T*-2 the runway could go too.
Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway *T*-1, the better option--both morally and strategically--would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly, in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis *PRO* to understand.
It *EXP*-2 is a certainty that Mr. Barre's days are numbered *-1.
The U.S. should take care, however, that its own position in the country does not go down with him.
Nobody is sure what *T*-1 will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be *T*-2.
But as one expert tells me: "Whoever it is *T*-1 will have *-2 to work pretty damn hard *PRO*-3 to be worse than Barre."
While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia, it should continue *-1 to back former President Carter's well - intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia, while *PRO* concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan.
Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa.
*PRO* Remember that it *EXP*-2 took Mr. Mengistu many months, in what *T*-1 became known as the "creeping coup," *PRO*-3 to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975.
There is simply no way *PRO* to engineer a succession covertly, as *PRO* is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent.
But the U.S. has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed *-1 throughout Ethiopia for what they did *T*-2 to the country this past decade--famine and all.
It's not just in Eastern Europe *ICH*-2 where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side *T*-1, but on the horn of Africa as well.
The only U.S. liability in the region is what *T*-2 remains of the link to Mr. Barre, and that should be cut *-1 fast.
Mr. Kaplan, author of "*PRO* Surrender or Starve: The Wars Behind the Famine" (Westview Press, 1988), lives in Lisbon.
A bill that *T*-1 would permit the Securities and Exchange Commission *PRO*-3 to monitor the financial condition of securities firms' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some Wall Street firms, which *T*-2 argue that the legislation is unnecessary.
The legislation and other issues related * to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee and the Senate Securities Subcommittee.
Richard Breeden, the new chairman of the SEC, hasn't taken a formal position on the bill, which *T*-1 would also require investors *PRO*-2 to disclose large trades and give the SEC additional authority during market emergencies.
However, he recently told the Senate Banking Committee that he believes 0 the agency should have explicit authority *PRO*-2 to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers, which *T*-1 are frequently used *-3 *PRO* to issue bridge loans.
The bridge loans are intended *PRO*-1 to provide temporary financing for acquisitions.
Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk, high - yield junk bonds, the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated * with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans.
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted.
In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee, First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate.
First Boston, whose holding company, CS First Boston Group, *T*-1 is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on Wall Street, said 0 it is also concerned that once the SEC has the power *PRO*-2 to monitor holding companies, it will try *PRO*-3 to regulate their activities.
"The proposal, while well - intended, I think 0 *T*-4 can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be *PRO*-3 to weaken *RNR*-1, rather than strengthen *RNR*-1 the control 0 the SEC has exercised *T*-2 for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers," Michael Raoul - Duval, managing director of First Boston, said *T*-4 in an interview.
The bill would "divert scarce resources of the commission away from broker - dealers into areas which *T*-1 simply have no way of *PRO* affecting broker - dealers," Mr. Raoul - Duval said 0 *T*-2.
Sources in the industry and on Capitol Hill say 0 a compromise that *T*-1 would placate the industry while *PRO*-2 addressing the SEC's concerns may be possible.
An aide to the Senate Securities Subcommittee says 0 some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure, but adds: "nobody is wedded *-1 to the language in the bill."
Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association, said that the securities - industry trade group opposes the bill as it is written *-1 but that it is "hopeful 0 a compromise can be reached *-2 *PRO* to achieve the SEC's goals."
Mr. O'Brien will elaborate on the SIA's position in testimony before the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee this week, a spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
President Bush wants the Pentagon to get special treatment in *PRO* coping with the across - the - board spending cuts that *T*-1 took effect last week.
Mr. Bush asked Congress *PRO*-3 to raise to $6 billion *U* from $3 billion *U* the amount of money 0 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may shift *T*-1 among the Pentagon's individual programs, projects and activities, *PRO* allowing him to ease the pain that the Gramm - Rudman budget law was intended * to inflict *T*-2.
If the request is approved *-1 by both the House and Senate, Mr. Cheney would need only permission from the White House Office of Management and Budget *PRO*-2 to move the money, according to Senate budget analysts.
That would give the Pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has *T*-1.
"It's simply a way of *PRO* making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs," said *T*-2 Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn .) of the Senate Budget Committee, who *T*-1 said 0 he would oppose the request.
"That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm - Rudman is supposed *-2 to impose *T*-1," he said *T*-3.
The president's request didn't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money *T*-1.
A Pentagon official said 0 the request was made *-1 *PRO* to give the department "maximum flexibility" 0 *T*-2 to deal with the cuts.
Last week, Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $16.1 billion *U* spending reduction, half of which *T*-1 must come from defense, *PRO*-2 to "impose a little bit more discipline" by *PRO* applying cuts to each individual program, project or activity in the budget.
That would give agencies "less ability...*PRO* to fudge over things," he told 0 *T*-1 reporters.
Under the deficit - reduction law, 4.3% of the Pentagon's money and 5.3% of other agencies' money has been canceled *-1.
Lawmakers are expected *-2 to try *PRO*-3 to restore the funds once a pending deficit - cutting measure has been signed *-1 into law.

This city is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged * by last week's earthquake.
Estimates of damage in the six - county San Francisco Bay area neared $5 billion *U*, excluding the cost of *PRO* repairing the region's transportation system.
The Bay Bridge, the main artery into San Francisco from the east, will be closed *-1 for at least several weeks.
Part of the bridge collapsed in the quake, which *T*-1 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
The bridge normally carries 250,000 commuters a day.
Also, most of the ramps connecting the city to its main link to the south, the 101 freeway, have been closed *-1 for repairs.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which *T*-2 runs subway trains beneath the bay, is braced *-1 for a doubling of its daily regular ridership to 300,000.
BART has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for the onslaught.
Most unusual will be *T*-1 water - borne commuters from the East Bay towns of Oakland and Berkeley.
For the first time in 32 years, ferry service has been restored *-1 between the East Bay and San Francisco.
The Red and White Fleet, which *T*-1 operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance *PRO* to ride the waves for the price of $10 *U* round - trip.
That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners.
"I'll stay with BART," said *T*-1 one secretary, *PRO*-2 swallowing her fears about *PRO* using the transbay tube.
Officials expect the Golden Gate Bridge to be swamped *-1 with an extra load of commuters, including East Bay residents making a long detour.
"We're anticipating quite a traffic crunch," said *T*-1 one official.
About 23,000 people typically travel over the Golden Gate Bridge during commute hours.
About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24 - hour period.
Meetings canceled * by Apple Computer Inc.'s European sales force and by other groups raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants.
It also raised hackles of the city's tourism boosters.
"Other cities are calling {groups booked * here for tours and conferences} and--not *PRO* to be crass--stealing our booking list," said *T*-1 Scott Shafer, a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos.
City officials stuck by their estimate of $2 billion *U* in damage to the quake - shocked city.
The other five Bay area counties have increased their total damage estimates to $2.8 billion *U*.
All estimates exclude highway repair, which *T*-1 could exceed $1 billion *U*.
Among the expensive unknowns are *T*-3 stretches of elevated freeway in San Francisco that *T*-2 were closed *-1 because of quake - inflicted damage.
The most worrisome stretch is 1.2 miles of waterfront highway known * as the Embarcadero Freeway.
Until it was closed *-1 Tuesday, it had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from the Bay Bridge heading into the Financial District.
Engineers say 0 it will take at least eight months *PRO* to repair the Embarcadero structure.
As part of the quake recovery effort, the city Building Department has surveyed about 3,000 buildings, including all of the Financial District's high - rises.
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of 200 downtown high - rises is that "we were incredibly lucky," said *T*-1 Lawrence Kornfield, San Francisco's chief building inspector.
While many of these buildings sustained heavy damage, little of that involved major structural damage.
City building codes require construction that *T*-1 can resist temblors.
In England, Martin Leach, a spokesman for Lloyd's of London, said 0 the insurance market hasn't yet been able *PRO*-1 to estimate the total potential claims from the disaster.
"The extent of the claims won't be known for some time," Mr. Leach said *T*-1.
On Friday, during a visit to California 0 *PRO* to survey quake damage *T*-1, President Bush promised *PRO*-2 to "meet the federal government's obligation" *PRO* to assist relief efforts.
California officials plan *PRO*-1 to ask Congress for $3 billion or more *U* of federal aid, in the form of grants and low - interest loans.
The state has a $1 billion *U* reserve, and is expected *-1 to add $1 billion *U* to that fund in the next year.
Some of that money will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid, but members of the legislature are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax 0 *T*-1 to raise money for earthquake relief.
However, state initiatives restrict the ability *ICH*-1 of the legislature *PRO* to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum.

The long - running scandal surrounding the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano was reignited *-1 by the arrest last week of Rome businessman Flavio Carboni on fraud charges.
Rome magistrates accuse Mr. Carboni and several other people of *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-1 to extort 1.2 billion lire ($880,000 *U*) from the Vatican in return for documents contained * in the briefcase of Roberto Calvi, the Ambrosiano chairman found *PRO* hanged *-3 under London's Blackfriar's Bridge shortly before the bank's collapse.
Banco Ambrosiano, which *T*-1 was Italy's largest private - sector bank, collapsed in 1982 with $1.3 billion *U* of debts.
Most of the money was lent *-3 to a series of shell companies in Panama and Luxembourg that *T*-2 were owned *-1, directly or indirectly, by the Vatican bank.
The Vatican, which *T*-1 denies any wrongdoing, paid $250 million *U* to the Milan bank's creditors as a "goodwill gesture" in 1985.
Italian news reports said 0 Mr. Carboni and a colleague obtained 1.2 billion lire in checks from a Vatican official, Pavel Hnilica.
Italian papers speculated 0 the briefcase contained papers either exonerating the Vatican bank from blame in the scandal, or showing that the bank, known * as the Istituto per le Opere di Religione, channeled funds to East bloc groups such as Solidarity in Poland.
Neither Mr. Hnilica, Mr. Carboni nor Vatican officials could be reached *-1 for comment over the weekend.
Philip Morris Cos., whose Benson & Hedges cigarette brand *T*-1 has been losing market share, has asked at least one other agency *PRO*-3 to try its hand at creative work for the big account, which *T*-2 has been at Wells Rich Greene Inc. since 1966.
Executives close to Philip Morris said that the tobacco and food giant has asked Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi Co., and possibly others *PRO*-1 to work on creative ideas for the account.
Several executives said 0 another potential contender is WPP Group's Ogilvy & Mather agency, which *T*-1 works on some other Philip Morris products.
Both Philip Morris and Backer Spielvogel declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
A spokeswoman for Ogilvy & Mather said 0 the agency doesn't comment on "idle speculation."
Also mentioned as a contender was *T*-1 TBWA Advertising, but the company denied 0 it was participating.
The loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to Wells Rich.
Benson & Hedges has been one of its most high - visibility campaigns, as well as one of its largest clients.
The account billed almost $60 million *U* last year, according to Leading National Advertisers.
But Philip Morris has scaled back ad spending on the brand over the past year, industry executives said 0 *?*, and it now bills about $30 million to $40 million *U*.
Industry executives said 0 Philip Morris had asked the other agencies *PRO*-1 to create campaigns in a bid *PRO* to stop the brand's slipping market share.
According to John Maxwell, an analyst at Wheat First Securities, Richmond, Va., Benson & Hedges has slipped from 4.7% of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1% after the second quarter of this year.
The brand is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business, Mr. Maxwell said 0 *T*-1.
The slip has come despite high - profile ads created * by Wells Rich, including one picturing a young man clad * only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch.
That ad generated so much publicity that a trade magazine launched a contest for its readers to guess who the guy was *T*-1 and what he was doing *T*-2.
Wells Rich first popularized the Benson & Hedges brand more than 20 years ago with ads portraying, among other things, an elevator door closing on a passenger's cigarette.
The brand early on achieved an upscale appeal--a trait that some analysts believe 0 *T*-1 is partly responsible for its staid performance.
Philip Morris, trying *PRO*-1 to revive the Benson & Hedges franchise, put the account up for review in 1986.
Wells Rich Greene, however, in an effort directed * by Mary Wells Lawrence, emerged the victor of the review and retained the business.
Kenneth Olshan, Wells Rich's chairman, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
While Wells Rich recently picked up Hertz Corp.'s $25 million to $30 million *U* account, it has lost a number of big accounts this year, including the $20 million to $25 million *U* Cadbury - Schweppes Canada Dry and Sunkist accounts, the $18 million *U* Procter & Gamble Co . Sure deodorant account and the $10 million *U* Polo / Ralph Lauren business.
Its victories include more than $30 million *U* in Sheraton Corp. business and an assignment from Dun & Bradstreet worth $5 million to $10 million *U*.

Malcolm, a former film - maker turned architect, has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his shady, obnoxious client, a *PRO* fly - by - night real estate developer.
Nora, who *T*-1 still has artistic aspirations, knows 0 she is lucky *PRO*-2 to be working as a food stylist, prepping pies, burgers, frosty cold drinks and other comestibles *PRO*-3 to look as appetizing as possible in front of the camera.
After all, she reasons *?*, "there were housewives with Nikons and degrees from cooking schools in France who *T*-1 would kill for her job."
But Nora and Malcolm feel trapped.
They seem *-1 to be having the "worst of both worlds: artistic work with none of art's integrity and no control over the finished product; self - employment without fun or profit."
It's a downbeat, "thirtysomething" world, in which bright, still youngish people are engaged *-1 in a glossy version of day labor, *PRO*-1 doing free - lance, semi-professional work that *T*-2 brings little satisfaction or security but that they know 0 they should be grateful *PRO*-5 to do *T*-3 *T*-4.
Uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives.
Malcolm faces bankruptcy and an IRS audit, but Nora finds an extra $30,000 *U* in her bank account, *PRO* suddenly increasing her available funds some fifteenfold.
While she is wondering whether *PRO* to live it up, and do something even more dramatic, *PRO* say *PRO* get married, her life is further complicated by the reappearance of an old flame, David, a film critic and actor who always *T*-1 seems *-2 to be just on the brink of stardom.
In novels of an earlier vintage, David would have represented excitement and danger; Malcolm, placid, middle - class security.
The irony in this novel is that neither man represents a "safe" middle - class haven: Nora's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security, with no firm economic base anywhere.
The characters confront a world in which it *EXP*-1 seems *-3 increasingly difficult *PRO* to find a "middle way" between the extremes of success and failure, wealth and poverty *T*-2.
In *PRO*-1 making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation, Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of *PRO* making them distinctively individual characters.
The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely *-1 to bleed for the plight of health - food eaters.
But readers may well feel the pangs of recognition.
In any case, the foundering middle classes aren't the only ones in trouble--or whose troubles *T*-1 provide material for fiction.
"Rascal Money" (Contemporary Books, 412 pages, $17.95 *U*), a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber, tells the story of an innovative, well - run, widely respected computer manufacturing company called * *PRO*-4 PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW, a much smaller corporation that *T*-2 is so incompetently *ICH*-3 managed *-1 as *PRO* to constitute a standing joke in the business world.
Patrician, dynamic Scott Thatcher, founder and head of PegaSys, initially finds the takeover threat risible.
But, as he and his skilled team soon discover, they're up against two factors 0 they hadn't counted on *T*-1: first, a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company 0 it hopes *PRO*-4 to acquire *T*-3 in order *PRO*-5 to finance the takeover *T*-2; second, that standing behind AIW is *T*-6 a sinister consortium of much bigger, shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal.
Mr. Garber manages *PRO*-1 to invest this tale of financial wars with the colorful characters and fast - paced action of a suspense novel.
And like a spy or mystery story, this novel has strong elements of allegory, as the good and evil forces battle it out.
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally *T*-1 descends to the realm of cliched caricatures.
Standard - issue portraits of flaky Californians, snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions.
Yet the heavy - handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this: If the head of AIW were not portrayed *-2 as an utterly contemptible, malicious dolt, we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated *-1, and would not be so diverted in the process.
Ms. Rubin is a free - lance writer based * in Los Angeles.
MCI COMMUNICATIONS Corp. said 0 it filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for issuance of as much as $750 million *U* of debt securities.

The funds will be used *-1 for *PRO* refinancing existing debt of the Washington, D.C., concern at lower interest rates and for other general purposes.
The effective date of the registration is *-2 to be determined *-1 by the SEC.

Chicago businessmen Bertram M. Lee and Peter Bynoe signed a new agreement *PRO* to purchase the Denver Nuggets basketball team, but not as principal owners.
On Saturday, the partners said 0 the team would be purchased *-1 for $54 million *U* by a new group including Comsat Video Enterprises Inc., a unit of Communications Satellite Corp. based * here.
Comsat Video will pay $17 million *U* for a 62.5% interest, with Messrs. Lee and Bynoe putting up $8 million *U* for a 37.5% stake in the team.
Under terms of the sale, Nuggets owner Sidney Shlenker could receive up to $11 million *U* in additional payments from the franchise's future earnings.
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe last July announced a deal that *T*-1 would have made them the first black principal owners of a major professional sports franchise.
But the deal fell apart last week for lack of financing.
Comsat Video is headed *-1 by Robert Wussler, who *T*-2 resigned his No. 2 executive post with Turner Broadcasting System Inc. just two weeks ago *PRO*-3 to take the Comsat position.
Comsat Video, which *T*-1 distributes *PRO* pay - per - view programs to hotel rooms, plans *PRO*-2 to add Nuggets games to their offerings, as Mr. Turner did successfully with his Atlanta Hawks and Braves sports teams.
Messrs. Lee and Bynoe will manage the Nuggets' day - today affairs.
France's national tobacco company, known * for *PRO* making brown - tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises and Gitanes, is branching out.
*PRO*-2 Concerned by dipping demand for its traditional products, it is moving not only into blonde cigarettes, but also into electronic car - parking payment cards 0 *T*-3 to be sold *-1 in neighborhood tobacco stores.
Brown tobacco in France is a more pungent, stronger grade than the lighter grade, or blonde tobacco, used * in so - called American - style cigarettes.
"We aren't Philip Morris Cos.," says *T*-1 Bertrand de Galle, chairman of government - owned Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs & Allumettes S.A., *PRO* known * as Seita.
He says that because Seita's profits are limited *-1 by government - controlled cigarette prices, he doesn't have the cash 0 *PRO* to diversify as heavily *ICH*-2 into food and drink as the U.S. concern has done *T*-3.
(Last year, for example, Seita's net profit soared 150% to 461.6 million French francs ($73.5 million *U*) on sales of FFr 27.68 billion *U* - a 1.7% profit margin.)
Instead, he said in an interview, 0 he is looking for ways 0 *PRO* to exploit France's network of 39,000 tobacco agents, most of them cafes *T*-1.
While Seita doesn't own the French tabacs, its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities.
One proposal is *PRO* to introduce a new payment system for parking in Paris.
Instead of *PRO*-2 paying for parking by *PRO* putting money in the existing machines, which *T*-1 deliver little paper receipts, drivers would be able *PRO*-2 to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops.
Once *PRO* activated *-3, the card would sit in the car's window, *PRO*-2 showing traffic wardens how much time the motorist could remain *T*-1.
When the motorist returned to his car *T*-1 he could turn the card off and, if it showed time remaining, save it for later.
Seita is a partner in the project, which *T*-2 was developed *-1 by Matra SA *PRO* using Japanese technology.
Seita and Matra currently are negotiating with city officials for the right *PRO* to begin service.
And Seita is considering further diversification.
It wanted *PRO*-1 to buy RJR Nabisco Inc.'s French cracker subsidiary, Belin, in hopes of *PRO*-1 selling its products in tobacco stores, but lost the bidding to food group BSN SA.
It currently is considering *PRO*-1 bidding for Swedish Match Co.
And it retains an interest in *PRO* acquiring candies and other articles that *T*-2 might be sold *-1 in tobacco shops.
It also is trying *PRO*-1 to shore up its tobacco business.
Brown - tobacco cigarettes such as Gauloises now make up just 40% of the French tobacco market, half the level of about two decades ago.
While Seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in France, it is being hurt *-1 by rising imports and from waning cigarette demand.
So Seita has introduced blonde cigarettes under the Gauloises label, and intends *PRO*-1 to relaunch the unsuccessful Gitanes Blondes in new packaging, similar to the slide - packs used * by brown - tobacco Gitanes.
The aim, says *?* Mr. de Galle, is *PRO* to win market share from imported cigarettes, and *PRO* to persuade smokers who *T*-1 are switching to blonde cigarettes *PRO*-4 to keep *-3 buying French.
In the hard - hit Marina neighborhood, life after the earthquake is often all too real, but sometimes surreal.
Some scenes:--Saturday morning, a resident was given *-1 15 minutes 0 *PRO* to scurry into a sagging building and reclaim what she could *T*-2 of her life's possessions *T*-3.
Saturday night she dined in an emergency shelter on salmon steaks prepared * by chefs from one of the city's four - star restaurants.
-- Mayor Art Agnos stands in the glare of television lights *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-3 to explain for the 20th time why the city is severely restricting access to badly damaged structures *T*-1.
A couple in fashionable spandex warm - up suits jogs by, headphones jauntily in place, *PRO*-2 weaving their way along a street of fractured and fallen houses.
At a nearby corner, they swerve perilously close to a listing apartment house, *PRO*-1 oblivious to any danger.
A policeman shakes his head in amazement as he steers them away.
-- A young woman who *T*-1 has been out of town shows up at the Marina Middle School *PRO*-2 to learn that her apartment is on the condemned list.
She is told *-1 0 she can't enter unless she is accompanied *-2 by an inspector.
She bursts into tears and walks away.
Nearby, five temporary residents of the school shelter *ICH*-2 sit on stools, *PRO*-1 having their necks and backs kneaded by volunteer masseuses.
The Marina rescue center offered a very San Franciscan response to the disaster.
In addition to free massages, there was free counseling, phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club, which *T*-1 offered up its showers, saunas and hot tubs.
The cafeteria offered donated croissants and brie for breakfast, and for dinner, pasta salad and chocolate mousse torts along with the salmon.
"This has been a 15 - pound earthquake for me," said *T*-2 resident Joan O'Shea, who *T*-1 works in an acupuncturist's office.
She and some friends are considering *PRO*-1 offering earthquake victims free yoga classes and "aroma therapy"--massages with scented oils.
She finds the response of Marina residents--primarily yuppies and elderly people--to the devastation of their homes "incredible.
People have been very respectful of each other.
I don't know if this would have happened somewhere else."
Out on the streets, some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed *-1 a 15 - minute scavenger hunt through their possessions.
"It *EXP*-3's so weird *PRO* to have *-4 to decide what *T*-1's really important to you," said *T*-2 Barbara May.
She went first for personal mementos.
In post-earthquake parlance, her building is a "red."
After *PRO* being inspected *-1, buildings with substantial damage were color - coded *-2.
Green allowed residents to re-enter; yellow allowed limited access; red allowed residents one last entry *PRO*-3 to gather everything 0 they could *T*-1 within 15 minutes.
Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness.
Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases, others threw goods out windows.
It didn't help that on Saturday, after three days of sunshine, it rained.
"The guys are going for their skis, their stereos, their personal computers," said *T*-2 Frank Fitzgerald, who *T*-1 helped others *PRO*-3 empty their apartments.
"The women wanted photo albums, a certain brooch, kind of sentimental things."
He showed an unbroken, still - ticking pocket watch that he retrieved *T*-1 for one woman.
It belonged to her grandfather.
Some residents defied orders and returned to "red" buildings *PRO*-1 to retrieve goods.
One building was upgraded *-1 to red status while people were taking things out, and a resident who *T*-2 wasn't allowed *-6 to go back inside called up the stairs to his girlfriend, *PRO*-3 telling her *PRO*-4 to keep *-5 sending things down to the lobby.
A policewoman had *-3 to be called *-1 in *PRO* to make her leave; the policewoman helped *PRO* carry out one last load.
Enforcement of restricted - entry rules was sporadic, residents said 0 *T*-1.
One man trying *PRO* to remove his car was told *-1 by officials *PRO*-2 to get out of his garage.
When he sneaked back later *PRO*-3 to try again *T*-1, a different policeman offered *PRO*-2 to help him *PRO*-4 get the car out.
The Marina also has become the focal point of city efforts *PRO* to reunite residents with any pets that *T*-1 may have fled or become lost during the earthquake.
On lampposts along Fillmore Street, a major Marina artery, posters were offering a $100 *U* reward for a cat lost * during the quake.
The San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also has been providing medical care, food, water and foster homes for quake - displaced animals.
The SPCA says 0 it has received more than 100 requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and cats, though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish.
For example, one parakeet owner returning home found that her apartment, like many others in the Marina, didn't have heat.
"She can stay there with no heat, but for a parakeet, that can be deadly," says *T*-1 Daralee Konowitch, animalcare services manager for the SPCA.
A warm foster home has been found *-1.
Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $1.82 billion *U* for the first 10 days of October, down from $3.16 billion *U* a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said 0 *T*-1.
The latest drop shows 0 the narrowing in the nation's trade gap reflected * in successive full monthly reports is continuing.
The report follows five - consecutive declines in full monthly figures.
Imports rose sharply in the period, to $5.19 billion *U* from $4.04 billion *U* a year earlier, a change of 28%.
Exports during the period were $7.01 billion *U*, 2.6% below $7.20 billion *U* a year ago.
Groupe AG's chairman said 0 the Belgian insurer is prepared *PRO*-1 to give up some of its independence to a white knight if *PRO* necessary *PRO*-2 to repel a raider.
Amid heavy buying of shares in Belgium's largest insurer, Maurice Lippens also warned in an interview that a white knight, in *PRO*-1 buying out a raider, could leave speculators with big losses on their AG stock.
Since the beginning of the year, the stock has nearly doubled, *PRO* giving AG a market value of about 105 billion Belgian francs ($2.7 billion *U*).
The most likely white knight would be Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., which *T*-2 already owns 18% of AG and which *T*-3 itself is controlled *-1 by Cie . Financiere de Suez, the acquisitive French financial conglomerate.
But Mr. Lippens said 0 a rescue also could involve Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co., which *T*-1 owns 5% of AG.
AG is hardly alone in its anxiety.
A rambunctious shake - up is quickly reshaping Europe's once - stately insurance business.
*PRO*-2 Worried by European Community directives that *T*-1991 will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services, *PRO* starting in mid-1990, insurers are rushing *PRO*-2 to find partners and preparing for price wars.
In West Germany and the Netherlands, insurers are flirting with banks.
In France, Suez and Axa - Midi Assurances S.A. both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions; Suez last month acquired control of Groupe Victoire, the sixth - largest European insurance company, after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle.
Mr. Lippens said 0 the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September.
But he estimated that a raider would have been able *PRO*-1 to amass no more than 4% of the shares in recent months.
Aside from *PRO*-1 exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions, Mr. Lippens has called top managers of companies rumored * as potential raiders--among them, Axa - Midi, Union des Assurances de Paris and Suez, all based in France.
They have all "very clearly stated that they have not acquired *RNR*-1 and are not acquiring *RNR*-1 shares of AG," he said 0 *T*-3.
Any raider would find it *EXP*-1 hard *PRO* to crack AG's battlements.
A "syndicate" of shareholders holds just under 50% of AG, Mr. Lippens said 0 *?*, and members have agreed *PRO*-2 to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any AG shares.
Aside from Generale de Belgique and Asahi, the syndicate includes Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas, a Belgian savings bank, and various family interests.
A Generale spokesman confirmed that the giant Belgian holding company would be willing *PRO*-1 to raise its stake in AG should a raider seek control.
Asahi officials couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
Even without bid talk, this year's surge in prices for Brussels real estate has excited interest in AG.
The company says 0 those holdings constitute the third - biggest real - estate portfolio in Belgium.
Translant Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., got an $86 million *U* Navy contract for missile - launch systems.

The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co.'s Vermont - Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime - ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area 0 one would choose *PRO*-2 to visit *T*-1.
But *PRO* turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb.
Only it is safer, and busier.
Over the past year there have been only one burglary, three thefts of or from autos, no purse - snatchings, and one attempted robbery in the mall, which *T*-2 opened in late 1981.
A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would, per year, be expected *-1 to have eight burglaries, 70 thefts of or from autos, and four robberies.
The Watts mall has annual sales of more than $350 *U* per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $200 *U*.
Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well.
A successful low - crime mall in a high - crime area violates the more typical inner - city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken *T*-2 *-1 over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability.
Major regional and national chain stores are replaced *-1 by mom - and - pop operations offering poorer - quality merchandise at higher prices.
Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is *T*-1 an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used *-3 to provide *T*-2 to community residents.
Thus there is even more to the Vermont - Slauson Center than a good place to shop.
This defensible commercial zone becomes, for the residents, a secure oasis in a barren urban landscape, evidence that community decay is not inevitable and that the gangs are not invincible.
The center improves the community image to outsiders as well, and may help *PRO* to arrest *RNR*-1, or even reverse *RNR*-1, the exodus of capital and investment.
An additional benefit is the creation of jobs.
This starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers.
It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont - Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private - sector jobs at a one - time cost in public funds of only $2,500 *U* per job.
As many of these jobs are filled *-1 by local residents, who *T*-2 move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls, the $2,500 *U* - per - job public investment should repay itself in a few years.
And that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales, real estate, licenses and the like.
Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont - Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont - Slauson Center and uses the money *PRO*-1 to provide moderate and low - cost housing in the community--now running into the hundreds of units--as well as commercial and industrial development projects.
Bradford Crowe, director of the mayor's City Economic Development Office, says: "There is no question that Vermont - Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.
What *T*-1 had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock, thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont - Slauson yields *T*-2."
Another benefit is that substantial percentages of the proprietors in these centers are minority businessmen and women.
In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed * by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago's Third Ward, opposite the Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of the stores to date have been leased *-1 to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups.
Children from the community will have worthier role models than the drug kingpins.
So what *T*-1's the catch?
Primarily that *PRO* putting one of these inner - city deals together takes time, patience, breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess *T*-1.
Security costs are also quite high.
One of these centers can involve years of *PRO* negotiating with numerous public agencies, local political leaders, and citizen groups, and with prospective tenants and sources of financing.
Suburban deals are not without their delays and complications--inner - city deals just have more of them.
Security at a typical Haagen inner - city center is impressive, but unobtrusive.
The entire site is enclosed *-1 by a 6 - to - 8 - foot - high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote - controlled gates.
Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress - like appearance.
Infrared motion detectors and closed - circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard.
The security command post, camouflaged * as second - story retail space, has its own "crow's nest" above the roofs of the other buildings, with a panoramic view of the entire center.
Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated * by the center.
These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group's Grand Boulevard Plaza.
Haagen has its own large security force of well - trained and well - paid personnel on round - the - clock duty at each center.
Security is 60% to 70% *U* of the common area charges of these centers, vs. an industry average of about 15%.
These security costs are kept *-1 *PRO*-3 off - budget because the centers' site acquisition, construction, and financing costs were reduced *-2 by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants, Economic Development Administration Grants, Community Development Block Grants, tax - free Industrial Development Bonds, Enterprise Zone tax write - offs, city infrastructure grants, and tax increment financing.
Many of these programs no longer exist, or have been severely cut back.
However, since these centers appear *-1 to pay for themselves, there is nothing *PRO* to prevent state and local governments from *PRO*-2 enacting legislation with similar provisions.
Many states already have Enterprise Zones and legislation that *T*-1 combines tax incentives, loans, and grants *PRO* to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the unemployed and minorities.
These programs could be expanded *-1 *PRO*-5 to focus on funds for project planning *ICH*-4, *PRO* identifying sources of funds, and for *PRO* acquiring a site and preparing it.
*PRO* Combatting crime and the fear of it in inner - city commercial areas should give Enterprise Zones more success than most have enjoyed to date.
With many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers, inner - city areas may represent a major new untapped market for investment.
New approaches to mall design and operation make it *EXP*-1 possible *PRO* to tap these markets.
If the risks and rewards are reasonable, developers will respond.
Government officials who *T*-1 wonder how important it *EXP*-4 is *T*-2 for them to encourage development in high - risk areas should visit Vermont - Slauson and Grand Boulevard Plaza and decide for themselves.
The answer will be obvious.
Mr. Titus is a researcher at the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice.
*PRO*-1 Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant, architect William McDonough seems *-1 oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting.
He is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts.
"*PRO* Look how much air *T*-1 is moving around!" he says *?*.
"The ventilation here is great!"
You may be hearing more about the 38 - year - old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air.
After years of relative obscurity, he is starting *-1 to attract notice for the ecological *RNR*-2 as well as the aesthetic *RNR*-2 quality of his architecture.
Mr. McDonough believes that the well - being of the planet depends on such stratagems as *PRO* opening windows *PRO* to cut indoor air pollution, tacking down carpets instead of *PRO* using toxic glues, and avoiding mahogany, which *T*-1 comes from endangered rain forests.
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four - star Quilted Giraffe restaurant--"architecturally impeccable," Progressive Architecture magazine called it *PRO*-2 *T*-1--and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store.
He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space.
He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
What *T*-1 really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture.
Now the question is: Is Poland ready for it?
Mr. McDonough is about *-1 to tackle his biggest clean - air challenge yet, the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in Poland, the first such center in Eastern Europe.
The project has already acquired a certain New York cachet.
Bloomingdale's plans *PRO*-1 to sell a foot - tall chocolate model of the center during the holidays.
Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS.
A cake topped * with a replica of the center will be auctioned *-1 at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby's in December.
If Mr. McDonough's plans get executed *-2, as much of the Polish center as possible will be made *-1 from aluminum, steel and glass recycled * from Warsaw's abundant rubble.
A 20 - story mesh spire will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space.
Solar - powered batteries will make the spire glow.
The windows will open.
The carpets won't be glued down, and walls will be coated *-1 with nontoxic finishes.
To the extent that the $150 million *U* budget will allow it *T*-1, Mr. McDonough will rely on solid wood, rather than plywood or particle board, *PRO*-2 to limit the emission of formaldehyde.
If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming 0 many scientists fear *T*-1.
The Poles would plant a 10 - square - mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000 *U*, with the center's developer footing the bill.
The news hasn't exactly moved others in Mr. McDonough's profession *PRO*-1 to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds.
All architects want *PRO*-2 to be aware of the ecological consequences of their work, says 0 *?* John Burgee, whose New York firm *T*-1 is designing the redevelopment of Times Square, "but we can't all carry it to that extreme."
Karen Nichols, senior associate at Michael Graves's architecture firm in Princeton, N.J., says: "We're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do *T*-1 readily."
Mr. McDonough responds: "I'm asking people *PRO*-1 to broaden their agendas."
The son of a Seagram's executive who *T*-2 was stationed *-1 in many countries around the world, Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before *PRO*-3 entering Dartmouth College.
He earned a master's degree in architecture from Yale.
His interest in the natural environment dates from his youth.
He and his father still spend time each summer *PRO*-1 fly - fishing for salmon in Iceland.
*PRO* Living in Hong Kong, he says 0 *?*, made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies.
At his first school in the U.S. he was thought *-1 a little strange for *PRO*-1 shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates *PRO*-2 to take only brief showers.
He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that *T*-1 restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont.
At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses 0 *T*-2 to be built *-1 in Ireland.
Mr. McDonough's first professional project 0 fully *T*-1 to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.
The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14 - foot ceilings and big, operable windows.
Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts *PRO* to conserve energy by *PRO*-1 sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution.
To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office.
Jute, rather than a synthetic material, lies under the tacked - down carpets, and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic.
The budget was only $400,000 *U*.
"Athens with Spartan means," Mr. McDonough says *T*-1.
The fund's lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees.
Economists and administrators sit along a "boulevard" with street lamps and ficus trees.
In offices, triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight.
Offices with outside windows have inside windows, too, *PRO* to let in more real daylight.
"We proved 0 a healthy office doesn't cost more," says *T*-1 Frederic Krupp, executive director of the fund.
It "really looks beautiful and is very light," says *T*-2 Ann Hornaday, a free - lance writer who *T*-1 has visited the office for lunch meetings.
But, she says, "I guess 0 I didn't really notice the trees.
Maybe they were hidden *-1 by all the people."
Neither the Quilted Giraffe nor the Paul Stuart renovation reflects much of Mr. McDonough's environmental concern.
The restaurant was conceived *-1 as a sparkling, crystalline "geode."
It makes extensive use of stainless steel, silver and aluminum that *T*-1 sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc - strip floors.
*PRO*-1 To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used * for paneling at Paul Stuart, however, Mr. McDonough and friends planted 1,000 acorns around the country.
The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials.
Its developer is a Polish American, Sasha Muniak.
He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center.
The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment, not readily accessible in Poland now, for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe.
Mr. McDonough thinks of the center as the "Eiffel Tower of Warsaw" and "a symbol of the resurgence of Poland."
If any nation can use environmentally benign architecture, it is Poland.
Jessica Mathews, vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington, D.C., says that perhaps a quarter of Poland's soil is too contaminated *-1 for safe farming because of air pollution.
The pollution is also killing forests and destroying buildings that *T*-1 date back to the Middle Ages.
The future of the forest remains uncertain.
Mr. Muniak's company, Balag Ltd., has agreed *PRO*-2 to set aside the money 0 *PRO* to plant and maintain it *T*-3, but discussions are still going on over where *PRO* to place it *T*-4 and how *PRO* to ensure that it will be maintained *-1 *T*-5.
After all, Mr. Muniak says, "0 in Poland there aren't too many people worried about the environment.
They're more worried about bread on the table.
ATHLONE INDUSTRIES Inc. said that on Dec. 21 it will redeem $10 million *U* face amount of its $59.3 million *U* of 15.625% subordinated notes outstanding, due June 1, 1991.

Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. is redemption agent.
ENGRAPH INC. recently reported third - quarter earnings, which *T*-2 were mistakenly shown in the Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in last Tuesday's edition *-1 to be lower than the average of analysts' estimates.
Zacks Investment Research didn't adjust one analyst's estimate for a stock split, which therefore *T*-1 was artificially high.
Engraph's third - quarter net income of 15 cents a share actually was 7% higher than the adjusted average of estimates.
Spending by average Japanese households in August fell an adjusted 1.9% from a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau of the Prime Minister's Office said 0 *T*-1.

OPEC's ability *PRO* to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning *-1 to cast a shadow over world oil markets.
Output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out.
But industry and OPEC officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity *PRO* to glut the market and cause an oil - price collapse a few months from now if OPEC doesn't soon adopt a new quota system *PRO*-1 to corral its chronic cheaters.
As a result, the effort *ICH*-1 by some oil ministers *PRO* to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production - sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency.
The organization is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25.
So far this year, rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices *PRO*-1 firm despite rampant cheating by others.
But that could change if demand for OPEC's oil softens seasonally early next year as some think 0 *PRO* may happen.
OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self - imposed fourth - quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored * by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune.
At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits, they said 0 *T*-1.
But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day--and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day--of spare capacity still exists within OPEC.
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries, including his own, Issam Al - Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, told *T*-1 the conference Friday.
He puts OPEC's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day.
That's higher than some other estimates.
Ali Khalifa Al - Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day.
Either way, the overhang is big enough *PRO* to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge.
Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could upset the market.
The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly *PRO* to maintain a stable market.
However, in interviews later, both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based *-2 mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member.
Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system.
"If you are already producing at 95% or 100% *U* of your capacity, what's *T*-2 the good *PRO* to be told *-1 0 you can produce at 105% of capacity?" asked *T*-3 Mr. Al - Chalabi.
At an inconclusive Geneva meeting late last month, OPEC's oil ministers halfheartedly approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling.
They doled it out *PRO*-3 using the existing formula, however, which *T*-1 meant that even those countries that *T*-2 couldn't produce more received higher official allotments.
The main effect of the ceiling boost was *PRO* to "legitimize" some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters.
Still, there was a breakthrough at Geneva.
Previously, no OPEC member had been willing *PRO*-1 to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group's total output target, or ceiling.
But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity, advanced * there in an Iranian proposal, was generally endorsed *-1 by the ministers.
In the end politics got in the way.
Libya accepted Iran's proposal only so long as it was promised *-1 production parity with Kuwait.
And the United Arab Emirates, a chronic quota cheater, refused *PRO*-1 to give any guarantee 0 it would change its ways.
But the oil ministers continue *-1 to study the plan, and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month's meeting.
It's understood 0 several compromises already have been worked *-1 into the plan.
The ceiling would be lifted *-1 to 21.5 million barrels *PRO*-1 to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while *PRO*-2 reducing percentage shares of some others.
Libya's previous conditions are no longer considered *-1 a problem, although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, also has surfaced as a possible obstacle, some OPEC sources said 0 *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Insisting on a 24.5% share of any ceiling, Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members.
In Geneva, however, they supported Iran's proposal because it would have left the Saudi percentage of the OPEC total *PRO*-1 intact, and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million.
Some of the proposed modifications since, however, call on Saudi Arabia to "give back" to the production - sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels.
Though *PRO* tiny, that's a reduction in its share.
Mr. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on *PRO* maintaining its percentage share of OPEC production under any quota revisions.
"Under any circumstances, Saudi Arabia should get more" rather than less, Mr. Nazer said *T*-1.
When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago *T*-1, Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory.
Now his half - dozen employees work in an eighth - floor shop that he says 0 *T*-1 is smaller than his old storage room.
He also says 0 he is losing money now.
He blames imports.
But just down Seventh Avenue, where about 75% of U.S. fur garments are made *-1 *T*-2, Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets, broadened his fur - making line and expanded into leather.
He credits imports.
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years *T*-1.
One stuck to old - line business traditions, while the other embraced the change.
"The small, good fur salon is not what it used *-2 to be *T*-1," says *T*-3 Mr. Purnick, 75 years old.
"We make the finest product in the world, and the Americans are being kicked around *-1."
Mr. Rosen, though, believes 0 imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years *T*-1.
"You've got some minds here that *T*-1 won't think progressively," he says *T*-2.
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started *-1 aggressively marketing "working - girl mink" and similar lower - priced imported furs in recent years.
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored * by higher - priced furriers: the younger woman--even in her late 20s--who *T*-1 never thought 0 she could buy a mink.
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $1.8 billion *U* a year now, triple the level in the late 1970s.
It also opened the door to furs made * in South Korea, China, Hong Kong and other countries.
Jindo Furs, a large South Korean maker, says 0 it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans *PRO*-1 to open 15 more by the end of next year.
Mr. Purnick and other old - line furriers call many of the the imports *PRO*-1 unstylish and poorly made.
High - end U.S. furriers say 0 these imports haven't squeezed them.
But low - priced and middle - priced furriers like Mr. Purnick, who *T*-1 once saturated the five - block Seventh Avenue fur district, say 0 imports have cut their sales.
A woman who *T*-1 once would have saved for two or three seasons *PRO*-2 to buy a U.S. - made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $2,000 *U*.
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage.
Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing *PRO*-1 to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation.
In 1982, he started a factory in Greece.
Two years later, he opened one in West Germany.
He also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur, and he decided *PRO*-1 to follow suit.
By *PRO*-1 combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad, he says 0 he has been able *PRO*-2 to produce high - quality goods at low cost.
*PRO* To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources, he says 0 he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. .
But six years ago he also began *-1 importing from the Far East.
*PRO*-1 Inspired *-2 by imports, Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs, hats and flings.
This year he produced a men's line and offers dyed furs in red, cherry red, violet, royal blue and forest green.
He has leather jackets from Turkey that *T*-1 are lined *-2 with eel skin and topped *-2 off with raccoon - skin collars.
From Asia, he has mink jackets with floral patterns made * by *PRO* using different colored furs.
Next he will be testing pictured embroidery (called * *PRO*-1 kalega) made * in the Far East.
He plans *PRO*-1 to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets.
Besides *PRO*-2 adding to sales, leathers also attract retailers who *T*-1 may buy furs later, he adds 0 *T*-3.
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers.
Seymour Schreibman, the 65 - year - old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc., treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin *PRO*-1 to produce a reversible fur - and - leather garment.
He says 0 it accounts for 25% of total sales.
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales.
This year he bought two stores, one in Brooklyn and one in Queens.
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing.
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began *-1 retailing aggressively eight years ago, and now retail sales account for about 20% of gross income.
In other moves, Mr. Rosen says 0 he bought a truck three years ago *PRO*-1 to reach more retailers.
Since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest.
Small retailers who *T*-1 can't afford *PRO*-2 to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game.
Such moves have helped Mr. Rosen *PRO*-1 weather the industry slump of recent years.
The industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980, but since 1986 sales have languished at their $1.8 billion *U* peak.
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc., Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years.
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons.
In addition, competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats, *PRO* driving prices down.
The animal - rights movement hasn't helped sales.
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand, too, furriers complain 0 *T*-1.
And those who *T*-1 didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages.
"The intensive labor needed * *PRO* to manufacture furs {in the U.S. .} is not as available as it was *?*," says *T*-2 Mr. Schreibman, who *T*-1 is starting overseas production.
But even those who *T*-1 have found a way 0 *PRO* to cope with the imports and the slump *T*-2, fear that furs are losing part of their allure.
"People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business," says Stephen Sanders, divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field's department store in Chicago.
"You can't make a commodity out of a luxury," insists *T*-1 Mr. Purnick, the New York furrier.
He contends that *PRO* chasing consumers with low - priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by *PRO*-1 reducing the prestige of furs.
But Mr. Rosen responds: "Whatever people want *PRO*-1 to buy *T*-2, I'll sell *T*-3.
The name of the game is *PRO* to move goods.
THROUGHOUT THE 1980s, investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning.
Capital has been democratized *-1, and people want in.
Too often, however, small investors are left *-1 with the same stale solutions that *T*-2 appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists.
Now a startling new approach *ICH*-1 is available to *PRO* building your financial portfolio without undue risk, without extensive planning and without *PRO* hurting your life style one bit!
This is particularly good news for those who *T*-2 hate risk, who *T*-3 are incapable of *PRO* doing extensive amounts of planning and who *T*-4 refuse *PRO*-5 to see their life styles hurt *-6 in any way.
You know who you are *T*-1.
My revolutionary system is also useful for those who *T*-1 have tried customary forms of *PRO* growing their currency cushion.
Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity, I do find it *EXP*-2 necessary *PRO* to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools, if only *PRO*-3 to assuage my father - in - law, who *T*-1 believes in such things.
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs, and tinkered with stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as *PRO*-1 preserving my necessary position in the residential real - estate market.
Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative *T*-1.
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses 0 I've invested in *T*-1 during this prosperous decade (*PRO* see accompanying illustration--WSJ Oct. 20, 1989).
Oil - related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985, at which point the industry, while *PRO*-1 not lighting up any Christmas trees, began a slow recovery *T*-2.
Likewise, mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what *T*-1 was, for me, a serious investment.
By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, *PRO* causing my broker at Pru - Bache to remark that she'd "never seen anything like it."
*PRO*-1 Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them--and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health.
Perhaps most dramatic was *T*-2 the performance of the metropolitan New York real - estate market, which *T*-1 was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years *T*-3.
*PRO*-2 Disgusted, I cast around for a different way 0 *PRO* to plan my asset distribution *T*-3, and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer *ICH*-4 struck me: I was doing it already!
We've all got money 0 *PRO* to spend *T*-1, some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it.
*PRO* Bank it?
Not really!
*PRO* Sock it away in long - term instruments?
Nonsense!
Daily living is the best possible investment!
Your priorities may be different, but here in Figure 2 is *T*-1 where I've chosen *PRO*-2 to build for the future *T*-3: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment, bulbs and shrubs; and finally, entertainment, perhaps the best investment of all.
All have paid off for me in double - digit annual growth and continue *-1 to provide significant potential.
At least, according to my calculations.
Personal space (Figure 3) has grown 35% annually over the course of the decade, a performance that *T*-1 would compare positively with an investment in, say, synthetic - leather products for the interiors of cold - weather vehicles, which my cousin got into *T*-2 and sort of regrets *T*-2 to this day.
The assortment of expensive children's toys that I have purchased *T*-2 wisely at a host of discount - toy brokerage firms (Figure 4) has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except, perhaps, for my record collection, whose worth, I think 0 it *EXP*-3's safe *PRO* to say *?*, *T*-1 is incalculable.
Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (Figure 5), with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value.
According to my calculations, these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan *ICH*-1 to more than $22,000 *U* on the open market (Figure 6), where I plan *PRO*-2 to offer it shortly *T*-3.
Expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns, shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale.
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay *PRO*-1 to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers.
My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold, according to my conservative calculations.
At the same time, my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning.
Over the course of the decade, for instance, my return on investment in the area of poker alone (Figures 7A and 7B) has been most impressive, *PRO*-2 showing bodacious annual expansion with--given the way 0 my associates play *T*-1--no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond *ICH*-3.
With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life - style investments and increasing widespread leverage.
My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have *-1 to cash in their toy portfolio *PRO*-1 to take advantage of it.
But with every step 0 I take *T*-1, I'm building wealth.
You can *?*, too, if you, like me, refuse *PRO*-1 to bite the bullet.
So *PRO* go out there and eat that debt.
You're right there in the mainstream of American business, *PRO*-1 building value on the back of insupportable expenditures.
Henry Kravis, *PRO* watch out!
Mr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300-day estimate.
In *PRO*-1 finding "good news" in Berkeley's new freshman admissions plan ("The Privileged Class," editorial, Sept. 20), you're reading the headline but not the story.
The plan indeed raises from 40% to 50% the number of freshmen applicants admitted * strictly by academic criteria.
But that doesn't mean 0 "half of the students attending Berkeley" will be admitted this way.
The plan is talking about applicants admitted *, not students who *T*-1 enroll.
Since the "yield" from this top slice of applicants is relatively low, *PRO* boosting admits from 40% to 50% will boost registrants from about 31% to 38% of the class.
In addition, perhaps 5% of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials "*T*-1 narrowly missed" *PRO*-2 gaining them admission in the first category.
But against that combined increase of 12% in students chosen * by academic criteria, the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based *-1 on grades, test scores and "supplemental points" for factors such as high - school curriculum, English - language proficiency and an essay *T*-2.
This category now accounts for about 19% of admits and 22% of registrants.
The plan thus will decrease by 22%, for a net loss of 10%, the number of students admitted * primarily by academic criteria.
Who *T*-1 will take over these places?
The plan creates a new category of students from "socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds," a concept not yet defined *, and gives them about 10% of the class.
One of the plan's authors has defended the "socioeconomic disadvantage" category as perhaps *PRO*-1 making more sense than the current affirmative - action preferences based * on race.
Perhaps it does *?*.
But the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley's broad racial preferences.
Nor will students from racial - minority groups who *T*-2 are admitted *-1 through the new category be counted *-3 against the affirmative - action "target" for their group.
The plan thus places a large new affirmative - action program, based * on "socioeconomic disadvantage," on top of the existing program based * on race.
The role of academic criteria in *PRO* choosing Berkeley's freshmen can only decline as a result.

AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County, Miss., Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising.
He sold quarter - inch fingerlings 0 *T*-2 to stock other farmers' ponds, and he bought back one - pound - or - so food - fish that he "live - hauled" *T*-1 to market along with his own whiskery crop.
And he nearly always bought and sold for cash.
Along the way, Mr. Tharp omitted a total of $1.5 million *U* from his receipts reported * on federal tax returns for three years.
The returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator, Samuel James Baker.
Mr. Baker interviewed *RNR*-1 or wrote to *RNR*-1 hundreds of catfish farmers, live - haulers and processors throughout the South before *PRO*-2 coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales, in pounds and dollars, by Mr. Tharp and others.
*PRO* Unknown to Mr. Tharp, he had fouled his net on a special IRS project 0 *T*-1 to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined *PRO* to cheat on their taxes.
*PRO*-2 Confronted *-1 with the evidence, Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of *PRO*-2 filing a false return and was fined *-2 $5,000 *U* and sentenced *-2 to 18 months in prison.
He also owes a lot of back taxes, interest and civil fraud penalties.
A lot of taxpayers out there aren't as paranoid as one might think 0 *?*.
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation, on the basis of occupation, high income, type of income, or some other characteristic that *T*-1 may signal an opportunity or tendency *PRO* to hide income or exaggerate deductions.
Many professions long have seemed *-3 to be targets *ICH*-5 because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts *ICH*-4 of some members *PRO* to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters: dentists who *T*-1 invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who *T*-2 raised racehorses on their days off.
Mail - order ministers have been squelched *-1.
Now, television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny.
The IRS recently won part of its long - running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members' payments to the church weren't deductible because the members received services in return *T*-1.
IRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used - car dealers, entertainment producers, masons, roofers, and taxi owners.
Small businesses in general account for almost 40% of unreported personal income, the IRS has said 0 *T*-1.
Once such abuses become so pervasive, the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for *PRO* selecting returns for audit and doesn't need special projects for them.
San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because IRS agents envy their life styles.
Many openings for mass cheating, such as questionable tax shelters and home offices, have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws *PRO*-1 to close them.
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied *-1 by appraisals.
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS *PRO*-2 to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form - letter inquiries to taxpayers.
Unreported alimony income can be spotted *-1 by computer because a payer of alimony (who *T*-2 gets a deduction) must report the former spouse's Social Security number.
Passport applicants now must give Social Security numbers, *PRO* enabling the IRS *PRO*-1 to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns.
But while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these, the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that *T*-1 need more personal attention.
In most cases, the IRS says 0 *?*, these projects are local or regional, rather than national, and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among, say, factory workers claiming that *PRO* having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses.
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects, according to Marshall V. Washburn, deputy assistant commissioner for examination.
Auditors involved * in noncriminal projects can't send anyone to jail, but they can make life miserable in other ways--for one, by *PRO*-1 imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence, failure *PRO* to file a return, and the like.
The targeted audit groups include direct sellers--people who *T*-1 sell cosmetics, housewares and other items door to door or at home parties--and employers who *T*-2 label workers as independent contractors instead of employees, *PRO*-3 to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes.
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who *T*-1 get cash tips, people who *T*-2 engage in large cash transactions, and people whose returns *T*-3 show 0 they sold a home for a profit without *PRO*-4 reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year; the gain must be rolled *-5 over within two years *PRO* to defer tax.
And now that returns must show dependents' Social Security numbers, the IRS wants *PRO*-4 to see which dependents *T*-2 show up on more than one return--and which dependents *T*-3 turn out *-5 to be deceased.
Impetus for the direct - seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back.
It prompted an IRS study that *T*-1 found 0 many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs, Mr. Washburn says 0 *T*-2.
The study provided criteria for *PRO* singling out returns of "potentially noncompliant" taxpayers who *T*-1 report low income and large expenses from a part - time business.
The Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill, N.J., who *T*-1 both were part - time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields.
For 1984, they reported gross income of $1,647 *U* from Amway sales, offset * by expenses totaling $16,746 *U*--including car costs of $6,805 *U* and travel and entertainment costs of $5,088 *U*.
The Tax Court didn't believe that the Rubins, who *T*-1 earned $65,619 *U* in their regular jobs, treated the sideline as a real business and derived "merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits" from it.
The Direct Selling Association, a trade group, points out that its members, which *T*-1 include Amway Corp., cooperate with the IRS *PRO*-2 to distribute tax - compliance material to sales people and are helping *PRO* to prepare a public - service television program on the subject.
The independent - contractor project, which *T*-1 began in 1988, involves about 350 IRS agents.
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30, reports 0 *?* Raymond P. Keenan, assistant commissioner for collection, they examined about 13,000 employers, assessed more than $67 million *U* in delinquent employment taxes, and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self - employed contractors.
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions, *PRO*-2 mostly paid *-1 by small firms.
Many workers, especially professionals, want *PRO*-1 to remain independent *PRO*-1 to avoid tax withholding and to continue *-2 to deduct many expenses that employees can't *?* *T*-3.
But many others, who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation, become tipsters for the IRS, says 0 *T*-4 Jerry Lackey, who *T*-2 manages the IRS project's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando.
Firms that *T*-1 are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that *T*-2 aren't *?*, he says 0 *T*-3.
In his area, Mr. Lackey continues 0 *?*, the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction--*PRO*-2 doing framing, drywall, masonry and similar work.
But a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them--including physicians and receptionists--as independent contractors.
The IRS assessed the clinic $350,000 *U* in back payroll taxes.
It assessed nearly $500,000 *U* against a cruise - ship company that *T*-1 carried about 100 deckhands, cooks, bartenders, entertainers and other employees as self - employed independents.
Revenue - short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents, and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $80 million *U* computer system in 1985.
The state's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that *T*-1 license or register professionals and businesses; from exchange agreements with the IRS, 24 other states, and two Canadian provinces, and even from phonebook Yellow Pages.
Thus *PRO*-3 armed *-2 for massive matching of documents by computer, they single out high - income groups, *PRO*-3 looking primarily for people who *T*-1 haven't filed New York income - tax returns.
The state has combed through records relating to architects, stockbrokers, lawyers in the New York City area, construction workers from out of the state, and homeowners who *T*-1 claim *PRO*-3 to be residents of other states--especially Florida, which *T*-2 has no personal income tax.
Soon *PRO*-3 to feel the glare of attention are *T*-2 lawyers elsewhere in the state, doctors, dentists, and accountants, says Frederick G. Hicks, director of the tax - department division that *T*-1 develops the computer - matching programs.
The department has collected over $6.5 million *U* from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution.
In the early stage of *PRO* checking people with incomes exceeding $500,000 *U* who *T*-1 were filing nonresident returns, it squeezed $7.5 million *U* out of a man who *T*-2 was posing as a Florida resident.
"We think 0 we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project," Mr. Hicks declares *T*-1.

COCA - COLA Co . (Atlanta) --
Anton Amon and George Gourlay were elected *-1 *PRO*-2 vice presidents of this soft - drink company.
Mr. Amon, 46 years old, is the company's director of quality assurance; most recently, he served as vice president, operations, for Coca - Cola Enterprises.
Mr. Gourlay, 48, is manager for corporate manufacturing operations; he was assistant vice president at the company.
At the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center, the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes - Benzes and BMWs for another day of *PRO*-1 exercising their credit cards.
They root among the designer offerings at Neiman - Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire.
They stroll through the marble - encased corridors of the Atrium Court.
They graze at the Farmers Market, a combination gourmet food court and grocery store, while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies.
"The beautiful look of wool," croons *?* the show's narrator, "slightly Victorian in its influence...."
Meanwhile, in the squat office buildings that *T*-1 ring Fashion Island, the odds *ICH*-3 are good that someone is getting fleeced *-2.
Law - enforcement authorities say that at any given time, a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here.
"They seem *-3 to like these industrial parks," says *T*-2 Kacy McClelland, a postal inspector who *T*-1 specializes in mail fraud.
"We call them *PRO*-1 fraud farms."
Welcome to that welter of contradictions known * as Newport Beach.
This city of more than 70,000 is known *-1 for sunshine, yachts and rich residents.
It is also known *-1 as the fraud capital of the U.S., *PRO*-1 dubbed *-2 by investigators and the media as the "Cote de Fraud".
How does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low - lifes *T*-1?
Clearly, the existence of the former lures the latter.
The places renowned * for *PRO* breeding bunco, like the Miami neighborhood known * as the "Maggot Mile" and Las Vegas's flashy strip of casinos, invariably offer fast cars, high rollers, glamorous women and lots of sunshine.
You don't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo.
Con men hate snow.
Newport Beach fits the scam artists' specifications perfectly.
What more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for *T*-1?
Nothing seems *-1 hard here.
The breezes are soft, the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily.
Nightlife is plentiful.
Moreover, ostentation is appreciated *-1.
The median price of homes is $547,000 *U*; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 the nation's largest pleasure - boat harbor.
"Blondes, cocaine and Corvettes," mutters *T*-1 Mr. McClelland.
"That's what they're after *T*-1."
The rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists' operation an air of respectability.
"One reason 0 they use Newport Beach *T*-1 is that it sounds swankier than most addresses," says *T*-2 David Katz, a U.S. attorney who, until recently, *T*-3 headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force.
"Newport Beach is known *-1 in Rhode Island for *PRO*-1 having a lot of rich people."
No wonder 0 all kinds of big - time scams *ICH*-1 have flourished here, from phony tax - sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny - stock traders.
But above all, this is the national headquarters for boiler - room operators, those slick - talking snake - oil salesmen who *T*-1 use the telephone *PRO*-2 to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish.
Because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted *-1, nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest *T*-2.
"I've heard that there is $40 billion *U* taken * in nationwide by boiler rooms every year," Mr. McClelland says *T*-1.
"If that's true, Orange County has *-1 to be at least 10% of that."
And most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem *-3 to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well - heeled communities that *T*-1 surround this sliver - like city that *T*-2 hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles.
In fact, sophisticated big - bucks boiler - room scams are known *-1 generically among law - enforcement types as "Newport Beach" operations.
That contrasts with the penny - ante sales of things such as pen - and - pencil sets and office supplies that *T*-2 are known *-1 as "Hollywood" scams.
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil - leasing deals that *T*-1 typically cost thousands of dollars a shot.
The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals.
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room, prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told *-2 that their investment in precious metals was insured *-1 against losses "caused * by employees due to dishonesty, destruction or disappearance," according to an indictment handed * up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month.
Thus *PRO*-4 falsely reassured *-3, investors sent $11.4 million *U* *ICH*-1 to the Newport Beach company, most of which *T*-5 was diverted *-2 to unauthorized uses, the indictment charges 0 *T*-6.
Douglas Jones, an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr., the chairman and president of Capital Trust, says 0 his client denies that there was any attempt *PRO* to defraud investors.
"There were some business deals that *T*-1 went bad," Mr. Jones says *?*, "but no intent *PRO* to defraud."
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars.
Traditionally, boiler rooms operate on the cheap, since few, if any, customers ever visit their offices.
Indeed, the name derives from the tendency *ICH*-1 among telemarketing scammers *PRO* to rent cheap basement space, near the boiler room.
But, says 0 *?* Mr. Katz, the U.S. attorney, "the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices, with plush furnishings.
When we go there *T*-1, it's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses *T*-2."
The Newport Beach operators also tend *-1 to indulge themselves privately.
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine, who *T*-1 is currently serving a six - year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp., which *T*-2 promised investors returns of as much as 625% on precious metals.
Mr. Valentine, who *T*-1 pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles, drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle, an island in Newport's harbor, according to investigators.
With the $3 million *U* received * from investors, he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend, whom he met *T*-1 at the shop where he got his custom - tailored suits *T*-2.
"It *ICH*-3's amazing the amount of money that *T*-1 goes up their nose, out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas," Mr. Katz says *T*-2.
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city's legitimate business element.
Vincent M Ciavarella, regional manager of Property Management Systems, insists 0 he doesn't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases *T*-1 for Irvine Co., the owner and developer of the project.
Mr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who *T*-1 provided "incomplete" financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators "are not easily detectable.
" (Investigators stress that building owners are victims, too, since boiler rooms often leave without *PRO*-1 paying rent.)
Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, calls boiler rooms *PRO*-3 a "negative 0 we wish 0 we could get rid *-2 of *T*-1."
Actually, "we don't get much negative publicity about this," he insists 0 *?*, "except for the press who *T*-1 write about it."

WEIRTON STEEL Corp. said 0 it completed a $300 million *U* sale of 10 - year notes, the final step in the 1984 buy - out of the company from National Steel Corp.
The 10 7/8% notes were priced *-1 at 99.5% *PRO*-2 to yield 10.958% in an offering managed * by Bear, Stearns & Co., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co., the company said 0 *T*-3.
Weirton, of Weirton, W. Va., said 0 $60.3 million *U* of the proceeds were used *-1 *PRO* to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc., the parent of National Steel.
Remaining proceeds were used *-1 *PRO* to pay other debt and to finance the company's capital spending program.
The U.S. is required *-1 *PRO*-3 to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely *PRO* to endanger their lives, government officials said 0 *T*-2.
The notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on *PRO* handling coups outlined * in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee.
The existence of the guidelines has become known *-1 since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday.
Officials familiar with the meeting said 0 Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements 0 the administration contends 0 *T*-1 contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort *PRO* to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
According to the officials, Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines.
They said 0 the president conceded 0 the notification requirement didn't affect his decision *PRO* to lend only minor support to this month's Panama coup effort.
No notification was ever considered *-1, officials said 0 *?*, apparently because the U.S. didn't think 0 the coup plotters intended *PRO*-3 to kill Mr. Noriega, but merely sought *PRO*-3 to imprison him.
What's more, both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely *-3 to be dropped *-1 from the guidelines on coup attempts that *T*-4 are being rewritten *-2 by the panel and the White House.
The rewriting was launched *-1 at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12, a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules *T*-2.
However, the disclosure of the guidelines, first reported * last night by NBC News, is already being interpreted *-1 on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort *PRO* to pressure Congress.
It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who *T*-1 is responsible for the failure *PRO* to oust Mr. Noriega and, more broadly, for difficulties in *PRO* carrying out covert activities abroad.
A statement issued * by the office of the committee chairman, Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort *PRO* to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama.
The statement added, "Someone has regrettably chosen *PRO*-1 to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government.
Not only does this come close to a violation of law, it violates the trust 0 we have all worked *PRO*-1 to develop *T*-2."
Sen. Boren said, "It's time 0 *PRO* to stop bickering and work together *PRO*-1 to develop a clear and appropriate policy 0 *PRO* to help the country in the future *T*-3 *T*-2.
I've invited the president *PRO*-1 to send his suggestions to the committee."
Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that "a text torn * out of context is a pretext, and it *EXP*-2 is unfair for those in the White House who *T*-1 are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion."
Sen. Boren said 0 the committee couldn't defend itself by *PRO*-1 making the documents public because that would violate classification rules.
But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline wasn't imposed *-1 on the White House by a meddling Congress.
Instead, both congressional and administration officials agreed 0 *?*, it grew out of talks about coup - planning in Panama that *T*-1 were initiated *-3 by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October.
The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations *T*-1.
In fact, yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what *T*-1 had been agreed to *-2.
One administration official said 0 notification was required *-1 even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that *T*-2 seem likely *PRO*-3 to endanger a dictator's life.
But a congressional source close to the panel said 0 the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S. .
Although the notification guideline wasn't carried *-1 out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama.
One senior administration official called the guideline *PRO*-2 "outrageous" and said 0 it could make U.S. operatives reluctant *PRO*-1 to even listen to coup plans for fear 0 they may get into legal trouble.
The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled 0 *?*, partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully *PRO*-2 to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts.
In addition, both administration and congressional officials said 0 the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred *-1 by a White House desire *PRO* to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign.
Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on *T*-1, the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation.
Last week, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that *T*-1 would permit the U.S. more freedom *PRO* to act in coups.
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to blame Congress for restrictions 0 the White House said 0 *T*-3 have hampered its freedom of action.
However, last week Mr. Webster's two top CIA deputies said 0 congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in Panama.
Nevertheless, the administration's criticisms appeared *-1 to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president.
The three men agreed *PRO*-2 to rewrite the guidelines, without *PRO*-3 changing the basic assassination ban, *PRO*-3 to clear up any ambiguities that *T*-1 may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders.
The new argument over the notification guideline, however, could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that *T*-1 existed.

C. Olivetti & Co., *PRO*-1 claiming 0 it has won the race *ICH*-2 in Europe *PRO* to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip, unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday.
The product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp.'s new 32 - bit 486tm microprocessor, which *T*-1 works several times faster than previously available chips.
Hewlett - Packard Co. became the first company world - wide 0 *T*-1 to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month, but it won't start *-2 shipping the computers until early next year.
An Olivetti spokesman said 0 the company's factories are already beginning *-1 to produce the machine, and that it should be available in Europe by December.
"What this means *T*-1 is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do *?*," the spokesman said *T*-2.
The new chip "is a very big step in computing, and it *EXP*-1 is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product," said 0 *T*-2 Patricia Meagher Davis, an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London.
Executives at Olivetti, whose earnings *T*-1 have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years, have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at *PRO*-2 getting new technology to market.
Ms. Davis said 0 the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti's own minicomputers, but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers, stockbrokers and medical doctors.
Although Olivetti's profits tumbled 40% in the first half of this year, she believes 0 Olivetti's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin *-1 to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year, especially if it can fulfill its promise *PRO* to deliver the new machines by December.
"We think 0 the worst is over" in the European information - technology market, she said 0 *T*-1.
Depending on the type of software and peripherals used *, the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals (a role usually filled * by a minicomputer), as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer.
"It's the missing link" in Olivetti's product line between small personal computers and higher - priced minicomputers, the Olivetti spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
He added that Olivetti will continue *-1 making its LSX minicomputer line.
The machines will cost around $16,250 *U* on average in Europe.
The Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second, or MIPS, while Intel's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS.
Olivetti also plans *PRO*-2 to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC / Bunker Ramo unit, which *T*-1 specializes in *PRO*-3 automating bank - branch networks.
Dow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990.
The rates, which *T*-1 take effect Jan. 2, include a 4% increase for national edition advertising.
The Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts.
The increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5% increase in 1989.

"We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without *PRO*-1 substantially increasing our costs.
Fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us *PRO*-1 to share operating efficiencies with our customers."
Advertising rates for the Eastern, Midwest, Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5%, and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5%.
Rates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged.

With investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks, small - lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning, *PRO* making traders believe 0 the market was back to normal.
The Nikkei, which *T*-1 reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening, surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit - taking.
"Investors, especially dealers, don't want *PRO*-1 to hold a position over the weekend," a trader at Dai - ichi Securities said *T*-3, *PRO*-2 adding, though, that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session.
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed * in the First Section, which *T*-1 gained 22.78 points Thursday, was up 14.06 points, or 0.53%, at 2679.72.
The Second Section index, which *T*-1 rose 15.72 points Thursday, was up 11.88 points, or 0.32%, *PRO*-2 to close at 3717.46.
Volume in the second section was estimated *-1 at 30 million shares, up from 28 million Thursday.
In turmoil caused * by the previous Friday's plunge in New York stocks, the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33 - point fall Monday.
But the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8% in value that day compared with Wall Street's far sharper 6.9% drop on Oct. 13.
The Tokyo market's resiliency helped participants *PRO*-3 to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on *PRO*-2 analyzing factors that *T*-1 caused the Friday plunge and realized 0 these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo.
The Nikkei continued *-1 to gain for the rest of the week, *PRO*-1 adding 1017.69 points in four days--more than erasing Monday's losses.
But further major advances on the Nikkei aren't foreseen *-1 this week by market observers.
Investors are still waiting *PRO*-2 to see how the U.S. government will decide on interest rates *T*-3 and how the dollar will be stabilized *-1 *T*-4.
Some high - priced issues made a comeback Friday.
Pioneer surged 450 yen ($3.16 *U*) to 6,050 yen ($42.60 *U*).
Kyocera advanced 80 yen to 5,440.
Fanuc gained 100 to 7,580.
Breweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that *T*-1 could figure in development or other plans, traders said 0 *T*-2.
Sapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070.
Housings, constructions and pharmaceuticals continued *-2 to be bought *-1 following Thursday's gains because of strong earnings outlooks.
Daiwa House gained 50 to 2,660.
Misawa Homes was up 20 at 2,960.
Kajima advanced 40 to 2,120 and Ohbayashi added 50 to 1,730.
Fujisawa added 80 to 2,010 and Mochida advanced 230 to 4,400.
London share prices were influenced *-1 largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound.
The key Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 - share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1, above its intraday low of 2176.9, but off the day's high of 2189.
The index finished 2.4% under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday, although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street's fall.
London was weak throughout Friday's trading, however, on what dealers attributed *T*-1 to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September.
The FT - SE 100 largely remained within an 11 - point range establshed * within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower *T*-1.
The FT 30 - share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0.
Volume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares, the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday's 387.4 million shares.
Dealers said 0 the day's action was featureless outside some response to sterling's early weakness against the mark, and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday.
They added that market - makers were largely sidelined after *PRO*-1 aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest *PRO* to cover internal shortages of FT - SE 100 shares.
Interest may remain limited into tomorrow's U.K. trade figures, which the market will be watching *T*-1 closely *PRO*-2 to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months.
The key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided *PRO*-1 to withdraw from a management - led bid for UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines.
British Airways rose initially after *PRO*-1 announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal.
Dealers said 0 they viewed the initial #390-million *U* ($622 million *U*) outlay for a 15% stake in the airline as a bit much.
Its shares slid in late dealings *PRO*-1 to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence.
The airline was the most active FT - SE 100 at 8.2 million shares traded *.
The next most active top - tier stock was B.A.T Industries, the target of Sir James Goldsmith's #13.4 billion *U* bid.
The company gained shareholder approval *ICH*-1 Thursday 0 *PRO* to restructure in a bid *PRO* to fend off the hostile takeover *T*-2.
Sir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover hadn't changed.
B.A.T ended the day at 778, down 5, on turnover of 7.5 million shares.
Dealers said 0 it was hit *-1 by some profit - taking after gains since mid-week.
In other active shares, Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading, while Hillsdown Holdings, a food products concern, was boosted *-1 2 to 271 after it disclosed 0 it would seek shareholder approval 0 *PRO* to begin share repurchases *T*-2.
Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in Stockholm, Brussels and Milan.
Prices were lower in Frankfurt, Zurich, Paris and Amsterdam.
South African gold stocks closed moderately lower.
Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Taipei, Wellington, Manila, Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Seoul.
Here are *T*-1 price trends on the world's major stock markets, as *PRO* calculated *-2 by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
*PRO* To make them directly comparable, each index is based *-1 on the close of 1969 equaling 100.

Four former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted *-1 of federal charges related * to the Miami - based company's sale of pacemakers, including conspiracy *PRO* to hide pacemaker defects.
Jurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson, a former executive vice president; John Pagones, a former vice president; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin, who *T*-1 had been engineers with Cordis.
Earlier this year, Cordis, a maker of medical devices, agreed *PRO*-1 to plead *PRO*-2 guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $5.7 million *U* in fines and other costs.
Cordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia.
FOX HUNTING HAS been defined *-1 as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible, but at least it's exercise.
At least it has a little dash.
Most of us have *-2 to spend our time on pursuits that *T*-1 afford neither, drab duties rather than pleasures.
Like *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to buy life insurance, for instance, an endeavor notably lacking in dash.
*PRO* Call it *PRO*-1 the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible.
But sooner or later, most of us have *-1 to think about life insurance, just as we often have *-2 to think about *PRO*-3 having root - canal work.
And my time has come.
I'm 33, married, no children, and employed *-1 in *PRO*-2 writing stories like this one.
In times past, life - insurance salesmen targeted heads of household, meaning men, but ours is a two - income family and accustomed *-1 to it.
So if anything happened to me, I'd want *PRO*-1 to leave behind enough so that my 33 - year - old husband would be able *PRO*-2 to pay off the mortgage and some other debts (though not, I admit *?*, enough *PRO* to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury).
*PRO*-2 Figuring that maybe $100,000 to $150,000 *U* would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted *T*-1, I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies--and plunged into a jungle of gibberish.
Over the past decade or two, while I was thinking about fox hunting, the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products, variations on products, and variations on the variations.
Besides term life and whole life (the old standbys), we now have universal life, universal variable life, flexible adjustable universal life, policies with persistency bonuses, policies festooned * with exotic riders, living benefit policies, and on and on.
What *PRO* to do *T*-1?
First, *PRO* generalize.
*PRO*-1 Shorn *-6 of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped *-1 under two broad categories: so - called pure insurance, which *T*-3 amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which *T*-4 provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that *T*-5 can be used *-2 in various ways while the insured is still alive.
If all 0 you want *T*-1 is death - benefit coverage, pure insurance--a term policy--gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits.
It's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought * at the same age.
But "term" means just that; the policy is written *-2 for a specific time period only and must be renewed *-2 when it expires *T*-1.
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal; if you flunk--which *T*-1 means 0 you need insurance more than ever--you may not be able *PRO*-2 to buy it.
Even if you're healthy and can renew, your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older.
So term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks *?*.
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance: policies structured * *PRO*-1 to pay off your mortgage debt, term riders tacked on to permanent insurance, and many others.
One variation that *T*-1 appealed to me at first was the "Money Smart Term Life" policy offered * by Amex Life Insurance Co., the American Express unit, to the parent company's credit - card holders.
Upon examination, however, I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense.
Amex said 0 it would charge me $576 *U* a year for $100,000 *U* of coverage--and would pay me back all the premiums 0 I put *T*-1 in if I canceled the policy after 10 years.
*PRO* Sounds great--or does it *?*?
First, if I canceled, I'd have no more insurance, a not insignificant consideration.
Second, the $5,760 *U* 0 I'd get *T*-3 back would be much diminished *-1 in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation; Amex, not I, would get the benefit of the investment income on my money, income that *T*-2 would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit.
Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would *?* on a straight term policy for the same amount; I'd be paying so heavily *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 just to have the option of *PRO* getting my premiums back that I'd almost have *-3 to cancel *PRO*-3 to make the whole thing worthwhile.
That would be all right with Amex, which *T*-1 could then lock in its investment profit, but it doesn't add up to a "smart money" move for me.
Which *T*-1 goes *PRO*-2 to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else: There is no free lunch, there is only marketing.
And the Second Law, unique to insurance?
If I die early, I win--a hollow victory, since I can't enjoy it--and if I live long, the insurer wins.
Always.
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try *PRO*-2 to sell you permanent insurance, the kind that *T*-1 amasses cash value *T*-3.
The word "death" cannot be escaped *-1 entirely by the industry, but salesmen dodge it wherever possible *T*-4 or cloak it in euphemisms, *PRO*-2 preferring *PRO*-3 to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead.
The implication is that your permanent - insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual - fund account with an added feature.
That is *PRO* gilding the lily.
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle, insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment 0 you might make *T*-1 in the same things 0 the insurance company is putting your money into *T*-2.
That's because you have *-1 to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required * *PRO* to sell and service the whole package.
Again, no free lunch.
This is reflected *-1 in a built - in mortality cost--in effect, your share of the company's estimated liability in *PRO* paying off beneficiaries of people who *T*-2 had the effrontery *PRO* to die while *PRO* under its protection.
And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years, largely because of this.
So *PRO* view permanent insurance for what it is *T*-1--a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment.
The simplest, most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy.
You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage, the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing, and your cash value and dividends grow over the years.
One newer wrinkle, so called single - premium life (you pay for the whole policy at once), has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy "loans," and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment.
Congress closed this loophole last year, or thought 0 it did *?*.
However, Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield, Mass., has developed a "combination plan" of annuity and insurance coverage that it says 0 *T*-1 does not violate the new regulations and that *T*-1 allows policy loans without tax consequences.
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow *T*-1 tax - free is very small.
I'm not prepared in any case *PRO*-1 to put that much money into a policy immediately, so I look into the broad category called * *PRO*-2 universal life.
*PRO*-1 Hugely popular, it is far more flexible than straight whole life.
I can adjust the amount of insurance 0 I want *T*-1 against the amount going into investment; I can pay more or less than the so - called target premium in a given year; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough *PRO* to cover the insurance portion of the policy.
In *PRO*-2 looking at these and other policies, I learn *PRO*-2 to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built * into "policy illustrations"--the rows of numbers that *T*-1 show me the buildup of my cash values over the years.
They commonly give two scenarios: One is based *-1 on interest rates that the company guarantees *T*-2 (usually 4% to 4.5% *U*) and the other on the rate 0 it is currently getting *T*-3 on investment, often 8.5% or more.
*PRO*-1 Projecting the latter over several decades, I find 0 my cash buildup is impressive--but can any high interest rate prevail for that long?
Not likely, I think 0 *PRO* *T*-1.
Also, some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year.
These are not certain, either.
Companies "aren't comfortable *PRO*-1 playing these games, but they realize 0 they're under pressure *PRO* to make their policies look good," says 0 *T*-2 Timothy Pfiefer, an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast, a unit of Towers Perrin Co., the big New York consulting firm.
Another factor 0 *PRO* to consider *T*-1: Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds, and you know how nervous the market has been *T*-2 about those lately.
There are seemingly endless twists to universal life, and it *EXP*-1 pays *PRO* to ask questions about all of them.
At a back - yard barbecue, for example, a friend boasts that she'll only have *-1 to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be "guaranteed *-2."
I call her agent, David Dominici.
Yes, he says 0 *?*, premiums on such variable - rate coverage can be structured *-2 *PRO*-3 to "vanish" after a certain period--but usually only if interest rates stay high enough *PRO* to generate sufficient cash 0 *T*-1 to cover the annual cost of insurance protection.
If interest rates plunge, the insurer may be knocking on my door, *PRO*-1 asking for steeper premium payments 0 *T*-2 to maintain the same amount of protection.
I don't like the sound of that.
Some insurers have also started *-2 offering "persistency bonuses," such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield, if the policy is maintained *-1 for 10 years.
But Glenn Daily, a New York - based financial consultant, warns that many of these bonuses are "just fantasies," because most aren't guaranteed *-1 by the companies.
And the feature is so new, he adds 0 *?*, that no insurer has yet established a track record for *PRO* actually making such payments.
So - called living - benefits provisions also merit a close inspection.
*PRO*-3 Offered *-2 by insurers that *T*-1 include Security - Connecticut Life Insurance Co., Jackson National Life Insurance Co., and National Travelers Life Insurance Co., these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive.
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value *PRO*-1 to pay for long - term care such as nursing - home stays; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer, heart attarcks, renal failure and kidney transplants.
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect *T*-1 are narrowly defined, vary from policy to policy, and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance.
Also, financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes.
And considering the extra cost of such provisions, some figure that people interested in, say, *PRO* paying for extended nursing - home care would be better off *PRO*-2 just buying a separate policy that *T*-1 provides it.
I'm more favorably impressed *-1 by "no - load life," even though it turns out *-2 to be low - load life.
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen; there is still a load--annual administrative fees and initial "setup" charges--but I figure that the lack of commission and of "surrender fees" for *PRO* dropping the policy early still saves me a lot.
I compared one universal policy for $130,000 *U* face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which *T*-1 operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen.
After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $792 *U*, but Id get only $14 *U* from the Equitable.
The difference is magnified *-1 by time, too.
At age 65, when I'd stop *-2 paying premiums *T*-1, the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $14,000 *U* higher than the other, even though the Equitable's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate.
Did I buy it?
Well, not yet.
I'm thinking about *PRO*-1 using the $871 *U* annual premium *PRO*-2 to finance a trip to Paris first.
A person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there--and shop for something more exciting while she's doing it.
Hewlett - Packard Co. will announce today a software program that *T*-1 allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by *PRO* sending the tasks to each other.
*PRO*-2 Called *-1 *PRO*-3 Task Broker, the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired * together.
If a machine has a big computing task, Task Broker asks other computers in the network for "bids" on the job.
It then determines which machine *T*-1 is free *PRO*-2 to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine.
Hewlett - Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast.
The new Hewlett - Packard program, said 0 *?* analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc., a computer - market research company, "is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing."
In today's computer networks, some machines often sit *PRO*-2 idle while others are overtaxed *-1.
With the Hewlett - Packard program, he said 0 *?*, "You get more bang for the buck 0 you've spent *T*-1 on computers."
The program, which *T*-2 will be shipped *-1 in January 1990, runs on the Unix operating system.
Hewlett - Packard will charge $5,000 *U* for a license covering 10 users.
The program now works on all Hewlett - Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made * by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford, Conn.
Hewlett - Packard said 0 it will sell versions *ICH*-2 later next year that *T*-1 run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines.
The Task Broker differs from other programs that *T*-1 spread computing tasks around a network.
A previously available program called * *PRO*-2 Network Computing System, developed * by Hewlett - Packard's Apollo division, for instance, takes a task and splits it up into parts, *PRO*-1 divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing.
But programs in individual computers must be revised *-1 in order *PRO*-1 to work with that system.
Applications won't have *-1 to be rewritten *-3 *PRO*-3 to work with Task Broker, Hewlett - Packard said 0 *?*, and the user of a computer won't be able *PRO*-4 to tell that another machine is doing the work.
The Task Broker "turns that network into--as far as the user is concerned *-1--one giant computer *ICH*-3," said 0 *T*-2 Bill Kay, general manager of Hewlett - Packard's workstation group.
Richard J. Pinola was elected *-1 to the board of this personnel consulting concern, *PRO* increasing its size to nine members.

Shareholders of Messerschmitt - Boelkow - Blohm G.m.b . H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler - Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17.
The owners of the defense and aerospace concern, which *T*-1 include three regional states, several industrial companies and banks, met Friday *PRO*-2 to discuss the final terms of the transaction, in which Daimler - Benz will acquire 50.01% of *T*-3
But agreement aparently couldn't be reached *-1 because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen, which *T*-2 are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region.
The two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB, but their stake will fall to around 30% after Daimler - Benz acquires its stake in the concern.
Jeffrey E. Levin was named *-1 *PRO*-3 vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange.
He had been associate professor in the department of finance at Seton Hall University.
Freight rates, *PRO*-1 declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred * by deregulation, are bottoming out, turning upward and threatening *PRO*-1 to fuel inflation.
Trucking, shipping and air - freight companies have announced rate increases, scheduled * for this fall or early next year, reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport.
Major shippers say 0 they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years.
That's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity, *PRO*-1 helping *PRO* to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad *T*-3.
"Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation, and rates are starting *-2 to move up" at a rate "close to *RNR*-5 or slightly more than *RNR*-5 the inflation rate," said *T*-1 Clifford Sayre, director of logistics at Du Pont Co.
Shippers surveyed * recently by Ohio State University said 0 they expect their freight - transport, storage and distribution costs to rise about 4% this year.
Only 10% of the 250 shippers polled * expected their freight - transport costs to decrease, compared with 30% who *T*-1 had looked to freight transport *PRO*-2 to reduce costs in past years.
"This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad - based upturn in perceived transportation rates *T*-2," said *T*-1 Bernard LaLonde, a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus.
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that *T*-1 began in 1980 enabled shippers *PRO*-2 to bargain for transportation.
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently, *PRO* leading to overcapacity 0 they were eager *PRO*-2 to fill *T*-1.
Shippers cut about $35 billion *U* from their annual, inter-city truck and rail costs, to about $150 billion *U*, or about 6.4% of gross national product, down from 8% of GNP in 1981.
But with much of the inefficiency squeezed * out of the freight - transport system, rising costs are likely *-2 to be reflected *-1 directly in higher freight rates.
"Shippers are saying ` the party's over,"' said *T*-1 Mr. LaLonde.
"Shippers won't be able *PRO*-1 to look for transportation - cost savings as they have *?* for the last eight or nine years.
Transport rates won't be an opportunity for *PRO* offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy."
Robert Delaney, a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said "We've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight - cost reductions.
Now we are starting *-1 to see real freight - rate increases as carriers replace equipment, pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor.
You'll see carriers try *PRO*-2 to recoup some of the price cutting that *T*-1 occurred previously."
Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers.
"There's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck," said *T*-1 Gerard McCullough, lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Less - than - truckload companies, which *T*-1 carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer, discounted away a 4.7% rate increase implemented * last April.
The carriers were competing fiercely for market share.
Railroad - rate increases are likely *-2 to be restrained *-1 by weakening rail - traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks.
An official at Consolidated Freightways Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif., less - than - truckload carrier, said 0 rate discounting in that industry has begun *-1 to "stabilize."
Consolidated Freightways plans *PRO*-1 to raise its rates 5.3% late this year or early next year, and at least two competitors have announced similar increases.
Truckers are "trying *PRO*-1 to send signals that they need *-2 to stop the bloodletting, forget about market share and go for higher rates," said 0 *T*-3 Michael Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Bros.
And "shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can *?*," he said 0 *T*-1.
Air - freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20% earlier this month.
And Japan Air Lines said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to boost its rates a further 25% over the next two years.
Such rate increases "will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports," said 0 *T*-1 Richard Connors, a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc., the U.S. air - freight - forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan.
Ship companies carrying bulk commodities, such as oil, grain, coal and iron ore, have been able *PRO*-1 to increase their rates in the last couple of years.
Some bulk shipping rates have increased "3% to 4% *U* in the past few months," said 0 *T*-1 Salomon's Mr. Lloyd.
And ship lines carrying containers are also trying *PRO*-1 to raise their rates.
Carriers boosted rates *ICH*-1 more than 10% in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September, *PRO*-2 hoping *PRO*-3 to partly restore rates to earlier levels.
Ship lines operating in the Pacific plan *PRO*-1 to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10%, *PRO* effective next April.
Lep Group PLC of Britain, which *T*-1 holds a 62.42% stake in Profit Systems Inc., said 0 it is considering courses of action that *T*-2 could result in its having "active control" of the company.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lep Group said 0 a possible course of action may include *PRO* acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares 0 it doesn't already own *T*-1.
It noted, however, that it hasn't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction.
Lep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares, or 62.42%, the filing said 0 *T*-1.
Profit Systems, Valley Stream, N.Y., is an air freight forwarding concern.
Prices for seats on the New York Stock Exchange are recovering a bit after *PRO*-1 hitting a four - year low earlier this month.
Two seats on the Big Board were sold *-1 yesterday for $455,000 *U*, and then $500,000 *U*.
The previous sale was $436,000 *U* on Oct. 17; the last time 0 prices were that low *T*-1 was November 1985, when a seat sold for $425,000 *U* *T*-2.

Seats are currently quoted *-1 at $430,000 *U* bid * and $525,000 *U* asked *.
Confidence in the pound is widely expected *-1 to take another sharp dive if trade figures for September, due for release tomorrow, fail *-2 to show a substantial improvement from July and August's near - record deficits.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped *PRO* to prevent a freefall in sterling over the past week.
But analysts reckon 0 underlying support for sterling has been eroded *-1 by the chancellor's failure *PRO* to announce any new policy measures in his Mansion House speech last Thursday.
This has increased the risk of the government being forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to increase base rates to 16% from their current 15% level *PRO*-4 to defend the pound, economists and foreign exchange market analysts say 0 *T*-3.
"The risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side," said *T*-1 Chris Dillow, senior U.K. economist at Nomura Research Institute.
"If there is another bad trade number, there could be an awful lot of pressure," noted *T*-1 Simon Briscoe, U.K. economist for Midland Montagu, a unit of Midland Bank PLC.
Forecasts for the trade figures range widely, but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the #2 billion *U* ($3.2 billion *U*) deficit in the current account reported * for August.
The August deficit and the #2.2 billion *U* gap registered * in July are topped *-1 only by the #2.3 billion *U* deficit of October 1988.
Sanjay Joshi, European economist at Baring Brothers & Co., said 0 there is no sign that Britain's manufacturing industry is transforming itself *PRO*-1 to boost exports.
At the same time, he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports, given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows.
He reckons 0 the current account deficit will narrow to only #1.8 billion *U* in September.
However, Mr. Dillow said 0 he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports.
Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August's unexpected decline, the deficit could narrow to as little as #1.3 billion *U*.
Mr. Briscoe, who *T*-1 also forecasts a #1.3 billion *U* current account gap, warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling, the currency won't advance much because investors will want *PRO*-2 to see further evidence of the turnaround before *PRO*-3 adjusting positions.
Nevertheless, he noted 0 *?*, "No one will want *PRO*-2 to go into the trade figures without a flat position" in the pound.
Meanwhile, overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded.
In his Mansion House speech, Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected *-1 as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect.
U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years.
But consumer expenditure data released * Friday don't suggest that the U.K. economy is slowing that quickly.
The figures show that spending rose 0.1% in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up 3.8% from a year ago.
This compares with a 1.6% rise in the second from the first quarter and a 5.4% increase from the second quarter of 1988.
Mr. Dillow said 0 the data show 0 the economy "is still quite strong," but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises.
Certainly, the chancellor has made it *EXP*-1 clear that he is prepared *PRO*-2 to increase interest rates again if necessary *PRO*-3 to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling doesn't decline further.
Thursday, he reminded his audience that the government "cannot allow the necessary rigor of monetary policy to be undermined *-1 by exchange rate weakness."
Analysts agree 0 there is little holding sterling firm *ICH*-2 at the moment other than Mr. Lawson's promise that rates will be pushed *-1 higher if necessary.
And, they warn 0 *?*, any further drop in the government's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow.
Sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson's promise Friday.
In European trading it declined to $1.5890 *U* and 2.9495 marks from $1.5940 *U* and 2.9429 marks late Thursday.
Economists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks, the government will be forced *-1 *PRO*-4 to increase rates to 16%, *PRO*-3 both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged.
Friday's Market Activity
The dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated.
Foreign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun *-2 to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange, which *T*-1 has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points *T*-3.
Currency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals, *PRO*-1 keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve.
Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8578 marks, up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen, up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday.
In Tokyo on Monday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 141.35 yen.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.30 *U* an ounce, up 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted *-1 at $366.50 *U* an ounce.
Nelson Bunker Hunt's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal.
Silver, now trading around $5 *U* an ounce, surged to an all - time peak of $50 *U* an ounce in January 1980 from around $9 *U* in mid-1979.
"Mr. Hunt's attempt *PRO* to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly *PRO*-2 to blame *-3 for today's market depression," says *T*-1 Lesley Edgar, managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd., London bullion brokers.
While some 100 million ounces of silver once held * by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore, the price surge of 1979 - 80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers *PRO*-81 to economize on silver use, Mr. Edgar says 0 *T*-2.
Photographic developers, for example, bought equipment 0 *PRO* to recover silver from spent photographs, negatives and processing solutions *T*-1.
Meanwhile, the photographic industry, which *T*-1 accounts for 44% of silver consumption, continues *-2 to look for substitutes.
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning *-2 to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that *T*-1 don't require silver, dealers say 0 *T*-3.
Silver's history of volatility is also discouraging investors, dealers say 0 *T*-1.
Even in the present uncertain investment climate, investors are preferring "quality assets" such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold, silver and platinum, dealers say 0 *T*-1.
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar, precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination *ICH*-1 by industrial nations *PRO* to curb inflation, dealers say 0 *T*-2.
Silver, however is in a deeper slump than are *?* gold and platinum.
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen * in the mid-1970s.
"Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals," says *T*-1 Frederick R. Demler, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S., he says 0 *T*-1.
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver, while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union.
Silver prices could also be boosted *-1 by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico, Mr. Demler says 0 *T*-2.
Meanwhile, total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row, he says 0 *T*-1.
Japanese demand grew by 70% in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that *T*-1 will require 4.5 million ounces.
Compared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s, world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance, Mr. Demler says 0 *T*-1.
Despite intermittent rallies in the past few years, improvements in the supply - demand balance haven't managed *PRO*-1 to push silver prices into a higher range.
"There's just too much silver around," says *T*-1 Tom Butler, an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co., a London bullion house.
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges, refiners, consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant, says 0 *T*-1 Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report.
This year alone, inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped "by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces" because of producer deliveries, de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors, says 0 *T*-1 Rhona O'Connell, London - based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
"Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend," Ms. O'Connell says *T*-1.
Moreover, while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help *PRO* underpin its price, silver doesn't have the same mystique, dealers say 0 *T*-1.
Investors have gotten burned *-2 on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold, says 0 *T*-1 Urs Seiler, senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland.
Yet if gold prices improve, silver prices could rally sharply, he says 0 *T*-1.
However, dealers caution that any increase would be $1 to $2 *U* at most.
*PRO* Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
Livestock and Meats
Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that *T*-1 found fewer - than - *PRO* expected *-2 cattle on feedlots.
After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle *ICH*-1 on Oct. 1, down 6% from that date a year earlier.
Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4% decline.
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter, so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef.
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed * on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5% compared with the year - earlier quarter.
Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3% decline in placements for the quarter.
In the 1988 quarter, many farmers were forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches.
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because *PRO* fattening cattle is less profitable.
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy *?*.
The Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered * in the quarter dropped by 5% from the 1988 quarter, which *T*-1 was in line with projections by analysts.
Energy
Friday's 44 - cent - a - barrel price drop to $19.98 *U* in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated * with the contract's going off the board.
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that *T*-1's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions.
Barring any petroleum - related news events, trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections *ICH*-1 by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth - quarter demand will keep prices *PRO*-2 firm.
Copper
Copper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon.
For example, copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $1.2345 *U* a pound.
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long - term strikes.
On Friday, one analyst said 0 *?*, rank - and - file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three - month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia.
In Mexico, the analyst added 0 *?*, employees at the Cananea mine, who *T*-2 have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared *-1 bankrupt by the government *T*-3, accepted a 35% cut in the 3,800 - man work force.
The mine is expected *-1 to return to production in about a week.
On Friday, selling dominated the afternoon "curb" session in London, which *T*-1 takes place at noon EDT.
The premium of cash copper to the three - month forward offerings narrowed, *PRO* indicating weaker demand for cash copper.
Long - term support for the December contract was believed *-1 to be at $1.25 *U* a pound.
A technical analyst said 0 there were a number of * stop - loss orders under that level that *T*-1 were touched *-2 off when the contract's price fell below it *T*-3.
That brought in considerable fund selling, which *T*-1 continued until the close of trading.
"In general, it was a bearish close," said *T*-1 Ben Hanauer, a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co., a major commodities trading and brokerage firm.
But whether this price break has implications for this week, he said 0 *?*, "we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released *-1 Monday morning *T*-3."
Another analyst said 0 he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued *-1 *T*-2.
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said that when traders saw 0 the market wasn't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks *T*-1, they perceived a bearish sign.
He also noted that the Japanese, who *T*-1 had been buying at prices just above the $1.25 *U* level, apparently pulled back from the market on Friday.
Mr. Savaiko said 0 he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $1.05 *U* a pound.
Bob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination.
Mr. Stone thought 0 the discipline was unfair; he believed that his manager wanted *PRO*-1 to get rid of him for personal reasons.
*PRO*-1 Unable *PRO*-2 to persuade the manager *PRO*-3 to change his decision, he went to a "company court" for a hearing.
At the scheduled time, Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked *T*-1.
After the three members of the court introduced themselves, the chairman of the panel said: "*PRO* Go ahead and tell us what *T*-1 happened.
We may ask questions as you go along, or we may wait until the end."
No lawyers or tape recorders were present.
The only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists, one of whom *T*-1 knew Mr. Stone's case intimately and would help *PRO* fill in any facts needed * *PRO* to give the court the full picture.
Over a cup of coffee, Mr. Stone told his story.
He talked about 20 minutes.
When he was through *T*-1, the court members asked many questions, then the chairman said 0 they would like *PRO*-2 to hear his manager's side and talk to witnesses.
The chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks.
Bob Stone is a fictional name, but the incident described * is real.
It happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles.
The court is called *-1 *PRO*-3 the Management Appeals Committee, or just "MAC," and it is likely *-2 to hear a couple of dozen cases a year.
*PRO* Alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis, the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis, a General Electric plant in Columbia, Md., or a number of other companies.
These firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world: the rise of what I call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 corporate due process.
Although corporate due process is practiced *-1 today in few companies--perhaps 40 to 60--it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry.
In the coming decade a majority of people - oriented companies are likely *-1 to adopt it.
Corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons.
It reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees, with all 0 that means *T*-1 for reduced legal costs and better public relations.
It helps *PRO* to keep out unions.
It increases employee commitment to the company, with all 0 that means *T*-1 for efficiency and quality control.
What must your management team do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to establish corporate due process?
Here are *T*-1 four key steps:
1 . *PRO* Make sure 0 you have a strong personnel department.
It must be able *PRO*-3 to handle most of the complaints that *T*-4 cannot be solved *-1 in the trenches by managers and their subordinates, else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated *-2 with cases.
At Polaroid, the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved *-1 at earlier stages.
At TWA, the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year, only a fraction of the complaints brought * to personnel specialists.
At Citicorp, the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel's skill in complaint - resolution.
In a typical year, up to 20% of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment.
In a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel 0 *T*-1 to handle *?*.
2 . Formally or informally, *PRO* train all your managers and supervisors in the company's due - process approach.
*PRO* See that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards, for it is the "law" governing company courts and adjudicators.
*PRO* Coach them in *PRO* handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately.
In case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator, *PRO* teach managers *PRO*-1 to accept reversals as a fact of business life, for in a good due - process system they are bound *-2 to happen.
In the 15 companies 0 I studied *T*-1, reversal rates range on the average from 20% to 40%.
3 . *PRO* Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator.
A panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and, for the panelists, mutual support.
An adjudicator system--that is, an investigator who *T*-1 acts first as a fact - finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts--has such advantages as speed, flexibility and maximum privacy.
International Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single - adjudicator approach.
4 . *PRO* Make your due - process system visible.
It won't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it.
Most managements hesitate *PRO*-1 to go all out in *PRO*-2 advertising their due - process systems for fear of *PRO* encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads *PRO*-3 to file complaints.
On the other hand, they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described *-1 in their employee handbooks and talked *-1 up by personnel specialists.
Smith - Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed - circuit TV programs.
Naturally, one of the best ways 0 *PRO* to guarantee visibility for your due - process system *T*-1 is for top management to support it.
At IBM, the company's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive.
Federal Express goes further *ICH*-1 in this respect than any company 0 I know of *T*-2 with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale, chief executive and chief operating officer, respectively, sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday *PRO*-3 to decide cases.
Mr. Ewing is a consultant based * in Winchester, Mass., and author of "Justice on the Job: *PRO* Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace" (Harvard Business School Press, 1989).
If you think 0 you have stress - related problems on the job, there's good news and bad news.
You're probably right, and you aren't alone.
A new Gallup Poll study commissioned * by the New York Business Group on Health, found that a full 25% of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress - related illness, with about 13% suffering from depression.
The study surveyed a national group of medical directors, personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies.
It is one of a series of studies on health commissioned * by the New York Business Group, a non-profit organization with about 300 members.
The stress study was undertaken *-1 because problems related to stress "are much more prevalent than they seem *?*," said 0 *T*-2 Leon J. Warshaw, executive director of the business group.
In *PRO*-1 presenting the study late last week, Dr. Warshaw estimated 0 the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial.
Occupational disability related to anxiety, depression and stress costs about $8,000 *U* a case in terms of worker's compensation.
In terms of days lost * on the job, the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress, anxiety or depression.
He added that the cost for stress - related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims.
"We hope *PRO*-1 to sensitize employers" *PRO*-3 to recognize the problems so they can do something about them, Dr. Warshaw said 0 *T*-2.
Early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long - term expense associated * with hospitalization, which *T*-1 sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long *T*-2.
Even the courts are beginning *-1 to recognize the link between jobs and stress - related disorders in compensation cases, according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance.
But although 56% of the respondents in the study indicated that mental - health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace, there is still a social stigma associated * with people seeking help.
The disorders, which 20 years ago *T*-2 struck middle - age and older people, "now strike people at the height of productivity," says 0 *T*-3 Robert M.A. Hirschfeld, of the National Institute of Mental Health, who *T*-1 spoke at the presentation of the study's findings.
The poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager's view of the problem, with 65% of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying 0 stress - related problems were "fairly pervasive" and 55% of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing.
The poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress - producing event in larger companies.
More than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress - provoking situation in their company.
Mid-sized companies were most affected *-1 by talk of layoffs or plant closings.
The study, which *T*-1 received funding from Upjohn Co., which *T*-2 makes several drugs 0 *T*-3 to treat stress - related illnesses, also found 0 47% of the managers said 0 stress, anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production.
Alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress - related problems was cited *-1 by 30% of those polled *.
Although Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses, "stress perceived *PRO* to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that *T*-1 may contribute to burnout."
He also noted that various work environments, such as night work, have their own "stressors."
"We all like stress, but there's a limit," says *T*-1 Paul D'Arcy, of Rohrer, Hibler & Replogle, a corporate psychology and management consulting firm.
The problem, says 0 *?* Mr. D'Arcy, a psychologist, is that "it *EXP*-2's very hard *PRO* to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance *T*-3.
HomeFed Corp. said 0 its main subsidiary, Home Federal Savings & Loan, converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank.
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday, HomeFed said 0 *T*-1.
The change in charter doesn't alter the federal insurance of deposits, federal regulatory powers or company operations, a spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
When Rune Andersson set out *PRO*-2 to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s *T*-1, he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants.
"All these consultants kept coming around *PRO*-1 telling us 0 we should concentrate on high technology, electronics or biotechnology, and get out of mature basic industries," Mr. Andersson recalls *T*-2.
Yet under its 45 - year - old president, Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries--first *PRO*-1 strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division, later adding mining as well as building and construction materials.
It was a gutsy move for a little - known executive, fired * after only two months as president of his previous company.
But *PRO* going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson.
*PRO*-1 Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview, the diminutive Swede quips: "It turned out *-2 to be lucky for us.
If the whole market thinks 0 what you're doing *T*-1 is crazy you don't have much competition."
Mr. Andersson is anxious *PRO*-1 to strengthen Trelleborg's balance sheet.
Characteristically, he didn't waste much time *PRO*-1 getting started *-2.
On Tuesday, Trelleborg's directors announced plans *PRO* to spin off two big divisions--minerals processing, and building and distribution--as separately quoted companies on Stockholm's Stock Exchange.
At current market prices, the twin public offerings 0 *T*-2 to be completed *-1 next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor ($386 million *U*) to Trelleborg's coffers, analysts say 0 *T*-3.
The board had also been expected *-1 to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares.
But that share issue--intended * to make Trelleborg better known among international investors--was postponed *-1 until market conditions stabilize, people familiar with the situation say 0 *T*-2.
Trelleborg's internationally traded "Bfree" series stock plunged SKr29 ($4.48 *U*) to SKr205 ($31.65 *U*) in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm.
Tuesday, the shares regained SKr20, *PRO*-1 closing at SKr225.
Mr. Andersson says 0 he is confident that *PRO* taking parts of the company *PRO*-2 public will help *PRO* erase the "conglomerate stigma" that *T*-1 has held down Trelleborg's share price.
Trelleborg plans *PRO*-1 to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50% of both units.
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent.
A family foundation set * up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59% of Trelleborg's voting shares outstanding.
But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold *-1 in the open market if control drops below 50%.
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings 0 *T*-1 to finance Trelleborg's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation's holding.
That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson's shopping spree, during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years *T*-1.
Most of the new additions were barely profitable, if not outright loss makers.
*PRO*-1 Applying prowess gained * during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux, Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood--and got quick results.
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia's biggest and fastest - growing industrial concerns.
Between 1985 and 1988, sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold.
Many analysts expect Mr. Andersson, who *T*-2 owns 1.7% of the company, to be named *-1 *PRO*-4 Trelleborg's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year *T*-3.
But the promotion isn't likely *-2 to alter a management style 0 Mr. Andersson describes *T*-1 as "*PRO* being the driving force leading the troops, not managing by *PRO*-3 sitting back with a cigar *PRO*-4 waiting for people to bring me ideas."
Last month, in his boldest move yet, Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada's Noranda Inc. in a joint $2 billion *U* hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern, Falconbridge Ltd.
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world - class mining concern.
"Trelleborg isn't in the same league *ICH*-2 yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo - American Corp.," says *T*-1 Mike Kurtanjek, a mining analyst at James Capel & Co., London.
"But we certainly like what we've seen *T*-1 so far."
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles.
Mr. Andersson acknowledges that the company's mining division "will be busy for a while *PRO*-1 digesting its recent expansion."
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg's recent profit surge, *PRO*-1 raising mining's share of pretax profit to 68% this year from a big loss two years earlier.
But analysts caution 0 an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth.
Mining is likely *-1 to remain Trelleborg's main business.
Analysts say 0 its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages *PRO*-2 to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture *T*-1.
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to *PRO* winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid.
Some analysts say 0 Noranda would prefer *PRO*-1 to break up Falconbridge, and that the Swedes--relatively inexperienced in international mining operations--could have problems *PRO*-2 holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf.
Mr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda haven't discussed a Falconbridge break - up.
Falconbridge, he says 0 *?*, will continue *-2 operating in its current form.
"We'd be reluctant *PRO*-1 to accept 50 - 50 ownership in a manufacturing company.
But such partnerships are common in mining, where there aren't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner *T*-1," Trelleborg's president says *T*-2.
*PRO* Perhaps more important, both companies share Mr. Andersson's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries.
"If the 1980s were a decade of consumption, the '90s will be the investment decade," Mr. Andersson says *T*-1.
"The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment," he says *T*-1.
"That's beginning *-1 to change.
And investment is the key word for base metals, and most other businesses 0 Trelleborg is in *T*-1.
Terry L. Haines, formerly general manager of Canadian operations, was elected *-1 to the new position of vice president, North American sales, of this plastics concern.
Also, Larry A. Kushkin, executive vice president, North American operations, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 head of the company's international automotive operations, another new position.
He remains an executive vice president, the company said 0 *?*, and his new position reflects "the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman's high performance plastic materials."
Gordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations, and Mr. Kushkin's former position isn't being filled *-1 at this time, the company said 0 *T*-2.
IN *PRO* SIZING UP the risks of stock - market investments, there's probably no starting place better than "beta."
But investors better not ignore its limitations, either.
Beta is a handy gauge that *T*-1 measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund.
For any given move in the overall market, it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall *T*-1.
Beta figures are widely available and easy 0 *PRO* to interpret *T*-1.
The beta of the broad market, typically defined * as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0.
So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on.
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that *T*-1 have low betas.
*PRO* Go with high - beta stocks *PRO*-1 to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market.
*PRO* Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations.
"Beta is only part of the risk in a stock," says *T*-2 William F. Sharpe, the Stanford University emeritus professor who *T*-1 developed the measure.
"There is risk that *T*-1 is not associated *-2 with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that."
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company - and industry - specific risk associated * with an individual stock.
That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks, but it virtually disappears in a large and well - diversified portfolio.
Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that *T*-1 march to their own drummer.
In particular, the prices of gold and other precious - metals stocks shoot up and down, but the stocks tend *-1 to have low betas because their moves are not market - inspired.
Concern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors *PRO*-1 to eliminate beta figures for precious - metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual - fund guide.
"Our fear was 0 people would look just at the beta {of a gold fund} and say 0 here is *T*-1 an investment with very low risk," says John Markese, director of research for the Chicago - based group.
"In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements.
Alusuisse of America Inc. plans *PRO*-1 to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy *PRO* to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. .
Alusuisse, of New York, declined *PRO*-1 to say how much it expects *PRO*-2 to get *T*-3 for the unit; the company has hired First Boston Corp. *PRO*-4 to help identify bidders.
Alusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd., a Zurich, Switzerland, producer of aluminum, chemicals and packaging products.
Consolidated, which *T*-1 had 1988 revenue of $400 million *U*, makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal, Ohio, and Jackson, Tenn., rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run, W.Va.
CalMat Co. said 0 it completed a $32.8 million *U* sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $12 million *U*.

Social Security benefits will rise 4.7% next year *PRO*-1 to keep pace with inflation, *PRO*-1 boosting the average monthly benefit to $566 *U* from $541 *U*, the Department of Health and Human Services announced 0 *T*-2.
The higher payments will start with Social Security checks received * on Jan. 3, 1990.
Supplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7%, starting with checks received * on Dec. 29, 1988, *PRO* increasing the maximum SSI payment to $386 *U* from $368 *U* a month.
The inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that *T*-1 generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $50,400 *U* in 1990 from $48,000 *U* this year.
As *PRO* mandated *-1 by law, the tax rate will rise to 7.65% in 1990 from 7.51% and won't rise any further in the future.
This means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid * by workers and employers each will rise $250.80 *U* next year to $3,855.60 *U*.
Beneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able *PRO*-1 to earn $9,360 *U* *ICH*-3 without *PRO*-2 losing any Social Security benefits in 1990, up from $8,880 *U* this year.
The exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to $6,840 *U* from $6,480 *U*.
The adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year.
YOU WENT to college and thought 0 you got an education.
Now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson: How *PRO* to send your kids to college *T*-1.
*PRO* True, when you went to college *T*-1, there wasn't that much 0 *PRO* to learn *T*-2.
*PRO* Stick some money in an interest - bearing account and watch it grow.
Now, investment salesmen say 0 it's time 0 *PRO* to take some risks *T*-2 if you want the kind of returns that *T*-1 will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years.
In short, *PRO* throw away the passbook and go for the glory.
The reason is cost.
Nothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s.
Tuitions at private colleges rose 154% in the 10 years ended in June of this year; that's twice the 77% increase in consumer prices for the same period.
A year at Harvard now goes for $19,395 *U*.
By 2007, when this year's newborns hit campus *T*-1, a four - year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $300,000 *U*, give or take a few pizzas - with - everything at exam time.
Stanford, MIT and other utmosts will cost no less.
So what's a parent to do *T*-1?
Some investment advisers are suggesting, in effect, a bet on a start - up investment pool--maybe even on margin.
Others prefer deep - discount zero - coupon bonds.
Still others say, Why *PRO* not take a chance on a high - octane growth fund *T*-1?
"You're not going *-2 to make it in a 5% bank account," says *T*-1 James Riepe, director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price.
*PRO*-1 To get the necessary growth, adds 0 *?* Murray Ruffel, a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual - fund group, "you need *-1 to go to the stock market."
In other words, a little volatility never hurt.
It never hurt anyone, that is, unless the growth funds don't grow when you need them to *?* *T*-1.
Or the zero - coupon bonds turn out *-1 not to have been discounted *-2 deeply enough *PRO* to pay your kid's tuition.
That's the dilemma for today's parent.
Although many experts are advising risk, no one has a good answer for you if the risk doesn't pay off.
Help may be on the way.
The antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools.
Fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s.
And then there's always State U.
But parents' craving for a top - rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine.
*PRO*-1 Belatedly aware of public concern, lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime *PRO*-1 to create and sell college savings and investment schemes.
Their message, explicit or implicit, is that a good college will cost so much *ICH*-2 by whenever you want it *T*-1 that the tried and true won't do anymore.
*PRO* Forget about Treasury bills or a money - market fund.
The latest wave of marketing is instructive.
Several outfits--including the Financial Programs, Franklin, and T. Rowe Price mutual - fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house--are advertising "college planner" tables and charts that *T*-1 tell you how much you need *-2 to put *T*-3 aside regularly.
The calculations generally rely on an after - tax rate of return of 8% annually--a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place, the stock market.
Most of the mailers are free, but Denver - based Financial Programs sells, for $15 *U*, a version customized * to the age of the child and the college of choice.
The figures are shocking.
*PRO*-2 To build a nest egg that *T*-1 would pay for Stanford when a current first - grader reaches college age *T*-3, parents would need *-2 to set aside $773.94 *U* a month--for 12 years.
They can cut this to $691.09 *U* a month if the investing keeps up through college.
And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier--when mother and child come home from the hospital *T*-1.
*PRO* Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still doesn't generate an installment 0 most people can live with *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Using a recent average private - school cost of about $12,500 *U* a year, T. Rowe Price's planner prescribes $450 *U* monthly if the plan begins when the child is six *T*-2.
Since the formula assumes an 8% before - tax return in a mutual fund, there would also be $16,500 *U* in taxes 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-1 over the 12 years.
Not everyone is so pessimistic.
"People are basically peddling a lot of fear," says *T*-1 Arthur Hauptman, a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington.
He takes issue with projections that *T*-1 don't factor in students' own contribution, which *T*-2 reduces most parents' burden substantially.
Still, he says 0 *?*, "it's no bad thing" if all the marketing prods people into *PRO*-2 putting aside a little more.
"The situation 0 you want *PRO*-1 to avoid *T*-2 is *PRO* having somebody not save anything and hope 0 they'll be able *PRO*-4 to do it out of current income," he says *T*-3.
"That's crazy."
His advice: *PRO* Don't panic.
Parents, he says 0 *?*, should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford *T*-2.
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest *T*-1 might be a good goal, he adds 0 *T*-2.
That way, parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time *ICH*-3 comes 0 *PRO* to pay tuition *T*-2 *T*-1.
Mr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed *-1 and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages.
He favors either an all - stock fund or a balanced fund that *T*-1 mixes both stocks and bonds.
In their anxiety, however, parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes.
They have laid out about $1 billion *U* for so - called baccalaureate zero - coupon municipal bonds--so far offered * by Connecticut, Illinois, Virginia and eight other states.
And they have bought about $500 million *U* in prepaid - tuition plans, offered * in Michigan, Florida and Wyoming.
The prepaid plans take payment *ICH*-2 today--usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount--for a promise that tuition will be covered *-1 tomorrow.
The baccalaureate bonds--tax - free, offered * in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they won't be called *-1 before maturity--seem *-2 to be tailor - made for college savers.
Like other zeros, they pay all their interest at maturity, *PRO* meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school *T*-1.
Their compounding effect is also alluring.
In June, Virginia sold bonds for $268.98 *U* that *T*-1 will pay $1,000 *U* in 2009.
But Richard Anderson, head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives, at Columbia University, a research group partly financed * by the federal government, says 0 zeros are particularly ill - suited.
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up *T*-1.
That won't matter if they are held *-1 to maturity, but if, for any reason, the parents need *-2 to sell them before then, there could be a severe loss of principal.
Had zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years' tuition at the time, *PRO*-2 aiming for their children's 1988 enrollment, they would have been left *-3 with only enough *PRO* to pay for two years, Mr. Anderson figures 0 *T*-1.
Most other bonds, however, would probably not have fared much better.
The prepaid plans may be a good bet, provided 0 the guarantee of future tuition is secure.
Issuing states generally limit the guarantees to in - state institutions, however, and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children don't attend the specified schools.
Two private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that *T*-1 could be more broadly transferable.
Mr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan.
The issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee.
Prepayments, much like mutual - fund purchases, are pooled *-1 for investment.
Sponsors are naturally counting on their ability *PRO* to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns.
But buyers are essentially betting on a start - up investment fund with no track record--and some have been encouraged *-1 *PRO*-3 to borrow *PRO*-2 to do so.
One problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors' funds are taxable.
The colleges, as educational institutions, had hoped 0 that wouldn't be the case.
Based on historical rates of return, Mr. Anderson reckons 0 a 100% stock portfolio, indexed * to the market, would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century.
But sponsors might not pick the stocks that *T*-1 will match the market.
And they're leaning more toward fixed income, whose returns after tax *T*-1 have trailed tuition increases.
"I'm not sure 0 they're going *-2 to make it work," says *T*-1 Mr. Anderson.
What *T*-1 happens if the sponsors don't have the cash 0 *T*-2 to pay the tuitions?
Florida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments, *PRO* meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack.
Not so Michigan.
Its plan is set *-1 up as an independent agency.
The state says 0 there's no worry--investment returns, combined * with fees and the gains from unused plans, will provide all the cash 0 it needs *T*-1.

Guillermo Ortiz's Sept. 15 Americas column, "Mexico's Been Bitten *-2 by the Privatization Bug," is a refreshingly clear statement of his government's commitment to privatization, and must be welcomed *-3 as such by all Americans who *T*-1 wish his country well.
The Mexico - United States Institute is glad *PRO*-1 to see such a high official as Mexico's undersecretary of finance view his country's reforms "in the context of a larger, world - wide process" of profound change toward free - market economics, especially in the statist countries.
*PRO*-1 Having said that, we must caution against an apparent tendency *PRO* to overstate the case.
It *EXP*-1 is not quite true, for example, that the Mexican government has "privatized" Mexicana de Aviacion, as Mr. Ortiz claims 0 *?*.
In the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40% of the total equity of the airline *T*-1.
How can a company be considered *-1 "privatized" if the state is so heavily represented *-2 in it *T*-3?
(True, the Mexican government has granted "control" over the airline to a new private consortium, but its propensity *PRO* to take back what it gives *T*-1 is too well known 0 *T*-2 to permit one *PRO*-3 to be sanguine.)
Regrettably, too, Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar "numbers game" when he boasts that "fewer than 392 {state enterprises} *ICH*-2 currently remain in the public sector," down from the "1,155 public entities that *T*-1 existed in 1982 *T*-3.
" But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico; indeed, they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure.
I refer essentially to petroleum, electric power, banking and newsprint.
Those enterprises, however, are not going *-2 to be privatized *-1.
They are officially considered *-2 "strategic," and their privatization is prohibited *-1 by the Mexican Constitution.
In language that *T*-1 sidesteps the issue, Mr. Ortiz writes 0, "The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas's plan *PRO* to modernize Mexico's economy...."
Yet clearly, modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said *-1 to have caught the "privatization bug."
The bottom line, however, is not economic but political reform.
A long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to *T*-1, without *PRO*-2 having *-3 to answer to the public.
*PRO*-3 To guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized *-1, Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that *T*-2 will ensure democracy and hence accountability.

Price wars between the fast - food giants are starting *-1 to clobber the fast - food little guys: the franchisees.
"When elephants start *-1 fighting *T*-2, ants get killed *-3," says *T*-4 Murray Riese, co-owner of National Restaurants, a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut, Roy Rogers and other chains.
As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another, franchisers are struggling desperately for market share, *PRO*-1 slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions.
The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many, *PRO*-1 threatening *PRO*-2 to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast - food chains and their franchisees.
The chains "used *-1 to offer discounts during winter when business was slow *T*-2, but in the last year or so, discounting has become a 12 - month thing," says 0 *T*-3 Donald Harty, president of Charisma Group Inc., a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC's Burger King chain.
Though Charisma's sales are up slightly this year, Mr. Harty says 0 profits will be flat or lower.
And Bill Konopnicki, a Safford, Ariz., licensee of McDonald's Corp. who *T*-1 is chairman of the company's National Operators Advisory Board, says 0 some fast - food outlets "could be in serious trouble, based on the amount of discounting that *T*-2 seems *-3 to be going on."
Until recently, the huge fast - food industry, with sales of about $60.1 billion *U* last year, kept price - skirmishing to a minimum.
But early this year, PepsiCo Inc.'s Taco Bell unit and Wendy's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions, says 0 *T*-1 John Rohs, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co.
That brought a chain reaction in the industry.
The situation was further aggravated *-1 early this month, when McDonald's set plans *PRO* to heat up the discounting by *PRO*-3 offering coupons *T*-2.
It also decided *PRO*-1 to go national with pizza, which it has been test - marketing *T*-2.
Now, two - for - one deals on pizza are common; so are *?* 99 - cent specials on sandwiches normally priced * *PRO* twice as high.
The discounting, say 0 *?* fast - food operators, occurs on a scale *RNR*-3 and with a frequency *RNR*-3 0 they haven't seen *T*-1 before.
The result is that some franchisees are running hard *PRO*-1 just to stay even, *PRO*-1 laying off middle managers and working harder *PRO*-2 to make less.
Joe Mack, a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc., a Burger King operator in Omaha, Neb., says 0 discounting is so prevalent that "we have *-1 to serve 15% to 20% *U* more customers" *PRO* to keep sales *PRO*-2 level.
"It's almost as if you're doing extra work *PRO*-1 to give away the food," he says *T*-2.
Alan D'Agosto, president of Panda's Inc., an operator of Arby's restaurants in Omaha, says: "All 0 we're doing *T*-1 is *PRO* keeping the customers *PRO*-2 coming, but we aren't increasing sales."
With fast - food outlets on every corner, he, like many, doesn't think 0 he has a choice in the price war: "Our customers say that they won't go into a fast - food store unless they get a coupon."
If the battle continues much longer, many fast - food businesses will close or merge, predicts 0 *T*-2 Vincent Morrissey, who *T*-1 owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest.
"The industry is overbuilt," he says *T*-1.
"Fast - food franchisers have managed *PRO*-1 to squeeze in stores into every corner available."
The National Restaurant Association says 0 quick - service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14% to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987, the last year for which figures are available *T*-1.
With the market so crowded, says 0 *?* a spokesman for Wendy's in Columbus, Ohio, "If you're doing well, you're doing well at someone else's expense."
*PRO* Simply put *-1, there isn't enough business for every store to grow.
According to Mr. Rohs, inflation - adjusted, same - store sales at company - owned Wendy's units in the U.S. have trailed year - earlier levels throughout 1989, except for August.
"McDonald's has also been running *PRO*-2 negative all year," the analyst says *T*-1.
Spokesmen for Wendy's and McDonald's criticized Mr. Rohs's calculations.
Jack Greenberg, executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald's, says 0 the company doesn't compute, much less disclose, inflation - adjusted, same - store sales.
He adds that short - term comparisons "can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year."
Profit margins at company - owned McDonald's outlets in the U.S. "are holding up quite nicely," says *T*-1 Mr. Greenberg.
Profits of franchisees haven't been higher since the mid-1970s, he adds 0 *T*-1.
But Mr. Greenberg's sanguine outlook isn't matched *-1 by many fast - food industry observers.
Smaller chains and single - store operators will be the first 0 *T*-2 to fail, many in the industry predict 0 *T*-1.
Big franchise groups "can ride out the storm a lot longer," says *T*-1 Mr. Harty, the Burger King operator in New York.
The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees.
Mr. Morrissey, the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee, notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties, or portion of sales, that they must pay franchisers *T*-1.
Franchisees can't be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to go along with a franchiser's discounting.
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program, the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end, says 0 *T*-1 Lew Rudnick, a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe, a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients.
He says 0 courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed *-1 in such cases by the need *PRO* to protect consumers from deceptive marketing.
In any case, many franchisees, in order *PRO*-1 to stay on good terms with franchisers, routinely go along with promotions.
Says *T*-1 Mr. Riese of National Restaurants: "If you resisted on prices, maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise.
WHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad *T*-1 his father gave him a piece of career advice.
"He told me *PRO*-2 to choose an area where just by *PRO*-3 being mediocre I could be great *T*-4," recalls *T*-1 Mr. Schwartz, now 40.
He tried management consulting, traded in turquoise for a while, and even managed professional wrestlers.
Now he has settled into a career that *T*-1 fits the bill--financial planning.
It *EXP*-4 should be noted *-1 that Mr. Schwartz, who *T*-2 operates out of Englewood, Colo., is a puckish sort who *T*-3 likes *PRO*-5 to give his colleagues the needle.
But in this case the needle has a very sharp point.
Though it *ICH*-2's probably safe *PRO* to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent, the fact remains that, as one wag puts it, "anybody who *T*-1 can fog a mirror" can call himself *PRO*-3 a financial planner.
Planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars, but in effect they operate in the dark.
There is no effective regulation of planners, no accepted standard for admission into their ranks--a dog got into one trade group--no way 0 *PRO* to assess their performance *T*-1, no way 0 even to know how many of them there are *T*-2 (estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000) *T*-3.
All 0 anyone need do *T*-1 is *PRO* hang up a shingle and start *-2 planning.
So it *EXP*-2 should come as no shock that the profession, if that's what it is *T*-3, has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents *T*-1 seem *-4 to be *PRO* frittering away *RNR*-5 or flat - out stealing *RNR*-5 their clients' money.
*PRO*-1 Alarmed, state and federal authorities are trying *PRO*-1 to devise ways 0 *PRO* to certify and regulate planners *T*-2.
Industry groups and reputable planners who *T*-1 are members of them want comprehensive standards, too; they're tired of *PRO*-2 seeing practitioners depicted *-3 collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine.
But reform hasn't taken hold yet.
"The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days," says *T*-1 Scott Stapf, director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association.
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA, whose members *T*-1 are state securities - law regulators, found that between 1986 and 1988 "fraud and abuse" by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $400 million *U*.
The rogues' gallery of planners involved * includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who *T*-1 had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who *T*-2 scammed his wife's grandmother.
What *T*-1's more, the losses 0 they and the others caused *T*-3 "are just what we are stumbling over *T*-2," says 0 *T*-5 Mr. Stapf, *PRO*-4 adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go *PRO*-6 undetected.
So do *?* just about all the losses that *T*-2 could be attributed *-1 to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners.
Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks 0 the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery.
His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied *-2 to all who *T*-1 call themselves *PRO*-3 financial planners.
*PRO*-1 Surveying all this, some people now think 0 the best planner might be no planner at all.
For most investors "the benefits just aren't worth the risks," says 0 *T*-2 Barbara Roper, who *T*-1 follows financial - planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer - advocacy organization based * in Washington.
She concedes that such a position is "unfair" to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade, but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled *-1 *PRO*-2 to take it.
She says 0 her group used *-2 to give tips on *PRO* selecting planners--*PRO* check educational and experience credentials, consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus--but found that even some people who *T*-1 took these steps "were still getting ripped *-3 off."
The bad news, however, hasn't been bad enough *PRO* to kill the growing demand for financial planning.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which *T*-1 eliminated many tax shelters peddled * by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had *-2 to make an unplanned exit from the business.
But membership in the International Association of Financial Planners (IAFP), the industry's biggest trade group, is still nearly triple what it was *T*-2 in 1980, and it *EXP*-3's believed that the ranks of planners who *T*-1 don't belong to any group have soared as well.
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners, and the pool of capital 0 they influence *T*-1 is enormous.
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted * by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $154 billion *U* of their clients' money in the previous 12 months.
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult *RNR*-2, if not impossible *RNR*-2, 0 *PRO* to regulate *T*-1.
Even the minority of them who *T*-1 must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "investment advisers"--people who *T*-2 are in the business of *PRO* counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically--have been enough *PRO* to swamp the agency's capacity.
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned *PRO* to keep tabs on investment advisers--about the same as in 1980--even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade.
Currently, a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years.
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist *PRO*-2 to figure out our problem," says *T*-1 Kathryn McGrath, director of the SEC's division of investment management.
So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned *-2 over to an industry - funded, self - regulatory organization patterned * on the National Association of Securities Dealers, which *T*-1 operates in the brokerage business.
Such an organization could, among other things, set minimum standards for competence, ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who *T*-1 broke the rules.
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that *T*-1 was far from united to begin with.
Mr. Schwartz, the puckish planner from Englewood, Colo., says that *PRO* allowing the business to police itself would be "like *PRO* putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank."
Mr. Gargan, the Tampa planner who *T*-1 heads one trade group, favors *PRO* simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC *PRO*-2 to hire more staff.
(Mr. Gargan's views are not greeted *-1 with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP, the major industry organization.
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups *PRO* to discuss common standards that *T*-3 might be applied *-1 to planners *T*-4, Mr. Gargan's group was excluded *-2.
That may be because Mr. Gargan, *PRO*-1 smarting at what he considered *T*-2 slurs on his membership standards made * by the rival group, enrolled his dog, Beauregard, as a member of the IAFP.
Then he sent the pooch's picture with the certificate of membership--it was made *-1 out to "Boris ` Bo' Regaard"--to every newspaper 0 he could think of *T*-2.)
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification.
NASAA, the organization of state securities regulators, is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted * in eight states.
It requires financial planners *PRO*-1 to register with states, pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest.
The most common conflict involves compensation.
NASAA estimates that nearly 90% of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities, insurance and other financial products 0 they recommend *T*-1.
The issue: Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments, or the ones that *T*-1 garner the biggest commissions?
In 1986 the New York attorney general's office got an order *ICH*-1 from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp., an Albany financial - planning firm that *T*-4 had invested $55 million *U* on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors.
In its notice of action, the attorney general said 0 the company had promised *PRO*-1 to put clients into "balanced" investment portfolios; instead, the attorney general alleged 0 *?*, the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high - risk investments in paintings, coins and Florida condos.
Those investments paid big commissions *ICH*-3 to First Meridian, payments 0 investors were never told *-2 about *T*-1, the attorney general alleged 0 *T*-4.
Investors were further assured *-1 that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted *-2.
In practice, the attorney general alleged 0 *?* in an affidavit, if an investor had access to cash "the chances of *PRO* being turned *-2 down by First Meridian were about as probable as *PRO* being rejected *-3 by the Book - of - the - Month Club."
And, the attorney general added 0 *?*, First Meridian's president, Roger V. Sala, portrayed himself as a "financial expert" when his qualifications largely consisted of a high - school diploma, work as a real - estate and insurance salesman, and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth *T*-2.
First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing, according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general.
Harry Manion, Mr. Sala's attorney, says 0 his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general's contentions about First Meridian's business practices are incorrect.
As for Mr. Sala's qualifications, "the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided 0 Mr. Sala wasn't qualified because he didn't have a Harvard degree," says *T*-1 Mr. Manion.
Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common.
Two such actions, both filed * earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta, could be particularly embarrassing to the industry: both name J. Chandler Peterson, an Atlanta financial planner who *T*-1 is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP, as defendant.
One suit, filed * by more than three dozen investors, charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $9.7 million *U* put * into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted *T*-1, *PRO*-2 spending some of it *PRO*-3 to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest *T*-4.
Those companies, in turn, paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees, the suit alleges 0 *T*-1.
The other suit was filed *-3 by two men in a dispute over $100,000 *U* investments 0 each says 0 he made *T*-1 with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort *PRO* to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale, Ariz.
One plaintiff, a doctor, testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $50,000 *U* 0 *PRO* to join a sort of investment club which *T*-1 essentially gave the physician "the privilege of *PRO*-3 making additional investments" with Mr. Peterson *T*-2.
In affidavits, each plaintiff claims 0 Mr. Peterson promised 0 the bank purchase would be completed *-1 by the end of 1988 or the money returned.
Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs' and other investors' money to a meeting of the bank's directors.
*T*-1 Wearing a business suit and western - style hat and boots, he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million *U* in cash on a table in front of the directors, says 0 *T*-2 Myron Diebel, the bank's president.
"He said 0 he wanted *PRO*-2 to show the color of his money," recalls *T*-1 Mr. Diebel.
Bank officials, however, showed him the door, and the sale never came off.
According to the suit, Mr. Peterson has yet *-1 to return the plaintiffs' investment.
They want it back.
Mr. Peterson declines *PRO*-1 to comment on specific allegations in the two suits, *PRO*-1 saying 0 he prefers *PRO*-2 to save such responses for court.
But he does say that all of his activities have been "entirely proper."
On the suit by the limited partners, he says 0 he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs.
The suit, he adds 0 *?*, "is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people."
Rearding the suit over the bank bid, Mr. Peterson says 0 it is filled *-1 with "inflammatory language and half truths."
He declines *PRO*-1 to go into specifics.
Mr. Peterson says 0 the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a "sign of the times" in which people generally are more prone *PRO* to sue *T*-1.
"I don't know anybody in the industry who *T*-1 hasn't experienced litigation," he says *T*-2.
Mr. Peterson also says 0 he doesn't consider himself a financial planner anymore.
He now calls himself *PRO*-1 an "investment banker."
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners, it *EXP*-1's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way.
*PRO*-1 Using it, wouldn't a proessional hesitate *PRO*-1 to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance *PRO* to invest witha planner?
Other cases go *PRO*-1 to show that an old saw still applies: If it sounds too good 0 *T*-2 to be true, it probably is *?*.
Certificates of deposit don't pay 23% a year, for example, but that didn't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner.
Now they're losers and he's in jail in Mobile County.
CDs yielding 40% are even more implausible--especially when the issuing "bank" in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over * by a local gas - station operator *T*-1--but investors fell for that one too.
And the Colorado planner who *T*-1 promised *PRO*-2 to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $100 *U*?
*PRO* Never mind.
You already know the answer.

The Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to protect the U.S. flag from desecration.
The 51 - 48 roll call fell *PRO*-1 well short of the two - thirds majority needed * *PRO* to approve changes to the Constitution.
The vote, in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush's position *T*-2, was a victory for Democratic leaders, who *T*-1 opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights.
"We can support the American flag without *PRO*-2 changing the American Constitution," said *T*-1 Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
In order *PRO*-1 to defuse pressure for an amendment, Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash .) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before *PRO*-2 voting on the constitutional change.
Mr. Bush said 0 he would allow the bill to become law without his signature, because he said 0 only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately.
In June, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who *T*-2 set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration, *PRO*-4 saying 0 he was "engaging in political expression" that *T*-3 is protected *-1 by the First Amendment.

PAPERS:
Management and unions representing 2,400 employees at Torstar Corp.'s Toronto Star reached a tentative contract agreement Friday, *PRO*-1 averting a strike by most employees of Canada's largest daily newspaper.
Members of the largest union, representing 1,700 workers, voted in favor of the pact yesterday.
Four other unions have yet *-1 to vote, but their leadership also recommended approval.
The pact proposes a 2 1/2 - year contract with a raise of 8% in the first year, 7% in the second and 4% for the final six months.
The list of laboratories claiming *PRO* to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from "cold fusion" experiments is slowly growing.
But the experiments continue *-2 to be plagued *-1 by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms.
New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable *PRO*-1 to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions, *PRO* leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment *PRO*-2 to support University of Utah chemists' claim of *PRO* achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures.
The latest developments in cold fusion research were presented *-1 in 24 reports delivered * at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society, the first scientific meeting in five months 0 *T*-2 to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments.
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research.
Of the 1,300 chemists registered * for the society's weeklong meeting, fewer than 200 *T*-1 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end.
This was in contrast with the society's meeting last May, at the height of the controversy, when more than 1,500 scientists, along with scores of reporters and TV crews, crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject *T*-1.
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments *T*-1 triggered the cold fusion uproar, Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons, were at the meeting.
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set * up by the Department of Energy *PRO*-1 to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience.
The committee is *-1 to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research.
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new, more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis - of - water experiments described * last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons.
The experiments involve *PRO* encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into "heavy" water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known * as deuterium *T*-1.
When an electric current is applied *-1 to the palladium and platinum electrodes *T*-2, the heavy water did begin *-3 to break up, or dissociate.
Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy.
But Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said 0 their experiments also produced large amounts of heat.
The heat energy plus the energy consumed * by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy *ICH*-1 coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in, they reported 0 *T*-2.
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation, they asserted that the "excess" heat energy must be coming from energy released * by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod.
As of last weekend, a dozen labs also have reported *PRO*-1 measuring "excess" heat from similar electrolytic experiments, although amounts of such heat vary widely.
One of the seven reports *ICH*-2 presented * here of excess heat production was given *-1 by Richard A. Oriani, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota.
Mr. Oriani said 0 his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed *-2 to produce results *T*-1.
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who *T*-1 said 0 they were getting excess heat.
"The results were fascinating," he said *T*-1.
On the fourth "run" with the borrowed rod, the experiment began *-1 producing excess heat.
The experiment was stopped *-1 briefly *PRO* to change an instrument.
When it was restarted *-1 *T*-2, heat output "really took off" and produced excess heat for several hours before *PRO*-3 dying down, he said 0 *T*-4.
*PRO* Typical of other experiments, Mr. Oriani said 0 his experiment was "very erratic."
It would go along *PRO*-2 doing nothing but *PRO*-3 dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times, it would begin *-1 producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before *PRO* quieting down.
The excess heat was 15% to 20% more than the energy involved * in the electrolysis of water.
Mr. Oriani said 0 the heat bursts were too large and too long 0 *PRO*-3 to be explained *-1 by the sudden release of energy that *T*-2 might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times, as some scientists have suggested.
"There is a reality to the excess energy," he said *T*-1.
Other scientists said 0 they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time.
The bursts often occur, they said 0 *?*, after they "perturbed" the experiments by *PRO*-2 raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied *, or switching the current off and on.
One chemist privately suggested 0 this hinted that some "anomalous" chemical reactions might be producing the heat.
One reason 0 questions surround the heat experiments *T*-1 is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements.
Typically, the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured *-1 in tenths of a watt.
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put *-1 into the electrolytic cells *T*-2.
A cell filled * with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled * with ordinary water next to it, reported 0 *T*-1 Turgut M. Gur, an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins, head of the Stanford experimental team.
One of the few hints 0 the excess heat might be produced *-1 by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University.
Mr. Bockris previously reported *PRO*-1 getting bursts of excess heat and of *PRO*-1 detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water.
He said that within the past few days, he's gotten evidence that there is a "weak correlation" between the time 0 the heat bursts occur *T*-1 and the production of tritium.
There isn't any way 0 *PRO* to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water *T*-2, so it *EXP*-3's been difficult *PRO* to tell whether the tritium formation is related *-1 to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon.
Increasingly careful attempts *PRO* to measure neutrons, which *T*-1 would be strong evidence of fusion reactions, continue *-2 to be negative.
Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced * in their experiment but later conceded 0 the measurements were questionable.
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reported 0 they went so far as *PRO*-1 to take a "cold fusion" experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite *PRO*-2 to shield the detectors from cosmic rays.
A number of times they detected neutrons in one, sometimes two, of the three detectors, but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors--and they think 0 that was a spurious event.
Shimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said 0 researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided *PRO*-1 not to announce it until they could confirm it.
In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded *-1 in both detectors at the same time.
They concluded 0 the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment.
At the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, new experiments indicated that the lithium added * to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod--which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted *T*-1, reported 0 *T*-2 Philip Ross from the California laboratory.

USX Corp. and its Japanese partner, Kobe Steel Ltd., agreed *PRO*-1 to form a joint venture *PRO*-2 to build a new plant 0 *T*-3 to produce hot - dipped galvanized sheet products, mainly for the automotive market.
Terms *ICH*-3 weren't disclosed *-2 for the plant, which *T*-1 will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons.
The move by the nation's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies.
Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans *PRO* to build additional lines for such coated corrosion - resistant steel.
The surge in production, analysts say 0 *?*, raises questions about capacity outpacing demand.
They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992, when the current import trade restraint program ends *T*-2, which *T*-1 could result in more imports.
"There's too much capacity," contended *T*-1 Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
"I don't think 0 there's anyone not building one."
He does add, however, that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S. - made steel in their autos, instead of *PRO*-1 relying heavily on imported steel.
That trend could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet.
The hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market, *PRO*-1 coveted * by all major integrated steelmakers wanting *PRO* to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills--those spun * off to employees.
Indeed, USX said 0 it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992, compared with 10.2 million tons shipped * in 1988.
For the first eight months of 1989, analysts say 0 shipments of hot - dipped galvanized steel increased about 8% from a year earlier, while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4%.
USX and Kobe Steel hope *PRO*-1 to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50 - 50 partnership by the end of the year, with construction tentatively slated * for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992.
USX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot - dipped galvanized steel, but this marks the first so - called greenfield plant for such production.
Moreover, it will boost by 50% USX's current hot - dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons.
The company said 0 it doesn't expect the new line's capacity to adversely affect the company's existing hot - dipped galvanizing lines.
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so - called electrogalvanized steel, which *T*-1 is another way 0 *PRO* to make coated corrosion - resistant steel *T*-2.
One of the advantages of the hot - dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered *-1 with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly.
*PRO* READY *PRO*-1 TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio?
First, a pop quiz.
When you think of the words "risk" and "investment *T*-3," what *T*-1's the specific peril that *T*-2 comes to mind?
Pencils down.
If you're like most people, you said 0 it's a holding that *T*-2 goes completely sour--maybe a bond that *T*-3 defaults or a stock whose value *T*-1 disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding.
"People tend *-1 to see risk primarily on that one dimension," says Timothy Kochis, national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte, Haskins & Sells.
But therein lies *T*-1 another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of *PRO* shaping your portfolio *PRO*-2 to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind - sided *-2 by others.
This is clearly not good news to all you people who *T*-1 sleep like babies every night, *PRO*-2 lulled *-3 by visions of your money sitting *PRO*-4 risk - free in six - month CDs.
Risk wears many disguises, and investments that *T*-1 are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other, less obvious kinds.
U.S. Treasury bonds, for example, are supersafe when it comes to *PRO* returning money at maturity *T*-1.
But their value as investments can be decimated *-1 by inflation, which *T*-2 erodes the purchasing power of bonds' fixed - dollar interest payments.
Risk is also a function of time.
When financial professionals measure risk mathematically *T*-1, they usually focus on the volatility of short - term returns.
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills, for example, because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider.
That is usually measured *-1 by the standard deviation, or divergence, of annual results from the average return over time.
But investors who *T*-2 are preoccupied *-1 with short - term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk--*PRO* not generating enough money *PRO* to meet long - term financial and life - style goals.
For instance, some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash; last Friday's debacle only reinforced those feelings.
But the stock market, despite some stomach - churning declines, has far outperformed other securities over extended periods.
By *PRO*-1 retreating to the apparent security of, say, money - market funds, investors may not be earning enough investment return *PRO* to pay for a comfortable retirement.
"That's the biggest risk of all--the risk of *PRO* not meeting your objectives," says *T*-1 Steven B. Enright, a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services.
As a result, financial advisers say 0 they take several steps when *PRO* evaluating the riskiness of clients' portfolios *T*-1.
They estimate the return 0 a person's current portfolio is likely *-3 to generate *T*-2 over time, along with a standard deviation that *T*-1 suggests how much the return will vary *T*-4 year by year.
They try *PRO*-2 to figure out the long - term results 0 the person needs *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to meet major goals.
And they eyeball types of risk that *T*-1 are not easily quantified *-2.
The portfolios of two hypothetical families, one a couple at retirement age and another a two - income couple at age 45, illustrate several types of risk that investors need *-1 to consider *T*-2.
For instance, the insured municipal bonds that *T*-1 dominate the older couple's portfolio were probably selected *-2 in large part for their low repayment risk.
But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest - rate risk.
The younger couple's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue.
*PRO* Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as *PRO* calculated *-2 by Seidman Financial Services, which *T*-1 is the financial - planning affiliate of BDO Seidman.
That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings.
But one price paid * for the higher expected return is greater short - term volatility, as *PRO* reflected *-2 in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates *T*-1 for the younger couple's portfolio.
(Here's *T*-1 how *PRO* to interpret a standard deviation figure *T*-2: *PRO* Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it.
Then *PRO* take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation.
In two of three years, the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate.
Then *PRO* add and subtract two standard deviations *PRO*-1 to get a wider range.
There's a 95% probability 0 any year's result will fall in the range.)
Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean 0 those investments are riskier in terms of *PRO* meeting the holders' long - term goals.
Indeed, the older couple's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return won't generate enough dollars *PRO* to meet their spending plans.
"They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market," says *T*-1 John H. Cammack, a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington.
"But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future."
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.
When it comes to investing *T*-3, *PRO* trying *PRO*-4 to weigh risk and reward can seem like *PRO* throwing darts blindfolded: Investors don't know the actual returns that securities will deliver *T*-2, or the ups and downs that *T*-1 will occur along the way.
*PRO* Looking to the past can provide some clues.
Over several decades, for instance, investors who *T*-1 put up with the stock market's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and "cash" investments like Treasury bills.
But while history can suggest what *T*-1 is reasonable 0 *PRO* to expect *T*-2 there's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself.
For instance, some analysts believe 0 bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market.
And returns on cash investments may continue *-1 to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did *?* over the long - term past.

P&G, Cincinnati, agreed *PRO*-2 to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock *ICH*-1 for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock, a total of about 11 million P&G shares.
The transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics.
The company already markets a wide range of detergents, food, household and health - care products.
USACafes Limited Partnership said 0 it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $71 million *U* in cash.
USACafes, which *T*-1 is nearly half - owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas, said 0 it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible.
The Bonanza franchise system, which *T*-1 generates about $600 million *U* in sales annually, represented substantially all of the partnership's assets.
The sale of the system has been challenged *-1 in a class - action suit on behalf of unit holders filed * last week in a Delaware court, USACafes said 0 *T*-2.
The company said 0 it believes 0 the suit is without merit.
U.S. official reserve assets rose $6.05 billion *U* in September, to $68.42 billion *U*, the Treasury Department said 0 *T*-1.
The gain compared with a $1.10 billion *U* decline in reserve assets in August to $62.36 billion *U*, the department said 0 *T*-1.
U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold, special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position--its ability *PRO* to draw foreign currencies--at the IMF.
The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $5.67 billion *U* in September to $39.08 billion *U*, while its gold reserves were virtually unchanged at $11.07 billion *U*.
U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $247 million *U*, to $9.49 billion *U*, and its reserve position at the IMF increased $142 million *U*, to $8.79 billion *U*.
For Cheap Air Fares, *PRO* Spend Christmas Aloft
IT *ICH*-1 ISN'T TRUE that a 90 - year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly *PRO* free.
But his circumstances are among the few that *T*-1 can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America.
In recent years, carriers have become much more picky about who *T*-1 can fly on the cheap.
But there still are a few ways 0 today's traveler can qualify under the airline's many restrictions *T*-1.
One of the best deals, though, may mean *PRO* skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives.
This week, many carriers are announcing cut - rate fares designed * *PRO* to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed--and slowest--days of the year, including Christmas.
In recent years, the airlines had waited until the last moment *PRO*-1 to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares.
That approach flopped: Last Christmas Day, a USAir Group Inc. DC - 9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh.
So this year, the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts.
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70% from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24, 25, 29, 30 and 31, and Jan. 4, 5 and 6.
The promotions--dubbed * *PRO*-2 everything from 'T- is the Season 0 *PRO* to be Jolly *T*-1 to Kringle fares--put round - trip fares at $98 *U*, $148 *U* and $198 *U*.
"They're trying *PRO*-1 to keep planes *PRO*-3 flying on days 0 they'd normally park them *T*-2," says Roger Bard, president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville, N.C.
*PRO* Expect, of course, sky - high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know 0 vacationers are eager *PRO*-1 to travel *T*-2.
*PRO* Consider *PRO*-1 Adopting Your Spouse's Name
IF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way, couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it *EXP*-1 a hassle *PRO* to qualify for some new discounts.
Continental, a Texas Air Corp. unit, recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business - class and first - class passengers on international flights.
The Continental catch: Only immediate family members are allowed *-1, and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof 0 they're related.
That irritates many women who *T*-1 haven't taken their husbands' last name.
"What a bunch of nonsense," says *T*-1 Jessica Crosby, president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners.
"This sets things way back."
Continental's logic: It doesn't want business companions abusing the promotion by *PRO*-2 falsely claiming *PRO*-3 to be related.
"We accommodate their choice of names by *PRO*-1 allowing them to demonstrate" family affiliation with legal documents, says 0 *T*-2 Jim O'Donnell, a senior vice president.
But gay rights advocates are angry, too.
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline doesn't recognize *T*-1 as family.
"It's certainly discrimination," says attorney Evan Wolfson, whose group *T*-1 forced Trans World Airlines this year *PRO*-3 to change a rule that *T*-2 allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members.
*PRO* Take Your Vacation In a Hurricane Area
WHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states *T*-1, it downed electric and telephone lines, shot coconuts through cottage rooftops, shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives.
It also lowered some air fares.
Since the hurricane, Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., trimmed their one - way fares to the Virgin Islands to $109 *U* from prices that *T*-1 were at times double that before the storm.
The fares are code - named *-1 *PRO*-2 Hugo, Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid.
(Airlines aren't lowering fares to Northern California following this week's earthquake, but reservation agents can waive advance - purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips.)
Some hotels in the hurricane - stricken Caribbean promise money - back guarantees.
In Myrtle Beach, S.C., the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $35 *U*, or as much as 22% below regular prices.
Says *ICH*-1 Michele Hoffman, a clerk in the resort's front office: "We don't have the outdoor pool, the pool table, ping pong table, snack bar or VCR, but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi."
*PRO* Just Wait Until You're a Bit Older
SENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares.
This year, the older someone is *?* the bigger the discount.
A senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70% off regular coach fare.
Travelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age.
And centenarians fly free in first class.
Next month, Northwest Airlines says 0 *?*, a 108 - year - old Lansing, Mich., woman is taking it up on the offer *PRO*-1 to fly with her 72 - year - old son to Tampa, Fla.
Last year when Northwest first offered the promotion *T*-1, only six centenarians flew free.
If All Else Fails....
THE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers, retired military personnel and medical students.
There's even a special fare for clergy that *T*-1 doesn't require the usual stay over Saturday night.
That way, they can be home in time for work Sunday.
The government issues its first reading on third - quarter real gross national product this week in a report that *T*-1 is expected *-2 to disclose much tamer inflation.
The consensus view on real GNP, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services adjusted * for inflation, calls for a 2.3% gain, down from the second quarter's 2.5%, according to MMS International, a unit of McGraw - Hill Inc., New York.
But inflation, as *PRO*-2 measured *-1 by the GNP deflator in Thursday's report, is expected *-2 to rise only 3.5%, down from 4.6% in the second quarter.
"Inflation could be a real surprise," said *T*-1 Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., in Chicago.
"If that gets people excited, it could serve as an impetus *ICH*-2 to the fixed - income markets *PRO* to lower their rates," he added *T*-1.
The week's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales, September durable goods orders as well as September personal income, personal consumption and the saving rate.
Most are expected *-1 to fall below previous - month levels.
Many economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year, with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession.
In addition to softer production data, weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence, some analysts believe 0 the two recent natural disasters--Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake--will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter.
The recent one - day, 190 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems *-1 to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third - quarter profits now being reported *.
"The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling," says *T*-1 Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc., Washington.
The economy, he noted 0 *?*, moves the market, not vice versa.
On the other hand, Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake "to take a hunk out of fourth - quarter GNP."
His estimate of 3.3% for third - quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes 0 current inventories aren't as low as official figures indicate 0 *?*.
Demand, he believes 0 *?*, is being met *-1 from overhang rather than new production.
By and large, economists believe 0 the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions.
Edward J. Campbell, economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., New York, noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas.
Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet / Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., expects the deflator to rise 3.7%, well below the second quarter's 4.6%, partly because of what he believes 0 *T*-1 will be temporarily better price behavior.
He expects real GNP growth of only 2.1% for the quarter, *PRO*-1 noting a wider trade deficit, slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., Minneapolis, holds that the recent stock - market volatility "increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news" from recent trade deficit, employment and housing reports.
The consensus calls for a 0.5% increase in September personal income and a 0.3% gain in consumption.
In August, personal income rose 0.4% and personal consumption increased 0.9%.
Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., New York, said 0 Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1% to 0.2% *U* from personal - income growth, because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism.
Durable goods orders for September, due out tomorrow, are expected *-1 to show a slip of 1%, compared with August's 3.9% increase.
As usual, estimates on the fickle report are wide, *PRO*-1 running from a drop of 3.5% to a gain of 1.6%.
As the sponsor of the "Older Americans Freedom to Work Act," which *T*-1 would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged * 65 and older, I applaud your strong endorsement 0 *T*-2 to repeal this Depression - era fossil.
For every dollar earned * over $8,880 *U*, Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits; it's like a 50% marginal tax.
But the compounded effects of "seniors only" taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates.
*PRO* Imagine a widow who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-3 to maintain her standard of living at the same level 0 she had *T*-2 before she had *-4 to pay the catastrophic surtax.
Although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage, largely due to the earnings limit, she would have *-1 to earn an additional $4,930 *U* *PRO*-2 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $496 *U*.
*PRO* Eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit.
Repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose *?* in increased Social Security benefit payments.
We now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order *PRO*-1 to include earnings - limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill.
Since all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill, it is the Democrats who *T*-2 will be held *-1 fully accountable if an earnings test amendment *ICH*-4 is not allowed *-3 from the floor.
The time *ICH*-2 is now 0 *PRO* to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation's seniors *T*-1.
Rep. J. Dennis Hastert (R., Ill.)
Gary J. Schantz, 44 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief operating officer.
Polymerix makes lumber - like materials that it describes *T*-1 as "plastic wood."
The operating chief's post is new.
Martin Schrager, 51, who *T*-2 had been president, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 vice chairman.
He remains chief executive officer.
Mr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp.
Separately, the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski, a consultant.
The company also said 0 it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $750,000 *U*.
The British Petroleum Co. PLC said 0 its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea.
In an official release, BP said 0 initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day, and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached *-2 in 1990.
In East Germany, where humor has long been the only way 0 *PRO* to express political criticism *T*-1 *T*-2, they're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz.
Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him.
"You have *-2 to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes," says *T*-3 an East German mother of two who *T*-1 loves swapping political barbs with her friends.
"With Krenz, we just don't know what *PRO* to expect *T*-1."
Mr. Krenz doesn't seem *-2 to be the knee - jerk hardliner 0 many initially thought 0 he was *T*-3 when the 52 - year - old Politburo member was selected last week *-1 *PRO*-5 to succeed Erich Honecker *T*-4.
But he doesn't appear *-1 to be ready *PRO*-2 to make broad changes either.
According to East Germany's ADN news agency, Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged 0 East Germany could learn from Moscow's glasnost policies.
Already last week, Mr. Krenz started *-1 overhauling East Germany's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media.
On Thursday, a day after he took office, East German television broke into regular programming *PRO*-1 to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions 0 for a panel of officials to answer *T*-3 *T*-2.
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet - style glasnost.
"It was quite a shock," says *T*-1 a 43 - year - old East German shopkeeper.
"For the first time in my life, I wasn't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television."
Other changes, including *PRO* easing restrictions on travel for East Germans, are expected *-1.
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans, who *T*-1 have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks *PRO*-2 to demand democratic changes, depends largely on whether they feel 0 they can trust Mr. Krenz.
And that's a problem.
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified *-1 with his mentor, Mr. Honecker, but also blamed *-1 for *PRO*-2 ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for *PRO*-2 praising China for *PRO*-3 sending tanks against student demonstrators.
"I hope 0 he grows with the job," says *T*-1 Rainer Eppelmann, a Protestant pastor in East Berlin.
"The most important thing is that he have a chance."
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated *-1 to East Germany's conservative vein of communism, there is much about his style that *T*-2 sets him apart from his party comrades.
Unlike Mr. Honecker, who *T*-1 tended *-2 to lecture people about socialist values, Mr. Krenz enjoys *PRO*-3 asking questions.
Indeed, one of his first actions as leader was *PRO* to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers--a la Gorbachev.
He was later shown *-1 on television, *PRO*-1 fielding questions.
At one point, he asked a worker whether he thought 0 East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies.
The worker's tart reply: "It's more than just travel.
People have a sense 0 the government is ignoring the real problems in our society."
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies.
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring.
Rather than *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to "lecture us," says 0 *?* one congressional aide who *T*-1 attended the two - hour meeting, Mr. Krenz "wanted *PRO*-4 to listen."
Rep. Ronnie Flippo (D., Ala.), one of the members of the delegation, says 0 he was particularly impressed *-1 by Mr. Krenz's ready admission that East Germany needed *-2 to change.
"He's a very tough man, but one who *T*-1's also open to arguments," adds *T*-2 an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
But there's another side to Mr. Krenz.
*PRO*-3 Born *-2 in a Baltic town in an area which *T*-1 is now part of Poland, he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus.
He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron, Mr. Honecker, and emerged as the heir apparent.
Barbara Donovan, an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich, says 0 Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image, but she doubts 0 he's a true reformer.
Even if he is *?*, she adds 0 *?*, he appears *-2 to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
Against this background, the new East German leader must move quickly *PRO*-1 to shore up his government's standing.
The sudden growth of the opposition movement, together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary, has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers' uprising in 1953.
"He doesn't have any honeymoon period," says *T*-1 a Western diplomat based * in East Berlin.
"But if he's sharp and quick, he has a chance."
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him.
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations.
And his relative youth could help him *PRO*-1 project a more vibrant image, contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out - of - touch old man.
For average East Germans, Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle.
"Either he wasn't being real in the past, or he isn't being real right now," says a 30 - year - old East German doctor.
"Either way, I have a problem with how quickly he's changed *T*-1."
The doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning.
The walls of the church are covered *-1 with leaflets, news clippings, and handwritten notes associated * with the country's political opposition.
"I have *-1 to come here *PRO*-3 to read the walls," says *?* the doctor, "because it's information 0 I still can't get *T*-2 through the newspapers."
Meanwhile, East Germany's growing openness may even allow the state - controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor.
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin's main wallpaper factory and the need *PRO* to boost production.
East Germans remember a comment *ICH*-2 a few years ago by Kurt Hager, the government's top ideologist, that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper, there's no reason 0 *PRO* to change your own *T*-1.
His point was 0 there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet - style changes.
"It *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to know whether it was intended *-3 to be funny," says *?* the East Berlin shopkeeper, "But everyone 0 I know *T*-1 laughed about it.
FOR THOSE WHO *T*-1 DELIGHT in the misfortune of others, *PRO* read on.
This is a story about suckers.
Most of us know a sucker.
Many of us are suckers.
But what we may not know *T*-2 is just what *T*-1 makes somebody a sucker.
What *T*-1 makes people blurt out their credit - card numbers to a caller 0 they've never heard of *T*-2?
Do they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to *PRO* being a grand - prize winner?
What *T*-1 makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door?
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that *T*-2 will knock your socks off, once it is built *-1?
Because in the end, these people always wind up *-1 asking themselves the same question: "How could I be so stupid *T*-2?"
There are, unfortunately, plenty of answers to that question--and scam artists know all of them.
"These people are very skilled at *PRO* finding out what *T*-1 makes a person tick," says *T*-2 Kent Neal, chief of the economic - crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney's Office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a major haven for boiler rooms.
"Once they size them up, then they know what buttons *PRO* to push *T*-1."
John Blodgett agrees--and he ought *-1 to know.
He used *-1 to be a boiler - room salesman, *PRO*-2 peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins.
"There's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities 0 you pitch *T*-1 different ways," he says *T*-2.
The most obvious pitch, of course, is the lure of big returns.
"We're all a little greedy.
Everyone is vulnerable," says *T*-1 Charles Harper, associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami.
"These guys prey on human frailties."
While the promises of big profits ought *-2 to set off warning bells, they often don't *?*, in part because *PRO* get - rich - quick tales have become embedded *-1 in American folklore.
"The overnight success story is part of our culture, and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people," says *T*-1 Michael Cunningham, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville.
"Other people are making it overnight, and the rest who *T*-1 toil daily don't want *PRO*-2 to miss that opportunity when it seems *-3 to come along *T*-4."
Adds *ICH*-4 Spencer Barasch, branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth, Texas: "Why do people play the lottery when the odds *ICH*-3 are great against them *T*-2 *T*-1?
People are shooting for a dream."
Clearly, though, scam artists have *-1 to be a bit more subtle than *PRO*-1 simply promising millions; the psychology of suckers isn't simply the psychology of the greedy.
There's also, for instance, the need *PRO* to be part of the in - crowd.
So one popular ploy is *PRO* to make a prospective investor feel like an insider, joining an exclusive group that *T*-1 is about *-2 to make a killing.
Between 1978 and 1987, for instance, SH Oil in Winter Haven, Fla., sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents, while *PRO*-1 turning away numerous other eager investors.
The owner of the company, Stephen Smith, who *T*-1 has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges, confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said 0 the location of his wells was confidential, according to a civil suit filed * in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller's office.
Neither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed, the suit alleged 0 *T*-1.
Such schemes, says 0 *?* Tony Adamski, chief of the financial - crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, D.C., appeal to investors' "desire *PRO* to believe 0 this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given * this opportunity."
At times, salesmen may embellish the inside information with "the notion that this is some slightly shady, slightly illegal investment 0 the person is being included *-1 in *T*-3," says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Cunningham.
In *PRO* appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts, the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment *PRO*-4 secret--*PRO*-2 insulating himself from *PRO*-3 being discovered *-1 and keeping his victim from *PRO* consulting with others.
It also adds to the mystery of the venture.
Mr. Blodgett, the boiler - room veteran, believes that for many investors, the *PRO* get - rich - quick scams carry a longed - for element of excitement.
"Once people got into it, I was allowing them to live a dream," he says *T*-1.
He phoned them with updates on the investment, such as "funny things that *T*-1 happened at the well that week," he says 0 *T*-2.
"You gave them some excitement that they didn't have *T*-1 in their lives."
(Mr. Blodgett, who *T*-2 was convicted *-1 in Florida state court of *PRO*-3 selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use *ICH*-6 of the telephone *PRO* to defraud and deceive, is now on probation.
He says 0 he has quit the business and is back in school, *PRO*-1 majoring in psychology with aspirations *PRO* to go into industrial psychology.)
For some investors, it's the appearances that *T*-1 leave them *PRO*-2 deceived.
"The trappings of success *ICH*-1 go a long way--*PRO* wearing the right clothes, doing the right things," says *T*-2 Paul Andreassen, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard.
Conservative appearances make people think 0 it's a conservative investment.
"People honestly lose money on risky investments that they didn't realize 0 *T*-2 were a crapshoot," he says *T*-1.
Paul Wenz, a Phoenix, Ariz., attorney, says 0 a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery.
But Mr. Wenz, who *T*-1 says 0 he lost $43,000 *U* in one precious - metals deal and $39,000 *U* in another, says 0 a salesman "used a business - venture approach" with him, *PRO*-4 sending investment literature, a contract limiting the firm's liability, and an insurance policy.
When he visited the company's office *T*-1, he says 0 *?*, it had "all the trappings of legitimacy."
Still others are stung *-1 by a desire *PRO* to do both well and good, says 0 *T*-2 Douglas Watson, commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's bunko - forgery division.
Born - again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do - gooder investment pitches.
But hardly the only ones: The scams promise--among other things--*PRO*-1 to help *PRO* save the environment, feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children.
Psychologists say 0 isolated people who *T*-1 don't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud.
Scam artists seek out such people--or try *PRO*-1 to make sure that their victims isolate themselves.
For instance, salesmen may counter a man's objection that he wants *PRO*-2 to discuss an investment with his wife by *PRO*-3 asking, "Who *T*-1 wears the pants in your family?"
Or an investor who *T*-2 wants his accountant's advice may be told *-1, "You seem like a guy who *T*-3 can make up his own mind."
Often con artists will try *PRO*-1 to disarm their victims by *PRO*-2 emphasizing similarities between them.
William Lynes, a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp., says 0 he and his wife, Lily, warmed to the investment pitches of a penny - stock peddler from Stuart - James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them 0 he, too, had once worked with Lockheed.
The Lyneses, of Powder Springs, Ga., have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James, *PRO*-1 alleging fraud.
They are awaiting an arbitration proceeding.
They say 0 the broker took them out for lunch frequently.
He urged them *PRO*-2 to refer their friends, who *T*-1 also lost money.
(Donald Trinen, an attorney for the penny - brokerage firm, denies the fraud allegations and says 0 the Lyneses were fully apprised *-1 that they were pursuing a high - risk investment.)
"It *EXP*-1's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families *PRO*-3 to ingratiate themselves to their clients," says *T*-2 Terree Bowers, chief of the major - frauds section of the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.
"We've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country 0 they are calling *T*-1 *T*-2.
Anything *PRO* to make a sale."
Experts say that whatever a person's particular weak point *T*-1, timing is crucial.
People may be particularly vulnerable to flim - flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives *T*-1.
"Sometimes when people are making big changes, retiring from their jobs, moving to a new area *T*-2, they lose their bearings," says *T*-3 Maury Elvekrog, a licensed psychologist who *T*-1 is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger - Elvekrog Inc., a Birmingham, Mich., investment - counseling firm.
"They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time."
They are obviously also more susceptible when they need money *T*-1 - retirees, for instance, trying *PRO* to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how *PRO* to pay for a child's college expenses *T*-2.
"These people aren't necessarily stupid or naive.
Almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized *-1 in some way," says *T*-2 Jerald Jellison, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
Nick Cortese thinks 0 that's what *T*-1 happened to him.
Mr. Cortese, a 33 - year - old Delta Air Lines engineer, invested some $2,000 *U* in penny stocks through a broker who *T*-1 promised quick returns.
"We were saving up *PRO*-1 to buy a house, and my wife was pregnant," says *T*-2 Mr. Cortese.
"It was just before the Christmas holidays, and I figured 0 we could use some extra cash."
The investment is worth about $130 *U* today.
"Maybe it was just a vulnerable time," says *T*-1 Mr. Cortese.
"Maybe the next day or even an hour later, I wouldn't have done it."
Ms. Brannigan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Atlanta bureau.
The Food and Drug Administration said 0 American Home Products Corp. agreed *PRO*-3 to recall certain generic drugs that *T*-2 were produced *-1 by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville, N.Y.
Quantum stopped shipping the drugs last month, following a federal investigation regarding information 0 the company supplied *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to obtain three drug approvals.
The FDA requested the recall of Quantum's mioxidil tablets, chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because, it said 0 *T*-2, the size of the production runs submitted * for testing *PRO* to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented *-1 as much larger than it actually was *?*.
American Home Products, based * in New York, agreed *PRO*-1 to recall four other products, trazadone, doxepin, diazepam and lorazapam, because of concerns about data submitted * in their original approval applications before the FDA.
No safety problems with the products are known *-1, the FDA said 0 *T*-2.
An FDA spokesperson said 0 the drugs are still available under other brand names.
Last month, American Home Products said 0 it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit.
It also temporarily closed Quantum, because of the internal investigation, as well as the FDA's ongoing inquiry.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Home Products rose 75 cents to $105 *U* on Friday.
Whittle Communications Limited Partnership, Knoxville, Tenn., will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women.
"La Familia de Hoy," or "Today's Family," will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming.
The television element of "La Familia" includes a series of two - minute informational features 0 *T*-2 to air seven days a week on the Spanish - language Univision network, a unit of Univision Holdings Inc., which *T*-1 is 80%-owned by Hallmark Cards Inc.
The features will focus on "parenting, family health and nutrition, and financial management," and will carry 30 seconds of advertising.
The magazines, also ad - supported, will be distributed *-1 in more than 10,000 doctors' offices, clinics, and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities.
The board of this Ponce, Puerto Rico concern voted *PRO*-1 to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter.
The third - largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said 0 it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results *T*-1 this week.
Ponce Federal said 0 the dividend was suspended *-1 in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.
General Electric Co. said 0 it signed a contract *ICH*-3 with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $400 million *U* power plant, which *T*-2 is being built *-1 in Burrillville, R.I.
GE, along with a division of Ebasco, a subsidiary of Enserch Corp., have been building the first 250 - megawatt phase of the project, which they expect *PRO*-1 to complete *T*-2 in late 1990.
The second portion will be completed *-1 the following year.
GE's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion.
Vickers PLC, a United Kingdom defense and engineering company, said 0 an investment unit controlled * by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02% from about 14.6% Thursday and from 13.7% the previous week.
I.E.P. Securities Ltd., a unit of Mr. Brierley's Hong Kong - based Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares.
The latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made * over the past five months.
In May, Mr. Brierley's stake shrank to 8.7% after *PRO*-1 ranging between 9% and 11% for much of the previous year.
"Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment," a Vickers spokesman said *T*-1.
The spokesman refused *PRO*-1 to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform 0 *PRO* to launch a hostile bid for the company *T*-2.
Vickers makes tanks for the U.K. army, Rolls Royce cars, and has marine and medical businesses.
Four workers at GTE Corp.'s headquarters have been diagnosed *-1 as *PRO*-2 having hepatitis, and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection, company and city officials said 0 *T*-3.
The four cases were all reported *-1 to GTE's medical director and state and local health authorities.
GTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed * by GTE's private food vending contractor, ARA Services Inc., was suffering from a strain of the virus, officials said 0 *T*-1.
More than 700 people work in the GTE building.
The cafeteria remains closed.
Dr. Andrew McBride, city health director, said 0 his staff suspects 0 the hepatitis, which *T*-2 can be highly contagious, was spread *-1 by the cafeteria worker with the virus.
The exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted *T*-1 hasn't been determined *-3 but should be known *-3 by the end of the week, Dr. McBride said 0 *T*-2.
Hepatitis A, considered *PRO* the least dangerous strain of the virus, has been confirmed *-1 in at least one GTE employee, company and city officials said 0 *T*-2.
"From a public health point of view we're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life - threatening," said *T*-1 Dr. Frank Provato, GTE's medical director.
"It's a double - edged sword though, because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis."
GTE officials began *-1 posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure *ICH*-2 Wednesday morning at various places at the company, said 0 *T*-3 GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch.
The company has begun *-3 offering shots of gamma globulin, which *T*-1 will diminish the flu - like symptoms of hepatitis A, in anyone who *T*-2 has contracted the disease, Mr. Mattausch said 0 *T*-4.
"We're strongly recommending that anyone who *T*-1 has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot," Mr. Mattausch added *?*, "and that means virtually everyone who *T*-2 works here.
A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for *PRO*-1 implying that he had "flip - flopped" on Manuel Noriega.
He correctly says 0 he has been down on Noriega for some time, hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup.
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise.
It meant *PRO*-1 to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega *PRO*-2 to include other notorious Central American drug runners.
The Sandinistas of Nicaragua, for example, also are part of the Castro - Medellin cartel nexus.
In his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition, Senator Kerry makes clear 0 he has not made that intellectual leap.
We were wrong.
And you thought 0 the only reason 0 *PRO* to save your canceled checks *T*-1 was *PRO* to prepare for an IRS audit.
Reggie Jackson, the retired baseball star, has found another use for them.
Mr. Jackson, who *T*-1 won the nickname "Mr. October" for his World Series exploits, is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $500 *U* each.
Dealers say 0 the budding trade in Mr. Jackson's canceled checks is unusual.
"I don't know of any living ballplayer that *T*-1's ever done it," says *T*-2 Jack Smalling, a dealer in Ames, Iowa, and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs.
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson's checks was on sale at a baseball - card show held * in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend.
Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair *PRO*-1 to sign autographs for a fee as well.
"For someone who *T*-1 has everything else--Reggie's jersey, cap and cards--his checks might be a nice addition," says *T*-3 William Vizas, owner of Bill's Sports Collectibles in Denver, who *T*-2 examined the checks at the San Francisco card show.
For years, the canceled checks of a small number of well - known baseball players have been bought and sold *-1.
But these players were dead.
"Maybe three years ago, there were a lot of {Ty} Cobbs in the hobby, and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks," says *T*-1 Mr. Smalling.
However, the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way.
"Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them," sniffs *T*-1 Bob Machon, owner of Papa's Sports Cards in Menlo Park, Calif.
"Who *T*-1 knows how much they'll be worth *T*-2 100 years from now?"
And Mr. Smalling doesn't believe 0 they're worth all that much now.
"I don't think 0 the checks are worth $15 *U* apiece," he says *T*-1.
Why Mr. Jackson, who *T*-3 couldn't be reached *-1 for comment, has made some of his checks available for sale *T*-2 isn't clear.
He probably hasn't done it for the cash.
"I would say 0 he's definitely not in need of money," says *T*-1 Matt Merola, an agent of Mr. Jackson's based * in New York.
"He has good investments."
And Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts, too.
Or at least he should *?*.
"I assume 0 those accounts are closed," says *T*-2 Mr. Smalling, *PRO*-3 referring to the accounts of the canceled checks.
"I don't think 0 he'd want *PRO*-1 to give out his current account numbers.
In the wake of a slide in sterling, a tailspin in the stock market, and a string of problematic economic indicators, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy.
In a speech prepared * for delivery to London's financial community, Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle *PRO* to wring inflation out of the British economy, *PRO*-1 using high interest rates as "the essential instrument" 0 *PRO* to carry out the campaign *T*-2.
Two weeks after *PRO*-1 boosting base rates to 15%, he pledged that "rates will have *-2 to remain high for some time 0 *T*-3 to come."
Mr. Lawson also made it *EXP*-1 clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully.
A sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses' expectations of future inflation, he argued 0 *T*-1.
In an apparent warning to currency traders who *T*-1 have lately been selling the British currency, he stated that the exchange rates will have a "major role in the assessment of monetary conditions."
In *PRO*-1 reaffirming the current monetary policy of *PRO* using high interest rates *PRO*-2 to fight inflation and shore up the pound, Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to *PRO* managing the economy.
He said 0 he monitors the money - supply figures, but doesn't give them paramount importance, as some private and government economists have suggested 0 *?*.
Mr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of *PRO* imposing direct credit controls on Britain's financial system.
Mr. Lawson's speech, delivered * at the Lord Mayor of London's annual dinner at Mansion House, came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy.
Two weeks ago, in a campaign *PRO* to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world - wide plunge in the pound, he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15%.
Despite the increase, the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week.
It was quoted *-1 at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday.
Leading up to the speech was *T*-2 a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than *PRO* previously assumed *-1.
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000, the lowest level since 1980.
While lower joblessness is generally good news, the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy isn't slowing down as much as *PRO* hoped 0 *?*--despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months.
Meanwhile, average earnings in Britain were up 8.75% *ICH*-1 in August over the previous year.
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building - society lending to a record #10.2 billion *U* ($16.22 billion *U*) last month, a much higher level than economists had predicted *?*.
In a separate speech prepared * for delivery at the dinner, Robin Leigh - Pemberton, Bank of England governor, conceded that "demand pressures were even more buoyant than *PRO* had been appreciated *-1" when the British economy was heating up last year *T*-2.
He added that "there's no quick - fix solution" to the economic woes, and said 0 "tight monetary policy is the right approach."
*PRO*-1 Discussing the recent slide in stock prices, the central bank governor stated that "the markets now appear *-2 to have steadied" after the "nasty jolt" of the 190.58 - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago.
Although the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5 - point drop in the London Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index, Mr. Leigh - Pemberton declared "that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy."
Specifically, he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market, the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk - bond financings.
*PRO*-1 Discussing future monetary arrangements, Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government's commitment *PRO* to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, but he didn't indicate when.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300-day estimate.
Lotus Development Corp. is in talks *PRO*-1 to sell its Signal stock - quote service to Infotechnology Inc., the New York parent of Financial News Network, people familiar with the negotiations said 0 *T*-2.
They said 0 the price would be around $10 million *U*.
Signal, which *T*-2 has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable, provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that *T*-3 can be received *-1 by specially equipped personal computers.
The computers will display stock prices selected * by users.
Lotus, Cambridge, Mass., has been rumored *-1 to have the sale of the four - year - old unit under consideration for a year.
The business isn't related to Lotus's main businesses of *PRO* making computer software and publishing information on compact disks.
Initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said 0 *T*-1.
The number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000, or 2.2% of those covered * by unemployment insurance, from 2,205,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2% *T*-1.
Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier.
These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.
A Labor Department spokesman said 0 the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states, particularly North Carolina and South Carolina.
The figure also may reflect initial claims filed * by striking Nynex Corp. workers who *T*-1 have become eligible for unemployment benefits, the official said 0 *T*-2.
I was appalled *PRO*-1 to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial "Colombia's Brave Publisher."
It is the right - wing guerrillas who *T*-2 are aligned *-1 with the drug traffickers, not the left wing.
This information was gleaned *-1 from your own news stories on the region.
Past Colombian government tolerance of the "narcotraficantes" was due to the drug lords' history of *PRO* wiping out leftists in the hinterlands.
Mary Poulin Palo Alto, Calif.
I suggest that The Wall Street Journal (as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind) should put its money where its mouth is *T*-1: *PRO* Lend computer equipment *PRO*-2 to replace that damaged * at El Espectador, buy ad space, publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists.
Perhaps an arrangement *ICH*-2 could be worked *-1 out *PRO* to "sponsor" El Espectador journalists and staff by *PRO*-3 paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories.
*PRO* Reward El Espectador's courage with real support.

Steel jackets of a type that *T*-2 may have prevented collapse of the columns of a 1.5-mile stretch of the Nimitz Freeway had been installed *-1 on at least a small test section of the double - decker highway last year by California's Department of Transportation, employees familiar with the project say 0 *T*-3.
The test project--which *T*-1 reportedly survived Tuesday's earthquake--was a prelude to a state plan *PRO* to retrofit that critical section of the freeway with the steel casings.
State engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns, wrenched * and separated * from the double - decker roadbed, that *T*-1 was responsible for the collapse.
The failure in Oakland of the freeway segment known * as the Cypress structure was the deadliest aspect of the quake, although officials were hopeful *ICH*-1 yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the 250 initially feared *.
*PRO* Sorting out the wreckage is expected *PRO*-1 to take several days.
Red tractors gingerly picked at the rubble while jackhammers tried *PRO*-1 to break up some of the massive slabs of concrete.
Giant yellow cranes were wheeled *-1 up alongside the collapsed segment, *PRO*-3 preparing *PRO*-2 to lift off chunks of the debris.
In Sacramento, a transportation department spokesman said 0 he couldn't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work.
However, he asserted that the department hadn't mastered the technology needed * *PRO* to retrofit the entire Cypress structure.
Moreover, other officials noted *?*, snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced *T*-2 over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting, even if it were technologically feasible.
Knowledgeable employees said 0 the retrofitting, which *T*-2 hadn't yet been budgeted *-1, was part of a planned, three - stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun * by the California transportation department several years ago.
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort *PRO* to shore up structures believed *PRO* vulnerable to earthquakes.
The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California, when numerous bridges collapsed *T*-1.
"We had just finished phase two" of the Cypress project that *T*-1 involved *PRO* installing a series of retaining cables designed * 0 *T*-3 to prevent sections of the roadway from *PRO*-2 separating as a result of seismic shock, a state DOT engineer said 0 *T*-4.
After *PRO*-1 completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers 0 *T*-2 to draw up a final design.
Knowledgeable employees said 0 the project had been stymied *-1 somewhat by "the difficulty of *PRO* designing" the jackets.
The procedure involves *PRO* encasing the concrete columns with steel, then connecting them more securely to the double - decker roadbed.
The employees also said 0 the project may have been snagged *-1 by budgetary concerns.
One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as $50 million *U*.
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials.
Gov. George Deukmejian, who *T*-2 said 0 he had been assured *-1 by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake, called for an immediate investigation.
"I want *PRO*-3 to know who *T*-1 made the decision that it *EXP*-4 was safe for 186,000 people to use every day," said *T*-5 Richard Katz, a state legislator who *T*-2 is chairman of the California Assembly's transportation committee.
He said 0 he would convene hearings within two weeks.
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957, and as such, like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area, does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support.
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that *T*-1 were of a type 0 *T*-2 to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake.
Transportation department officials, however, said 0 they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction.
They said 0 previous earthquakes suggested that multiple - column viaducts would stand up well, although they were working on ways 0 *PRO* to bolster them *T*-1.
"Unfortunately, there is only one laboratory for *PRO* developing techniques 0 *PRO* to withstand earthquakes *T*-1, and that is an earthquake," said *T*-2 Burch Bachtold, San Francisco district director for the transportation department.
He said: "We know of no technology that *T*-1 exists anywhere in the world that *T*-2 would allow us to" reinforce the columns.
Former Democratic fund - raiser Thomas M. Gaubert, whose savings and loan *T*-3 was wrested *-2 from his control by federal thrift regulators, has been granted *-1 court permission *PRO* to sue the regulators.
In a ruling by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Mr. Gaubert received the go - ahead *PRO* to pursue a claim against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas for losses 0 he suffered *T*-1 when the Bank Board closed the Independent American Savings Association of Irving, Texas *T*-2.
Mr. Gaubert, who *T*-1 was chairman and the majority stockholder of Independent American, had relinquished his control in exchange for federal regulators' agreement *PRO* to drop their inquiry into his activities at another savings and loan.
As part of the agreement, Mr. Gaubert contributed real estate valued * at $25 million *U* to the assets of Independent American.
While *PRO*-1 under the control of federal regulators, Independent American's net worth dropped from $75 million *U* to a negative $400 million *U*, *PRO* wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's real estate contribution and his stock in the institution.
Mr. Gaubert's suit *PRO* to recover his damages was dismissed *-1 last year by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which *T*-2 offers broad protection for actions by federal agencies and employees.
Earlier this week, a Fifth Circuit appellate panel upheld Judge Maloney's dismissal of Mr. Gaubert's claim as a shareholder but said 0 the judge should reconsider Mr. Gaubert's claim for the loss of his property.
"It may depend on whether there was an express or implied promise...that the federal officials would not negligently cause the deterioration" of Independent American, the court wrote 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Gaubert's lawyer, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., says 0 the impact of the ruling on other cases involving thrift takeovers will depend on the degree of similarity in the facts.
"I don't know if this will affect one institution or a hundred," Mr. Lowell says *T*-1.
"It does establish a very clear precedent for *PRO* suing the FHLBB where there was none before *T*-1."
MAITRE'D CLAIMS in suit that restaurant fired her because she was pregnant.
In a suit filed * in state court in Manhattan, the American Civil Liberties Union is representing the former maitre'd of the chic Odeon restaurant.
The suit, which *T*-1 seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $1 million *U*, alleges that the firing of Marcia Trees Levine violated New York state's human - rights law.
Among other things, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy.
The suit alleges that Ms. Levine was fired *-1 after she refused *PRO*-2 to accept a lower paying, less visible job upon *PRO*-3 reaching her sixth month of pregnancy.
Ms. Levine told her employer that she was pregnant in February; a month later, the suit says 0 *?*, the restaurant manager told Ms. Levine that she would be demoted *-1 to his assistant because he felt 0 customers would be uncomfortable with a pregnant maitre'd.
Kary Moss, an attorney with the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, said, "They wanted a svelte - looking woman, and a pregnant woman is not svelte.
They told her, ` We don't hire fat people and we don't hire cripples.
And pregnant women are fat."'
Ms. Moss said 0 Ms. Levine secretly taped many conversations with her bosses at the Odeon in which they told her 0 she was being fired as maitre'd because she was pregnant *T*-1.
Paul H. Aloe, an attorney for Odeon owner Keith McNally, denied the allegations.
He said 0 Ms. Levine had never been fired *-1, although she had stopped *-2 working at the restaurant.
"The Odeon made a written offer *ICH*-1 to Marcia Levine on July 10 *PRO* to return to work as the maitre'd, at the same pay, same hours and with back pay accrued *," he said *T*-2.
Mr. Aloe said 0 the Odeon "has no policy against *PRO* hiring pregnant people."
LAWYERS IN Texas's biggest bank - fraud case want out in face of retrial.
Lawyers representing five of the seven defendants in the case say 0 their clients can no longer afford their services.
The trial of the case lasted seven months and ended in September with a hung jury.
The defendants were indicted *-1 two years ago on charges that they conspired *PRO*-2 to defraud five thrifts of more than $130 million *U* through a complicated scheme *PRO* to inflate the price of land and condominium construction along Interstate 30, east of Dallas.
The defense lawyers, three of whom *T*-1 are solo practitioners, say 0 they can't afford *PRO*-2 to put their law practices on hold for another seven - month trial.
Some of the lawyers say 0 they would continue *-1 to represent their clients if the government pays their tab as court - appointed lawyers.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Hart of Dallas says 0 the government will oppose any efforts *PRO* to bring in a new defense team because it would delay a retrial.
FEDERAL JUDGE ALCEE HASTINGS of Florida, *PRO*-1 facing impeachment, received an unanticipated boost yesterday.
Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa .) urged acquittal of the judge in a brief circulated * to his Senate colleagues during closed - door deliberations.
Among other things, the brief cited insufficient evidence.
Sen. Specter was vice chairman of the impeachment trial committee that *T*-1 heard evidence in the Hastings case last summer.
*PRO*-1 A former prosecutor and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Specter is expected *-1 to exercise influence when the Senate votes on the impeachment today *T*-2.

For Vietnamese, these are tricky, often treacherous, times.
After years of hesitation, economic and political reform was embraced *-1 at the end of 1986, but ringing declarations have yet *-3 to be translated *-2 into much action.
Vietnam is finding that *PRO* turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market doesn't come easy.
Here is *T*-1 how three Vietnamese are coping with change *T*-2:
The Tire King
Nguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard.
Mr. Chan used *-2 to be an oddity in Hanoi: a private entrepreneur.
His business success made him an official target in pre-reform days.
Mr. Chan, now 64 years old, invented a fountain pen 0 he and his family produced *T*-1 from plastic waste.
Later, he marketed glue.
Both products were immensely popular.
For his troubles, Mr. Chan was jailed *-1 three times between 1960 and 1974.
Though his operation was registered *-2 and used only scrap, he was accused *-1 of *PRO*-3 conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials.
Once he was held *-1 for three months without *PRO*-1 being charged *-2.
Things were supposed *-1 to change when Vietnam's economic reforms gathered pace *T*-2, and for awhile they did *?*.
After years of experimenting, Mr. Chan produced a heavy - duty bicycle tire that *T*-1 outlasted its state - produced rival.
By 1982, he was selling thousands of tires.
Newspapers published articles about him, and he was hailed *-1 as "the tire king."
His efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition--and attracted renewed attention from local authorities.
District police in 1983 descended on his suburban home, which he and his large family used *T*-1 as both residence and factory, and demanded proof 0 the house and equipment were his.
He produced it.
"That was the first time 0 they lost and I won *T*-1," he says *T*-2.
He was further questioned *-1 *PRO* to determine if he was "a real working man or an exploiter."
Says *ICH*-2 Mr. Chan: "When I showed 0 it was from my own brain *T*-1, they lost for the second time."
But a few days later the police accused him of *PRO*-1 stealing electricity, acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property.
*PRO*-2 Warned *-3 0 he was *-4 to be jailed *-1 again, he fled to the countryside.
His family was given *-1 three hours 0 *PRO* to leave *T*-3 before the house and contents were confiscated *-2.
With only the clothes 0 they were wearing *T*-1, family members moved to a home owned * by one of Mr. Chan's sons.
After six months on the run, Mr. Chan learned 0 the order for his arrest had been canceled *-1.
He rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice, *PRO*-1 pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights.
He and his family kept afloat by *PRO*-1 repairing bicycles, selling fruit and doing odd jobs.
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987--and became a minor celebrity again--when his story was published *-1 in a weekly newspaper *T*-2.
In 1988, 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family - run private enterprise, district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work.
By late last year he was invited *-1 back as "the tire king" *PRO*-1 to display his products at a national exhibition.
National leaders stopped by his stand *PRO*-1 to commend his achievements.
Mr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire - patching glue in the son's small house.
Eighteen people *ICH*-1 pack the house's two rooms--the Chans, four of their 10 children with spouses, and eight of 22 grandchildren.
Most sleep on the floor.
Come daybreak, eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that *T*-1 covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street.
The primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard, where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled *-1 in a bathtub filled * with water *T*-2.
Mr. Chan talks optimistically of *PRO* expanding, maybe even moving into the import - export field.
First, however, he has unfinished business.
When district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing *T*-1, they released only one of his machines.
They didn't return the rubber stocks that *T*-1 represent his capital.
Nor did they return his house and contents, which he values *T*-1 at about $44,000 *U*.
He wants *PRO*-1 to recover more than just his property, though.
"I want my dignity back," he says *T*-1.
The Editor
Nguyen Ngoc seemed *-3 an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor 0 *T*-2 to reform its weekly newspaper, Van Nghe *T*-1.
After the sixth congress, journalists seized the opportunity provided * by the liberalization *PRO*-1 to probe previously taboo subjects.
Mr. Ngoc, 57 years old, had solid reformist credentials: He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature.
*PRO*-1 Appointed editor in chief in July 1987, Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam's hottest paper.
Circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes *PRO*-1 to cover Vietnamese society and its ills.
Readers were electrified *-1 by the paper's audacity and appalled *-1 by the dark side of life 0 it uncovered *T*-2.
One article recounted a decade - long struggle *ICH*-1 by a wounded soldier *PRO* to prove, officially, 0 he was alive.
Another described how tax - collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers *T*-1.
The newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep, a former history teacher, who *T*-1 stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who *T*-2 had blocked his entry into their official association.
Van Nghe quickly made influential enemies.
"Those who *T*-1 manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly" to the restyled paper, says 0 *T*-2 Lai Nguyen An, a literary critic.
After months of internal rumblings, Mr. Ngoc was fired *-1 last December.
His dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that *T*-1 continues today.
"Under Mr. Ngoc, Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government," says *T*-2 Nguyen Duy, a poet who *T*-1 is the paper's bureau chief for southern Vietnam.
"The paper reflected the truth.
For the leadership, that was too painful 0 *PRO* to bear *T*-1."
The ` Billionaire '
Nguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam's entrepreneur of the 1980s.
Her challenge is *PRO* to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s.
Mrs. Thi didn't wait for the reforms *PRO*-1 to get her start.
She charged ahead of the government and the law *PRO*-1 to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country.
Her success, which *T*-1 included *PRO* alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s, helped persuade Hanoi *PRO*-2 to take the reform path.
Her story is becoming part of local folklore.
A lifelong revolutionary with little education who *T*-1 fought both the French and the U.S. - backed Saigon regime, she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war.
Her instincts were capitalistic, despite her background.
As she rode over regulations, only her friendship with party leaders, including Nguyen Van Linh, then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary, kept her out of jail.
Following Mr. Linh's appointment as secretary - general of the party at the sixth congress, Mrs. Thi has become the darling of "doi moi", the Vietnamese version of perestroika.
The authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office *PRO*-1 to see an example of "the new way of thinking."
Foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam's richest woman.
"Some people call me *PRO*-2 the communist billionaire," she has told visitors *T*-1.
Actually, 67 - year - old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land.
She has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate, but the company itself remains state - owned.
She manages it with the title of general - director.
The heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities, such as corn and coffee, from farmers in the south, *PRO* paying with fertilizer, farm tools and other items.
Last year, Hochiminh City Food says 0 it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice, more than 10% of the country's output.
The company operates a fleet of trucks and boats 0 *T*-1 to transport the commodities to its warehouses.
A subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that *T*-2 are sold *-1 with the rice through a vast retail network.
In recent years, Mrs. Thi has started *-2 to diversify the company, *PRO*-2 taking a 20% stake in newly established, partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank, and setting up Saigon Petro, which *T*-1 owns and operates Vietnam's first oil refinery.
Mrs. Thi says 0 Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60% to the equivalent of about $2.7 million *U* on sales of $150 million *U*.
She expects both revenue and profit to gain this year.
She is almost cavalier about the possibility 0 Vietnam's reforms will create rivals on her home turf.
"I don't mind the competition inside the country," she says *T*-1.
"I am only afraid that with Vietnam's poor - quality products we can't compete with neighboring countries.
Investors celebrated the second anniversary of Black Monday with a buying spree in both stocks and bonds.
But the dollar was mixed.
Stock and bond investors were cheered *-1 by last month's encouragingly low inflation rate.
This news raised hopes for further interest - rate cuts.
Treasury - bond prices immediately rallied, *PRO* setting the stock market rolling from the opening bell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up about 60 points in mid-afternoon, finished with a gain of 39.55 points, to 2683.20.
That brought the average's cumulative gain this week to about 114 points.
Since the 1987 crash, the industrials have soared more than 54%, and the widely watched market barometer is about 4% below its record high set * earlier this month.
The stock - market rally was led *-1 by blue - chip issues, but, unlike Monday's rebound, was broadly based.
Indeed, over - the - counter stocks, led * by technology issues, outleaped the industrial average.
The Nasdaq Composite Index soared 7.52, or 1.6%, to 470.80, its highest one - day jump in points this year.
Many takeover - related stocks rose after news that a group obtained financing commitments for the proposed buy - out of American Medical International Inc.
Among the biggest winners were *T*-1 brokerage - house stocks, *PRO*-2 responding to heavy trading volume.
The government said 0 consumer prices rose only 0.2% last month.
Economists expected twice as large an increase.
That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure *ICH*-1 on the Federal Reserve *PRO* to ease credit further, which *T*-2 in turn would be good news for stocks, investment managers say 0 *T*-3.
"I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means 0 my interest - rate outlook has a downward tilt," said *T*-1 Garnett L. Keith Jr., vice chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, one of the nation's largest institutional investors.
Fed officials probably won't drive down rates immediately, Mr. Keith said 0 *T*-1.
Despite the inflation news, several Fed officials still fear 0 consumer - price pressures will intensify because they insist 0 the economy is stronger than *PRO* generally believed.
But Wall Street analysts expect further signs of economic weakness in government reports during the next few weeks.
If so, that will cinch the case for another shot of credit - easing within a month or so.
That, in turn, is expected *-1 to persuade banks *PRO*-2 to cut their prime lending rate, a benchmark rate on many corporate and consumer loans, by half a percentage point, to 10%.
"We're not out of the woods yet by any means," said *T*-1 George R. Mateyo, president and chief executive of Carnegie Capital Management Co., Cleveland.
But the economy "is slowing enough 0 *T*-1 to give the Federal Reserve leeway 0 *PRO* to reduce interest rates *T*-2."
But many individual investors are leery about stocks because of fresh signs of fragility in the huge junk - bond market.
Investors also are anxious about today's "witching hour," the monthly expiration of stock - index futures and options, and options on individual stocks.
This phenomenon often makes stock prices swing wildly at the end of the trading session.
In major market activity: Stock prices surged in heavy trading.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 198.1 million shares from 166.9 million Wednesday.
Gaining Big Board issues outnumbered decliners by 1,235 to 355.
The dollar was mixed.
In New York late yesterday, it was at 141.70 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday.
But it fell to 1.8470 marks from 1.8485.
James F. Gero, former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc., and Richard J. Hatchett III, a Dallas investment banker, were elected *-1 *PRO*-2 directors of this medical - products concern, *PRO* boosting the board to seven members.
Consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2% in September, *PRO*-1 pushed *-2 up mostly by a jump in clothing costs, the Labor Department reported 0 *T*-3.
Energy costs, which *T*-1 drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month, continued *-2 to decline at the retail level, *PRO*-2 pulling down transportation and helping *PRO*-3 to ease housing costs.
The report was the brightest news 0 the financial markets had seen *T*-1 since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news, *PRO*-1 closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20.
Bond prices also jumped as traders appeared *-1 to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall.
But many economists were not nearly as jubilant.
The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain *-1 to push up retail energy prices in the next few months, they warned 0 *T*-2.
They also said 0 the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that *T*-1 helped *PRO*-2 to reduce the prices of imported goods.
"I think 0 inflation is going *-2 to pick up through the fall," said *T*-3 Joel Popkin, a specialist on inflation who *T*-1 runs an economic consulting firm here.
"It has been in what I would describe *T*-1 as a lull for the past several months."
"We've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months, and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now," said *T*-1 Jay Woodworth, chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York.
Because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5% last month, many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too.
As a result, many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did *?*.
But retail energy prices declined 0.9% in September.
Though analysts say 0 competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices, many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed *-1 along to the consumer before the end of the year.
Still, some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind.
"It increasingly appears that 1987 - 88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem," argued *T*-1 Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
In both 1987 and 1988, consumer prices rose 4.4%.
A run - up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7% annual rate in the first five months of this year, but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4%.
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue *-1 to restrain prices.
"The bottom line is, 0 it seems to me that the economic environment has become very, very competitve for a lot of businesses," he said *T*-1.
"Back in 1987 - 88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt 0 they could raise prices."
Now, he said 0 *?*, a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand.
The mild inflation figures renewed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest - rate stance.
The steep climb in producer prices reported * last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market's 6.9% plunge that day.
In the past several days, however, the U.S.'s central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to stabilize the markets.
Analysts say 0 Fed policy makers have been wary of *PRO*-1 relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy.
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food--*PRO* leaving what some economists call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 the core inflation rate--consumer prices still rose only 0.2% in September.
Transportation costs actually fell 0.5%, and housing costs gained only 0.1%.
Apparel prices rocketed up 1.7%, but that was after three months of declines.
Medical costs continued their steep ascent, *PRO*-1 rising 0.8% after four consecutive months of 0.7% increases.
Car prices, another area that *T*-1 contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month, still showed declines at the consumer level.
They dropped 0.4% as dealers continued *-1 to offer rebates 0 *T*-2 to attract customers.
Food prices rose 0.2% for the second month in a row, far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year.
Separately, the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3% in September, after *PRO* adjusting for inflation, following a 0.7% decline in August.
All the numbers are adjusted *-1 for seasonal fluctuations.
Here are *T*-1 the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for September.
A House - Senate conference approved a nearly $17 billion *U* State, Justice and Commerce Department bill that *T*-1 makes federal reparations for Japanese - Americans held * in World War II internment camps a legal entitlement after next Oct. 1.
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to *PRO*-1 meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million *U* until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion *U* is paid *-2.
The action abandons earlier efforts *PRO* to find offsetting cuts 0 *T*-1 to fund the payments, but is widely seen *-2 as a more realistic means of *PRO* expediting reparations first authorized * in 1988.
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion *U* for the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services.
Final approval was on a 67 - 31 roll call in the Senate, which *T*-32 sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women.
*PRO*-1 Reversing an eight - year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. Bush has so far refused *PRO*-2 to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger *T*-3.
Mr. Bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote *PRO* to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed * in the underlying bill.
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990.
An estimated $1.32 billion *U* *ICH*-2 is provided *-1 for next year's census, and negotiators stripped a Senate - passed rider seeking *PRO* to block the counting of illegal aliens.
Elsewhere in the Commerce Department, nearly $191.2 million *U* *ICH*-2 is preserved *-1 for assistance programs under the Economic Development Administration.
And in a footnote to the fall of House Speaker James Wright this year, the conference voted *PRO*-2 to rescind $11.8 million *U* in unspent EDA funds for a Fort Worth, Texas, stockyards project that *T*-1 figured in ethics charges against the former Democratic leader.
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged * by federal agencies, and an 18% increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget would be financed *-1 entirely by an added $26 million *U* in filing fees.
In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million *U* in receipts by *PRO*-2 having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases--a change that *T*-1 is almost certain *-3 to increase Pentagon costs in *PRO* processing personnel and security clearances.
The bill doesn't include an estimated $1.9 billion *U* in supplemental anti-drug funds for Justice Department and law - enforcement accounts that *T*-1 are still in conference with the House.
But yesterday's agreement would make it *EXP*-1 easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by *PRO*-2 deferring for one year a scheduled 50% increase in the required state matching funds for law - enforcement grants.
Similarly, the measure adjusts the current funding formula *PRO*-1 to promise smaller states such as New Hampshire and Delaware a minimum allocation of $1.6 million *U* each in drug grants, or three times the current minimum.
The odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more eclectic of the annual appropriations measures, and the assorted provisions attached * by lawmakers run from $1.5 million *U* for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency.
Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million *U* State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville, Spain, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 *U* for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger.
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), who *T*-1 also chairs the Senate appropriations subcommittee for the department, attached $10 million *U* for an advanced technology initiative, including work on high - definition television.
His Republican counterpart, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), has used his position *PRO*-1 to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp.
An estimated $321 million *U* is provided *-2 *PRO*-3 to maintain the program, but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in *PRO*-4 attaching language seeking *PRO* to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed *-1.
The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed *-1 until Oct. 1 next year, and the bill seeks *PRO*-2 to reverse efforts *ICH*-3 by the corporation *PRO* to cut off funds to service organizations such as the Food Research and Action Center.
The bill also provides $620.5 million *U* 0 *T*-1 to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $80 million *U* for peace - keeping activities.
Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989, although the amount for peace - keeping shows a 27% cut from the administration's request.
Directors of state - owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two - step capital - boosting transaction and a change in the bank's rules that *T*-1 will help it *PRO*-2 operate more like a private - sector institution.
Until now, BNL's top managers and its directors have been appointed *-1 by a Treasury decree.
But under the bank's proposed statutes, an assembly of shareholders must approve board members.
The bank's chairman and director general, who *T*-2 also sit on the board, still would be appointed *-1 by the Treasury.
BNL, which *T*-3 is controlled *-2 by the Italian Treasury, was rocked *-1 by the disclosure *ICH*-4 last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $3 billion *U* in unauthorized credits to Iraq.
The ensuing scandal, in which the bank's management resigned *T*-2, has helped *PRO* renew calls for privatization, or at least an overhaul, of Italy's banking system, which *T*-1 is about 80% state - controlled.
In a related move, the bank also proposed that board representation be linked *-1 more closely to the bank's new shareholding structure.
BNL called a shareholders' assembly meeting in December *PRO* to vote on the proposals.
BNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that *T*-2 are listed *-1 on the Milan Stock Exchange.
The shares were suspended *-1 from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal; Consob, the stock exchange regulatory body, reportedly will decide soon whether *PRO*-2 to end the trading suspension.
Ko Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader's Digest.
"Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news," says *T*-1 Mr. Shioya.
"But one gets fed up with *PRO*-1 importing information and news."
Mr. Shioya has turned the tables.
Today, he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine, the first English - language business magazine devoted * to coverage of Japanese business.
After a slick redesign, the two - year - old magazine has been relaunched *-1 this month by its parent company, Keizaikai Corp., the Tokyo - based company with interests that *T*-2 include financial services, book publishing and a tourist agency.
*PRO*-1 Printed * in the U.S. and carrying the line "The Insider's Japan," Business Tokyo's October cover story was "The World's No. 1 Customer"--Japanese women.
Keizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing, after *PRO* making major investments in entertainment, real estate and banking companies here.
Japanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers 0 *T*-1 to study the U.S. market, including the New York - based investment banker Veronis, Suhler & Associates.
And they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups.
"Japanese publishers want *PRO*-2 to be introduced *-1 to the publishing and information industries," said *T*-3 John Veronis, chairman of Veronis Suhler.
While there aren't any major deals *ICH*-1 in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp.'s recent $3.4 billion *U* agreement *PRO* to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., observers don't rule out a transaction of that size.
"The Japanese take the long view ." said *T*-1 Mr. Veronis.
"It may not be weeks or months, but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable, they will move on a deal," he said *T*-1.
In recent months, three big Tokyo - based publishing concerns--including Nikkei Business Publications, Nikkei Home (no relation), and Magazine House--applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America, which *T*-1 represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines.
Japanese involvement in American publishing has been so small *ICH*-2 to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered *-1 groundbreakers.
When Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 *T*-1, it appealed to a more multinational audience.
The magazine was overhauled *-1 with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard, and targets top - level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers.
American publishers appear more than ready *PRO*-1 to do some selling.
Susumu Ohara, president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc., publisher of the Japan Economic Journal, said 0 he receives telephone calls *ICH*-1 weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in *PRO*-2 buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine.
"The Japanese are in the early stage right now," said *T*-3 Thomas Kenney, a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who *T*-2 was recently appointed *-1 *PRO*-4 president of Reader's Digest Association's new Magazine Publishing Group.
"Before, they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft.
Now they realize 0 magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise.
Your Oct. 12 editorial "Pitiful, Helpless Presidency?" correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration's failure *PRO* to have any plan *ICH*-1 in place *PRO* to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities *PRO* to oust Manuel Noriega presented * by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3.
You are absolutely wrong, however, in *PRO* opining that this position is some kind of "flip - flop," something newly arrived at * as a result of *PRO* reading the opinion polls.
My position is one founded * on both the facts and the law.
Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is *T*-1 in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative).
The public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings 0 I chaired *T*-1 in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8, 9, 10 and 11, 1988, and again on April 4, 1988.
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega's criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies *T*-1.
Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able *PRO*-1 to use his relationships with these agencies *PRO*-3 to delay U.S. action against him, and to exploit the administration's obsession with *PRO* overthrowing the Sandinistas *PRO*-4 to protect his own drug - dealing *T*-2.
As former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee, the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics, but made a decision *ICH*-1 in the summer of 1986 "*PRO* to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled *-2."
As the report issued * by the subcommittee concluded, "Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war.
This decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war."
Unfortunately, this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega's indictment.
Throughout 1988 and this year, I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. *PRO*-1 to develop a plan for *PRO* pushing this "narcokleptocrat" out of Panama.
Regrettably, two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable *PRO*-1 to develop any plan, military or economic, for *PRO* supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts *PRO* to restore democracy.

Melvin Belli's San Francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after Tuesday's earthquake.
In the first 25 minutes after his office's telephone service was restored *-1 yesterday morning, 17 potential clients had called *PRO*-2 seeking the services of the self - proclaimed King of Torts.
Mr. Belli, like many other personal - injury lawyers, suspects that the earthquake, which *T*-1 measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, will generate enough lawsuits 0 *T*-2 to keep this city's personal - injury and construction lawyers *PRO*-3 busy for quite some time.
Suits are likely *-2 to be filed *-1 against engineering firms, contractors and developers, as well as against local - government agencies.
But lawyers looking *PRO* to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge.
Experts on California tort law say 0 protections afforded * government agencies in such cases are pretty ironclad.
Even claims against individuals and companies face significant roadblocks.
The major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held *-1 liable for an "act of God."
For now, says 0 *?* Laurence Drivon, president - elect of the 6,000 - member California Trial Lawyers Association, "the last thing 0 we really need *-2 to worry about *T*-1 is whether anybody is going *-3 to get sued, or whether they have liability or not.
We still have people wandering around in a daze in San Francisco *PRO*-1 worrying about whether it's going *-2 to rain tonight."
But that won't stop plaintiffs' lawyers from *PRO*-1 seeking a little room for maneuvering.
In San Francisco, they argue 0 *?*, an earthquake was a near certainty.
Therefore, engineering firms, construction contractors and developers can be sued *-1 for *PRO*-4 not keeping structures up to standard, and government agencies can be held *-2 accountable for *PRO* failing *-5 to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster, if negligence can be proven *-3.
"My prediction is 0 there will be mass litigation over errors and omissions in engineering and contracting," says *T*-1 Stanley Chesley, a well - known Cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer.
From what he saw *T*-2 on television, Mr. Chesley points out that Interstate 880, which *T*-1 collapsed and killed more than 200 commuters, suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared *-3 to sustain no damage whatsoever.
He adds that "they were aware of the propensity for earthquakes and the San Andreas Fault."
The flamboyant and publicity - conscious Mr. Belli says 0 he already has investigators looking into who *T*-2 could be held *-1 liable for the damage on the Bay Bridge and the interstate approaching it.
"We won't know until the smoke clears--but yes, we're looking into it," he says *T*-1.
Mr. Belli says 0 he wants *PRO*-1 to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage.
Mr. Belli, who *T*-1 was at Candlestick Park for the World Series Tuesday night, says 0 he has hired civil engineers *PRO*-2 to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse.
Defense lawyers, perhaps understandably, say that plaintiffs' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in *PRO* pursuing their claims, though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at *-1 individually.
"A lot of this is going *-1 to be code - related," says *T*-2 Ignazio J. Ruvolo, a construction law specialist at Bronson, Bronson & McKinnon, a San Francisco law firm.
Plaintiffs, he says 0 *?*, will argue that damaged structures weren't built *-1 to proper design standards.
But if defendants can prove that they met San Francisco's stringent building codes, "that's probably going *-1 to protect them," Mr. Ruvolo says 0 *T*-2.
Government entities, continues 0 *?* Mr. Ruvolo, could be protected *-1 by the California Government Tort Liability Act.
Under the statute, agencies are provided *-1 "defenses that *T*-2 normally aren't available in the private sector," Mr. Ruvolo says 0 *T*-3.
"The legislature does not want *PRO*-1 to inhibit the unique government activities by *PRO*-2 exposing public entities to liability."
Built *-4 into the statute are *T*-3 so - called design immunities, which *T*-1 are likely *-5 to protect government agencies, according to Mr. Ruvolo and Richard Covert, a lawyer with the California Department of Transportation, which *T*-2 oversees the damaged Bay Bridge.
The state is protected *-1 when plans and designs for public structures were approved *-2 ahead of time *T*-3 or when structures met previously approved standards *T*-4, says 0 *T*-5 Mr. Covert.
He believes 0 those defenses might well apply to the Bay Bridge collapse.
Nevertheless, he adds, "I wouldn't get totally shocked *-1 if we get lawsuits out of the Bay Bridge."
If there's going *-1 to be a race to the courthouse, it hasn't started yet.
Mr. Covert had *-2 to search through law books scattered * on the floor of his office yesterday, and Mr. Belli's courtyard was strewn *-1 with bricks.
Wednesday, Mr. Belli's staff wasn't permitted *-1 into his office by city officials worried * about their safety.
He said 0 he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his town - house office and helped victims apply for federal aid--free of charge.
In a news release issued * by Mr. Drivon, the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims.
The association said 0 it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is unethical.
Stock - market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money - market mutual fund assets up $6.07 billion *U* in the latest week, the sharpest increase in almost two years.
The 473 funds tracked * by the Investment Company Institute, a Washington - based trade group, rose to $356.1 billion *U*, a record.
The $6.07 billion *U* increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988.
The increase was spread *-1 fairly evenly among all three types of funds.
Individual investors, represented * in the general - purpose and broker - dealer fund categories, pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds, said 0 *T*-1 Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Institute.
"Insitutional investors, on the other hand, reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money - market instruments following the stock - market decline last Friday," Mr. Dreyer said *T*-1.
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.
The average seven - day compounded yield fell to 8.55% from 8.60% the week earlier, Donoghue's said 0 *T*-1.
At the auction of six - month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday, the average yield fell to 7.61% from 7.82%.
Likewise, certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday.
The 142 institutional - type money funds rose $2.23 billion *U* to $85.49 billion *U*.
The 235 general - purpose funds increased $2.53 billion *U* to $116.56 billion *U*, while 96 broker - dealer funds increased $1.3 billion *U* to $154.05 billion *U*.
Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch, only a few steps from the very top of the stands.
From my orange seat, I looked over the first - base line and the new - mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what *T*-1 was *-2 to have been the third game of the World Series.
It was five in the afternoon, but that was Pacific time.
Back in New York the work day was already over, so I didn't have *-1 to feel guilty.
Even still, I did feel self - indulgent, and I couldn't help *PRO*-2 remembering my father's contempt for a rich medical colleague who *T*-1 would go *PRO*-3 to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons.
This ballpark, the Stick, was not a classic baseball stadium--too symmetrical, too much bald concrete.
And it didn't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium.
But I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me, liked it that they'd brought their children, found it *EXP*-1 charming that, *PRO*-2 true citizens of the state of the future, they had brought so many TVs and radios *PRO*-2 to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event.
Maybe it was their peculiar sense of history.
The broadcasters were, after all, documenting the game, ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick.
Why not watch or hear your experience historicized *-1 while you were living it?
The day was saturated *-1 with the weight of its own impending history.
Long lines of people waited *PRO*-1 to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks.
Thousands of us had paid $5 *U* for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia, its historical photographs of great moments in Series past, and its instructions, in English and Spanish, for *PRO* filling in the scorecard.
Pitcher = lanzador.
Homerun = jonron.
Players ran out on the field way below, and the stands began *-1 to reverberate.
It must be a local custom *ICH*-3, I thought 0 *?*, *PRO* stamping feet *PRO*-1 to welcome the team.
But then the noise turned into a roar.
And no one was shouting.
No one around me was saying anything.
Because we all were busy *PRO*-1 riding a wave.
Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall, waiting for the wipeout.
Only at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what *T*-1 was going on.
Then I remembered the quake of '71, which I experienced *T*-1 in Santa Barbara in a second - story motel room.
When the swaying of the building woke me up *T*-2, I reasoned that a) I was in Southern California; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that *T*-1 had short - circuited.
Then I noticed 0 the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what *T*-1 had happened.
What should I do *T*-1?
*PRO* Get out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot.
But the lot might split into crevasses, so I had better stand on my car, which *T*-1 probably was wider than the average crevasse.
Fortunately, the quake was over before I managed *PRO*-1 to run out and stand *PRO*-2 naked on the hood.
At the Stick, while the world shook, I thought of that morning and then it *EXP*-1 struck me that this time was different.
If I survived, I would have achieved every journalist's highest wish.
I was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment.
What *T*-1 was my angle?
How would I file *T*-1?
All these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake's actual duration.
The rest is, of course, history.
The Stick didn't fall.
The real tragedies occurred elsewhere, as we soon found out.
But for a few minutes there, relief abounded.
A young mother found her boy, who *T*-1 had been out *PRO*-2 buying a hotdog.
The wall behind me was slightly deformed, but the center had held.
And most of us waited for a while for the game to start.
Then we began *-1 to file out, *PRO*-1 to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch.
It was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen *T*-1.
The crowd moved in clumps, clumps magnetized * around an electronic nucleus.
In this way, while the Stick itself was blacked *-1 out, we kept up to date on events.
Within 15 minutes of the quake itself, I was able *PRO*-1 to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge.
Increasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car.
And by then, expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay *PRO*-2 informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke 0 we saw *T*-1 on the northern horizon.
Darkness fell.
But the broadcasts continued through the blacked - out night, with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district.
By then, our little sand village of cars had been linked *-1 with a global village of listeners and viewers.
Everyone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant.
In fact, the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience.
The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters.
The outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who *T*-1 had the presence of mind 0 *PRO* to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway *T*-2.
The tape was on tv before the night was out.
Marshall McLuhan, you should have been there at that hour.
The television units of Paramount Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. are exploring the possibility of *PRO* offering prime - time programming to independent stations two nights a week, industry executives say 0 *T*-1.
Although such a venture wouldn't match the "fourth network" created * by News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions.
Fox, which *T*-1 also owns six TV stations, provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates.
Paramount Domestic TV and MCA TV formed a joint venture *ICH*-1 *ICH*-4 last month, named * *PRO*-2 Premier Advertiser Sales, 0 *T*-3 to sell advertising in programs syndicated * by both companies, such as "Star Trek: the Next Generation," "Charles in Charge" and "Friday the 13th: the Series."
A spokeswoman for Paramount said 0 the company doesn't comment on speculation.
Calls to Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV, weren't returned *-2.
The two companies, like Fox, already have their own TV stations.
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed *PRO*-1 to purchase a 79% stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued * at $140 million *U*.
TVX owns five stations, including WTXF, a Fox affiliate, in Philadelphia.
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said 0 the co-venture would target stations affiliated * with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities.
Currently, Fox supplies programs on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, although the company plans *PRO*-1 to expand to other weeknights.
Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said, "We believe 0 the partnership of Fox, its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue *-1 to grow."
Another Fox official, who *T*-3 declined *PRO* to be identified *-1, said 0 Fox wasn't pleased *-2 by the possible Paramount - MCA venture into prime - time programming.
"*PRO*-1 To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates," he said *T*-2.
"We spent a lot of time and money in *PRO*-1 building our group of stations," he said *T*-2, *PRO*-3 adding that Fox doesn't "appreciate" another company attempting *PRO*-4 to usurp its station lineup.
Fox said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to offer its stations movies, theatrical and made - for - TV ventures, probably on Wednesdays, sometime next year.
It is also planning another night of original series.
Paramount and MCA, according to the broadcasting executive, plan *PRO*-1 to offer theatrical movies produced * separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays.
The executive said 0 Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris - Craft Industries' broadcasting unit, which *T*-1 owns five independent stations in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.
A Chris - Craft station manager said 0 there have been no formal talks.
"I think 0 it *EXP*-3's to Fox's advantage *PRO* to be associated *-1 with the Paramount - MCA venture," said *T*-4 Michael Conway, station manager of WTXF, the TVX station that *T*-2 is a Fox affiliate.
Mr. Conway said 0 the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount - MCA shows wouldn't be offered *-2 *T*-3 could be promoted *-1 on the programs produced * by Paramount - MCA.
Michael Fisher, general manager of KTXL, a Fox affiliate in Sacramento, Calif., said, "The real question is whether the Paramount - MCA offering is practical.
It isn't *?*....
Why would I consider *PRO*-2 giving up Fox, a proven commodity," for an unknown venture *T*-1?
Fox attracts a young audience with shows such as "Married...With Children," its most successful series.
Health Care Property Investors Inc. said 0 it acquired three long - term care facilities and one assisted - living facility in a *PRO* purchase - and - lease transaction valued * at $15 million *U*.
The real estate investment trust said that it leased the three Florida facilities to National Health Care Affiliates Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y.
Health Care Property holds an interest in 139 facilities in 30 states.
SANTA FE PACIFIC PIPELINE PARTNERS Limited Partnership, of Los Angeles, increased its quarterly cash dividend to 60 cents a unit *ICH*-1 from 55 cents, payable Nov. 14 to units of record Oct. 31.
The company is an independent refined - petroleum - products pipeline serving six Western states.
Short interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month, this time 4.2%, while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest.
The Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September.
Amex short interest climbed 3% to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares.
For the year - earlier month, the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares, *PRO* indicating a 13.5% year - to - year rise, while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares, a 48% leap.
Amex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December, with increases in each month since then except at mid-July.
Traders who *T*-1 sell short borrow stock and sell it, *PRO*-2 betting that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that *T*-2 haven't yet been purchased *-1 for return to lenders.
Although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought *-1 back.
Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused *-1 partly by arbitraging.
The figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
The level of negative sentiment measured * by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month's 3.38.
The ratio is the number of trading days, at the exchange's average trading volume, that *T*-1 would be required *-2 *PRO* to convert the total short interest position.
Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used *-1 *PRO* to hedge short positions.
Varity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares.
Varity has proposed *PRO*-1 to acquire K - H Corp., consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp., for $577.3 million *U* of cash and securities.
Chemical Waste Management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the New York exchange, up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238.
Bristol - Myers Squibb Co., the entity formed * from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol - Myers Co., logged the largest volume decline, 7,592,988 shares, to 12,017,724.
Short interest in International Business Machines Corp. plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier.
Also closely watched *-1 is *T*-2 Exxon Corp., where short interest slid to 4,469,167 shares from 5,088,774 *T*-3.
On a percentage basis, Germany Fund Inc. led the gainers, *PRO*-1 leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares.
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. led the percentage decliners, *PRO*-1 dropping to 59 shares from 183,467.
The Amex short interest volume leader again was Texas Air Corp., *PRO*-1 rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949.
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. posted the largest volume increase, 552,302 shares, to 2,157,656.
The company is under an investigation concerning procedures 0 *PRO* to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs *T*-1.
Bolar has denied any wrongdoing.
The largest volume drop--down 445,645 shares to 141,903--came in shares represented * by B.A.T Industries PLC's American depositary receipts.
The company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir James Goldsmith.
First Iberian Fund led the percentage increases, *PRO*-1 rising to 73,100 shares from 184.
Nelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis, to 1,000 shares from 255,923.
The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October *T*-1 or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September *T*-2.

THE SALES PITCH couldn't sound better.
First, there's the name: "asset - backed securities."
Better than all those offers *ICH*-2 0 you get *T*-1 *PRO* to buy securities backed * by nothing.
And there's more.
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest--and most secure--institutions.
Most earn high ratings from credit agencies.
Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues.
And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation's biggest institutional investors.
Ready *PRO* to jump?
Well, *PRO* think twice.
The concept may be simple: *PRO* Take a bunch of loans, tie them up in one neat package, and sell pieces of the package to investors.
But the simplicity may be misleading.
Skeptics say 0 the slightly higher returns aren't enough *PRO* to compensate for the extra risk.
They warn that asset - backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that *T*-1 support them--and those are hard 0 *PRO* to evaluate *T*-2.
Moreover, the securities were introduced *-1 only about 4 1/2 years ago; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession *T*-2.
"A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters," says *T*-1 Owen Carney, director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency.
"We don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn *T*-1."
Such concerns, however, haven't stopped asset - backed securities from *PRO*-1 becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products.
Since the spring of 1985, financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities.
They have sold issues backed * by car loans, boat loans and recreational - vehicle loans.
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used * *PRO* to buy vacation time - shares.
Last year, there was an issue of "death - backed bonds"--securities backed * by loans to life - insurance policyholders.
Some predict 0 there will be "Third World bonds," backed * by loans to Brazil, Argentina and other debt - ridden nations.
And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed * by credit - card receivables, sometimes known * as "plastic bonds."
"This is the heyday of debt," says *T*-1 James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter.
"Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems 0 nothing will be left *-1 *PRO*-2 unhocked."
The result is a $45 billion *U* market, according to Securities Data Co.
That includes more than $9.5 billion *U* issued through August of this year, up sharply from $6.5 billion *U* in the comparable 1988 period--and more than in all of 1987.
Most issues have been sold *-1 to professional money managers, pension funds, bank trust departments and other institutions.
But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in, and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset - backed market.
The entry fee is affordable: Issues typically are sold *-1 in minimum denominations of $1,000 *U*.
"We expect additional offerings" of asset - backed securities targeted * toward individual investors, says 0 *T*-1 Bill Addiss, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
The process typically begins when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit - card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust *T*-1.
The trust then issues securities--generally due in five years or less--that *T*-1 are underwritten *-2 by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered *-2 to investors.
Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings.
Enthusiasts say 0 the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers, while *PRO*-1 providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions.
Asset - backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds," says 0 *T*-1 Craig J. Goldberg, managing director and head of the asset - backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
But skeptics question whether asset - backed bonds offer sufficient rewards 0 *T*-1 to compensate for the extra risks.
*PRO* Consider a $500 million *U* offering of 9% securities issued * last spring and backed * by Citibank credit - card receivables.
The triple - A - rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four - year Treasury issues.
On a $10,000 *U* investment, that's a difference of only $50 *U* a year.
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who *T*-1 buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood *T*-2 depends on *PRO* outperforming the money manager across the street.
But for individuals who *T*-1 buy much smaller amounts and care less *ICH*-2 about relative performance than in *PRO* preserving what they have *T*-3, that margin is meaningless.
"If you're in the bond business *PRO*-1 playing the relative - performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis," says *T*-2 Mr. Grant.
"But if you're an individual investing money and trying *PRO* to get it back again, then that isn't of overwhelming importance."
Moreover, the interest on asset - backed securities is fully taxable, while interest on Treasury issues is tax - free at the state and local level.
That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset - backed issues for individuals in high - tax states, such as New York or California *T*-1.
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset - backed issues for individuals with tax - deferred accounts, such as retirement plans.
He points out that institutions buying asset - backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts.
Another concern is liquidity, or how easily a security can be converted *-1 into cash *T*-2.
The secondary, or resale, market for asset - backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues.
That could make it tricky for investors who *T*-1 need *-2 to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature.
That's particularly true, analysts say 0 *?*, for certain of the securities, such as those backed * by time - share loans.
"You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market," says *T*-1 Jonathan S. Paris, a vice president of European Investors Inc., a New York investment - management firm.
In addition, an investor who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded * on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings.
There aren't any such listings for asset - backed securities.
*PRO* Evaluating asset - backed securities poses another problem.
Investors, for instance, may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that *T*-1 originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities.
It isn't *?*.
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit - card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in *RNR*-1 or obligations of *RNR*-1 the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof."
In other words, if there's a problem, *PRO* don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue.
The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed *-1 by any government agency.
That means 0 investors have *-2 to focus on the quality of the debt that *T*-1 lies beneath the securities, as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings 0 the issue has received *T*-3.
That also isn't easy.
*PRO* Take the "credit enhancements," which *T*-1 typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond - insurance company.
The letter of credit typically is not offered *-1 by the bank selling the assets 0 *T*-2 to back the securities.
Nor does it cover the entire portfolio.
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue.
Still, they play a crucial role in *PRO*-1 winning top ratings for most asset - backed issues--which *T*-2 in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim *T*-3.
But skeptics ask why you should bother *PRO*-1 buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government - guaranteed paper *T*-2 *T*-3.
When you buy an asset - backed issue *T*-1, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties.
If a bank's credit rating was lowered *-1 because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset - backed issues that the bank supports *T*-2.
Underwriters insist 0 these issues are constructed *-1 *PRO*-2 to withstand extremely tough economic conditions.
But despite the credit enhancements, despite the high ratings, some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets.
At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs *T*-1, asset - backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able *PRO*-2 to repay loans in hard times.
At the very least, a recession would prompt investors *PRO*-2 to buy the highest - quality bonds 0 they can find *T*-1--that is, Treasurys.
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset - backed securities, as well as make it *EXP*-1 tougher *PRO* to unload the latter.
But it could be much worse.
Some analysts are especially wary of credit - card issues.
For one thing, credit - card loans are unsecured.
In addition, they fear that banks have been overeager *PRO*-2 to issue cards to the public--*PRO*-2 giving cards to too many big spenders who *T*-1 will default during a recession.
"A day of reckoning is coming where we think 0 the market will place a high premium on the highest - quality debt issues *T*-1, and therefore we think 0 the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds," says *T*-2 Craig Corcoran of Davis / Zweig Futures Inc., an investment advisory firm.
What about triple - A - rated asset - backed issues?
"Nope, we still say *PRO*-1 to stick with Treasurys," Mr. Corcoran replies *T*-2.
Ratings, he notes 0 *?*, "are subject to change."
All this makes asset - backed securities seem *-1 too risky for many people.
And it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., of what he calls *T*-1 "*PRO*-2 DeVoe's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1:
"More money *ICH*-1 has been lost *-2 *PRO* reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations, scams and frauds of all time."
Mr. Herman is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.

I was amused *PRO*-2 to read your recent news stories on the banking industry's reserve additions and concomitant threats *PRO* to cease *PRO*-1 making new loans to less - developed countries.
If the whole story were told *-1, it would read something like this:
-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and "Use of Proceeds" confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made *-1 *T*-2.
-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings (and management bonuses); the price, a sea of bad loans.
-- For the past several years, the banks, *PRO*-1 lacking a private navy 0 *T*-2 to enforce their interests, have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury *PRO*-3 to underwrite their bad LDC credits.
-- The Treasury wisely has refused, but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made *-1 available for a price: either debt reduction or debt - service reduction or new loans (the Brady Plan).
-- The banks will threaten *PRO*-1 not to make further loans, but in truth, *PRO*-2 lacking the capital 0 *PRO* to write off their mistakes or to build a navy *T*-3, they have no alternative but *PRO* to go along.

The prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the Soviet Union is keeping up its dizzying October buying binge of U.S. corn.
Those rumors were confirmed *-1 after the end of trading yesterday when the U.S. Agriculture Department announced that the Soviets had bought 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. corn, *PRO* bringing their U.S. corn purchases confirmed * so far this month to about five million metric tons *T*-2.
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for December delivery jumped 5.75 cents a bushel *PRO*-1 to settle at $2.44 *U* a bushel.
The Soviet purchases are close to *PRO*-1 exceeding what some analysts had expected the Soviet Union to buy *T*-2 this fall, the season in which it usually buys much of the corn 0 it imports *T*-4 from the U.S. *T*-3.
That pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the Soviet Union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons.
One sign that more Soviet purchases are possible is that U.S. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts.
That sometimes signals that they are laying plans *PRO* to export corn.
By some estimates, several grain companies combined * bought contracts for the possession of roughly one million metric tons of corn.
By *PRO*-1 buying futures contracts, these companies attempt *PRO*-1 to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated *-3 *PRO*-4 to deliver *T*-2.
Rumors of Soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts.
Among other things, the Agriculture Department is widely thought *-1 to be mulling whether *PRO*-2 to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the Soviet Union.
On top of all this, corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the Midwest harvest was disrupted *-1 by a freakishly early snow storm that *T*-2 dumped several inches in parts of Indiana and Ohio.
The harvest delays, however, are expected *-1 to be temporary.
Balmy temperatures are forecast *-1 for next week, said 0 *T*-2 Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp., Chicago.
Many farmers used the jump in prices *PRO*-1 to sell their recently harvested crop to grain elevator companies.
The heavy selling by farmers helped *PRO*-1 to damp the price rally.
Wheat futures prices rose slightly.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
PRECIOUS METALS:
Futures prices declined.
A number of developments were negatively interpreted *-1 by traders.
December delivery gold fell $1.80 *U* an ounce to $370.60 *U*.
December silver eased 2.7 cents an ounce to $5.133 *U*.
January platinum was down $3.60 *U* an ounce at $491.10 *U*.
One price - depressing development was the lower - than - *PRO* expected *-2 increase of only 0.2% in the consumer price index for September, an analyst said 0 *T*-1.
He noted that the "core inflation rate," which *T*-1 excludes food and energy, was also low at 0.2%.
Other news that *T*-1 weighed on the market: Initial unemployment claims rose by 62,000 last week; American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will reduce its managerial staff by 15,000 through attrition; the oil market turned weaker; there wasn't any investor demand for bullion; and the dollar strengthened during the day, *PRO* putting pressure on gold.
Also, the analyst said 0 *?*, economic circumstances are such that both South Africa and the Soviet Union, the principal gold and platinum producers, are being forced *-2 *PRO*-4 to continue *-3 selling the metals.
Both are in great need of foreign exchange, and South Africa is also under pressure *PRO* to meet foreign loan commitments, he said 0 *T*-1.
"*PRO* Putting it all together, we have a negative scenario that *T*-1 doesn't look like it will improve overnight," he said *T*-2.
COPPER:
Futures prices recovered in quiet trading.
The December contract rose 1.50 cents a pound to $1.2795 *U*.
That contract fell a total of 5.75 cents during the first three days of this week, mostly in reaction to last Friday's stock market plunge, which *T*-1 prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the U.S. economy and thus reduced demand for copper, a leading industrial metal.
In recent days, however, there has been increased purchasing of copper in London, an analyst said 0 *T*-1.
Some of this buying was by Japan, which *T*-1 has had its supplies sharply reduced *-3 by long production stoppages at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, and the Cananea mine in Mexico, which *T*-2 are major shippers to Japan.
The increasing likelihood that Cananea and Highland Valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing, but even if any of these mines begin *-1 operating soon, their output won't be significant until at least the end of the year, analysts note 0 *T*-2.
So, one analyst said, even though the long - term production problems may be easing, there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months, when inventories will remain relatively low *T*-1.
ENERGY:
Crude oil prices ended mixed.
West Texas Intermediate for November delivery fell 14 cents a barrel to $20.42 *U*.
But so - called outer month contracts finished higher.
For instance, December contracts for WTI rose 17 cents to $20.42 *U*.
Most energy futures opened lower, following Wednesday's market downturn.
But a flurry of late trading yesterday beefed up prices.
Heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well.
NOW YOU SEE IT, now you don't *?*.
The recession, that is *T*-1.
The economy's stutter steps leave investors *PRO*-1 wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up.
So often *ICH*-1 are government statistics revised that they seem *-2 to resemble a spinning weather vane.
For the past seven years, investors have had the wind at their backs, in the form of a generally growing economy.
Some may have forgotten *RNR*-2--and some younger ones may never have experienced *RNR*-2--what it *EXP*-3's like *T*-1 *PRO* to invest during a recession.
Different tactics are called for *-1, as *PRO* losing money becomes easier and *PRO* making money becomes tougher.
For those investors who *T*-3 believe--or fear--that 1990 will be a recession year, many economists and money managers agree on steps that *T*-4 can be taken *-1 *PRO* to lower the risks in a portfolio.
In a nutshell, pros advise investors who *T*-1 expect a slowdown *PRO*-2 to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in "defensive" industries.
A heavy dose of cash is prescribed *-1, along with a heavier - than - usual allotment to bonds--preferably government bonds.
It *EXP*-2's tempting *PRO* to think 0 these defensive steps can be delayed *-1 until a recession is clearly at hand.
But that may not be possible, because recessions often take investors by surprise.
"They always seem *-1 to come a bit later than you expect.
When they do hit *T*-1, they hit fast," says *T*-2 David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw - Hill Inc.
Though he himself doesn't expect a recession soon, Mr. Wyss advises people who *T*-1 do *?* that "the best thing 0 *PRO* to be in *T*-2 is long that is, 20 - year to 30 - year Treasury bonds."
The reason is simple, Mr. Wyss says 0 *T*-1: "Interest rates almost always decline during recession."
As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds.
They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do *?*.
That effect holds *PRO*-1 true for both short - term and long - term bonds.
But short - term bonds can't rise too much, because everyone knows 0 they will be redeemed *-1 at a preset price fairly soon.
Long - term bonds, with many years left before maturity, swing more widely in price.
But not just any bonds will do.
Corporate bonds "are usually not a good bet in a recession," Mr. Wyss says *T*-1.
As times get tougher, investors fret about whether companies will have enough money 0 *T*-1 to pay their debts.
This hurts the price of corporate bonds.
Also, he notes 0 *?*, "most corporate bonds are callable."
That means that a corporation, after a specified amount of time has passed, can buy back its bonds by *PRO*-1 paying investors the face value (plus, in some cases, a sweetener).
When interest rates have dropped *T*-1, it *EXP*-2 makes sense for corporations to do just that; they then save on interest costs.
But the investors are left *-1 *PRO*-4 stranded *-5 with money 0 *PRO* to reinvest *T*-2 at a time when interest rates are puny *T*-3.
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions, junk bonds are likely *-1 to be the worst of all.
It *EXP*-2's an "absolute necessity" *PRO* to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing *T*-3, says 0 *T*-1 Avner Arbel, professor of finance at Cornell University.
"Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside, and this could be a disaster."
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession, but not as safe as bonds issued * by the federal government.
During an economic slump, local tax revenues often go down, *PRO* raising the risks associated * with at least some municipals.
And, like corporates, many municipal bonds are callable.
But a few experts, *PRO*-1 going against the consensus, don't think 0 bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing.
One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach, director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co., a brokerage house in Houston, who *T*-1 thinks that "we're either in a recession or about *PRO*-2 to go into one."
What's more, he thinks 0 this could be a nastier recession than usual: "Once the downturn comes, it's going *-1 to be very hard 0 *PRO* to reverse *T*-2."
Investors, he advises 0 *?*, "should be cautious," *PRO*-2 holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds.
Because he sees a "5% to 6% *U* base rate of inflation in the economy," he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon.
Instead, Mr. Beach says 0 *?*, investors "probably should be carrying a very high level of cash," by which he means such so - called cash equivalents as money - market funds and Treasury bills *T*-2.
Greg Confair, president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown, Pa., also recommends that investors go heavily for cash.
He isn't sure 0 a recession is coming, but says 0 the other likely alternative--reignited inflation--is just as bad.
"This late in an expansion," the economy tends *-1 to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession, Mr. Confair says 0 *T*-2.
The Federal Reserve Board's plan for a "soft landing," he says 0 *?*, requires the Fed *PRO*-1 to navigate "an ever - narrowing corridor."
A soft landing isn't something that *T*-2 can be achieved *-1 once and for all, Mr. Confair adds 0 *T*-3.
It has *-2 to be engineered *-1 over and over again, month after month.
He believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles "*PRO* juggling a double - bladed ax and a buzz saw."
And, in a sense, that's the kind of task 0 individuals face *T*-1 in *PRO*-2 deciding what *PRO* to do *T*-3 about stocks--the mainstay of most serious investors' portfolios.
It comes down to a question of whether *PRO* to try *PRO*-1 to "time" the market.
For people who *T*-1 can ride out market waves through good times and bad, stocks have been rewarding long - term investments.
Most studies show that *PRO* buy - and - hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9% to 10% *U*, including both dividends and price appreciation.
That's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid *T*-1.
Moreover, because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming *T*-1, some analysts think 0 investors shouldn't even worry too much about timing.
"*PRO* Trying *PRO*-1 to time the economy is a mistake," says *T*-2 David Katz, chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York.
Mr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years.
Investors who *T*-1 listened, and lightened up on stocks, "have just hurt themselves," he says 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Katz adds that people who *T*-1 jump in *RNR*-2 and out of *RNR*-2 the stock market need *-3 to be right about 70% of the time *PRO*-3 to beat a *PRO* buy - and - hold strategy.
Frequent trading runs up high commission costs.
And the in - and - outer might miss the sudden spurts that *T*-1 account for much of the stock market's gains over time.
Still, few investors are able *PRO*-2 to sit tight when they are convinced 0 a recession is coming *T*-3.
After all, in all five recessions since 1960, stocks declined.
According to Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis, Fla., the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21%, and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started.
By the time 0 a recession is "official" *T*-1 (two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product), much of the damage to stocks has already been done *-2 - and, in the typical case, the recession is already half over.
About six months before a recession ends, stocks typically begin *-1 to rise again, as investors anticipate a recovery.
The average recession lasts about a year.
Unfortunately, though, recessions vary enough *ICH*-1 in length so that the average can't reliably be used *-2 *PRO* to guide investors in *PRO* timing stock sales or purchases.
But whatever their advice about timing, none of these experts recommend *PRO* jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession.
For the portion of an investor's portfolio that *T*-1 stays in stocks, professionals have a number of suggestions.
Mr. Katz advocates issues with low price - earnings ratios--that is, low prices in relation to the company's earnings per share.
"Low P - E" stocks, he says 0 *?*, vastly outperform others "during a recession or bear market."
In good times, he says 0 *?*, they lag a bit, but overall they provide superior performance.
Prof. Arbel urges investors *PRO*-1 to discard stocks in small companies.
Small - company shares typically fall more than big - company stocks in a recession, he says 0 *T*-1.
And in any case, he argues 0 *?*, stocks of small companies are "almost as overpriced as they were *?* Sept. 30, 1987, just before the crash."
For example, Mr. Arbel says 0 *?*, stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow.
(Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health.)
That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that *T*-1 prevailed before the 1987 stock - market crash, Mr. Arbel says 0 *T*-2.
And it's way above the ratio (7.5 times cash flow) that bigger companies are selling for *T*-1.
Another major trick in *PRO* making a portfolio recession - resistant is choosing stocks in "defensive" industries.
Food, tobacco, drugs and utilities are the classic examples.
Recession or not, people still eat, smoke, and take medicine when they're sick *T*-1.
George Putnam III, editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston, offers one final tip for recession - wary investors.
"*PRO* Keep some money *PRO*-2 available for opportunities," he says *T*-1.
"If the recession does hit, there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem *-2 the blackest *T*-1."
Mr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others.
The following shows the number of times 0 these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 - Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions *T*-1.
For retailers, Christmas, not Halloween, promises *PRO*-1 to be this year's spookiest season.
Many retailers fear 0 a price war will erupt if cash - strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags *PRO*-1 to spur sales.
Concerns about the stock market, doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators.
"Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer," asserts *T*-1 Norman Abramson, president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc., an off - price chain.
Even if there isn't any widespread discounting, the outlook for industry profits isn't good.
Management Horizons forecasts a 1.4% profit decline for non-auto retailers this year, after annual drops that *T*-1 averaged 4.5% in 1988 and 1987.
"For the last two and a half years, retailing has been in a mild recession," says *T*-1 Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the Columbus, Ohio, consulting firm.
This year, many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil: Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code; B.A.T Industries PLC's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's chains are on the auction block; Campeau's Bloomingdale's is also on the block.
Industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance.
Stores in a state of confusion are likely *-2 to fare poorly, and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc., which *T*-1 should do well.
"There are going *-2 to be very clear winners and very clear losers," says *T*-1 Cynthia Turk, a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant.
Says *ICH*-1 Mr. Steidtmann: "I'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas."
Economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5% to 6% from year - ago figures.
But Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25% to 30% *U*.
Troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8%, he believes 0 *?*, as managers distracted * by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy.
Thin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected *-1 to hurt sales.
Catalog companies are likely *-1 to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year, particularly in December.
More than 200 catalog outfits are promoting a low - cost Federal Express service that *T*-1 guarantees pre-Christmas delivery of orders made * by a certain date.
"Traditionally, consumers were concerned *-1 about *PRO*-1 ordering after the first of December because they didn't believe 0 they would get it by Christmas," says *T*-3 Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast Inc., which *T*-2 sells wine cellars and accessories through the mail.
*PRO* Using Federal Express delivery last year, Mr. Strum says 0 *?*, "December was our biggest month."
Even Sears, Roebuck & Co. is getting into the act, *PRO*-1 offering for the first time *PRO*-2 to have Federal Express deliver toys ordered * by Dec. 20 from its Wish Book catalog.
K mart Corp. Chairman Joseph E. Antonini summed up his outlook for the Christmas season as "not troublesome."
He's not predicting a blockbuster, but he is "more optimistic than three months ago" because employment remains strong and inflation low.
Other retailers are also preparing for a ho - hum holiday.
Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest 3% to 5% *U* over last year's totals, both for his company and the industry in general.
"I'm not looking for a runaway Christmas at all," he says *T*-1.
"It isn't a real boom holiday season in our eyes," says *?* Woolworth Corp. Chairman Harold E. Sells, "but it isn't going *-2 to be a bust either."
Mr. Sells expects fourth - quarter sales at his company--which *T*-1 besides Woolworth stores includes Kinney and Foot Locker shoe stores and other specialty chains--to rise "pretty much in line" with its year - to - date increases of between 8% and 9% *U*.
The estimate includes the results of new stores.
A consumer poll conducted * in early September by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market researcher based * in Chicago, also suggests a modest holiday.
Of the 450 survey respondents, 35% *T*-1 said 0 they expect *PRO*-3 to spend less *ICH*-2 *PRO* buying Christmas gifts this year than last year, while 28% said 0 they expect *PRO*-4 to spend more and 37% said 0 their gift budget would stay the same.
The results are almost identical to Shapiro's September 1988 numbers.
Retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar.
Christmas falls on a Monday, *PRO* creating a big last - minute weekend opportunity for stores.
Most will stay open late Saturday night and open their doors again Sunday.
But many consumers probably will use the extra time *PRO*-1 to put off some purchasing until the last minute.
"What you'll hear *T*-1 as we get into December is that sales are sluggish," predicts *T*-2 Woolworth's Mr. Sells.
"The week ending the 24th is going *-1 to save the entire month for everyone.
What if it happened to us?
In the wake of the earthquake in California and the devastation of Hurricane Hugo, many companies in disaster - prone areas are pondering the question of preparedness.
Some, particularly in West Coast earthquake zones, are dusting off their evacuation plans, *PRO*-1 checking food stocks and reminding employees of what *PRO* to do *T*-2 if emergency strikes.
Others say 0 they feel confident that steps 0 they've already taken *T*-1 would see them through a disaster.
Preparedness involves more than flashlights and fire alarms these days.
Some big companies have teams of in - house experts focusing on safety and business resumption.
Many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up contingency offices in safe regions, *PRO*-1 hoping 0 they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly.
That means *PRO* making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm's way.
Some businesses--like Disneyland--claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis, they would be able *PRO*-1 to feed *RNR*-2 and care for *RNR*-2 their people for as long as five days.
"Self - sufficiency has *-2 to be the cornerstone of your plan," says *T*-1 Stephanie Masaki - Schatz, manager of corporate emergency planning at Atlantic Richfield Co. in Los Angeles.
"If you don't save your critical people, you won't be able *PRO*-1 to bring up your vital business functions."
Although ARCO's head office, more than 300 miles from the epicenter, wasn't affected *-1 by this week's tremors, Ms. Masaki - Schatz used the occasion *PRO*-2 to distribute a three - page memo of "Earthquake Tips" to 1,200 ARCO employees.
"You need *-1 to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone's attention *T*-2," she says *T*-3.
"It was a good reminder that we all need *-1 to prepare prior to an event."
The ARCO memo urges employees *PRO*-2 to keep certain supplies *ICH*-1 at work, such as solid shoes and "heavy gloves 0 *PRO* to clear debris *T*-3."
It also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that *T*-2 could be used *-1 for emergency care or shelter.
Among the suggestions: Pantyhose and men's ties could be used *-1 for slings, while removable wooden shelves might aid in "*PRO* breaking through office walls."
ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that *T*-2 would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted *-1.
Two months ago the company set up a toll - free number, based * outside California, 0 *T*-1 to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster *T*-2.
The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business *T*-1 are busier at certain times of the year.
This way, *PRO* depending on when a quake might strike *T*-4, priorities can be assigned *-1 to departments that *T*-3 should be brought *-2 back on line first.
At Hewlett - Packard Co., the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures.
"We were talking about *PRO*-2 scheduling a practice drill for November," says *T*-1 Joan Tharp, a spokeswoman.
"Then we had a real one in the afternoon."
The Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker scrambled *PRO*-1 to set up a special phone line 0 *T*-2 to tell manufacturing and support staff *PRO*-3 to stay home Wednesday.
Sales and service employees were asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to report to work *PRO*-5 to help Bay area clients who *T*-1 called with computer problems.
Hewlett - Packard also called in its systems experts *PRO*-1 to restore its own computer operations.
"That means 0 we can accept orders" and begin *-2 getting back to normal, says 0 *T*-1 Ms. Tharp.
*PRO* Prompted *-1 by an earlier California earthquake, as well as a fire in a Los Angeles office tower, Great Western Bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $75,000 *U* *PRO*-2 equipping a trailer with communications gear *PRO*-3 to serve as an emergency headquarters.
Although officials of the savings and loan, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp., used some of their new plans and equipment during this week's quake, they still lost touch for more than 24 hours with 15 branches in the affected areas, *PRO*-3 not knowing if employees were injured *-1 or vaults were broken *-2 *PRO*-4 open.
"Some people flat out didn't know what *PRO* to do *T*-1," says *T*-2 Robert G. Lee, vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at Great Western.
As it turned out, bank employees weren't hurt *-1 and the vaults withstood the jolts.
Still, says *ICH*-2 Mr. Lee: "We need *-3 to educate people that they need *-4 to get to a phone somehow, some way, *PRO*-5 to let someone know what their status is *T*-1."
Some companies are confident that they're prepared.
Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food, oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16 - story headquarters.
The company also maintains rechargeable flashlights in offices and changes its standby supply of drinking water every three months.
"We feel 0 we are doing everything 0 we can *?* *T*-2," an Occidental spokesman says *T*-1.
Walt Disney Co.'s Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., stocks rescue equipment, medical supplies, and enough food and water 0 *T*-1 to feed at least 10,000 visitors for as long as five days in the event that a calamity isolates the theme park.
The park also has emergency centers where specially trained employees would go *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to coordinate evacuation and rescue plans *PRO*-3 using walkie - talkies, cellular phones, and a public - address system.
The centers are complete with maps detailing utility lines beneath rides and "safe havens" where people can be assembled *-1 away from major structures *T*-2.
Vista Chemical Co., with three chemical plants in and near Lake Charles, La., "prepares for every hurricane that *T*-1 enters the Gulf of Mexico," says 0 *T*-2 Keith L. Fogg, a company safety director.
Hurricane Hugo, an Atlantic storm, didn't affect Vista.
But two other major storms have threatened operations so far this year, most recently Hurricane Jerry this week.
Because hurricanes can change course rapidly, the company sends employees home and shuts down operations in stages--the closer a storm gets *?*, the more complete the shutdown.
The company doesn't wait until the final hours *PRO*-1 to get ready for hurricanes.
"There are just tons of things that *T*-2 have *-4 to be considered *-1," Mr. Fogg says *T*-3.
"Empty tank cars will float away on you if you get a big tidal surge."
Still, Vista officials realize 0 they're relatively fortunate.
"With a hurricane you know 0 it's coming.
You have time 0 *PRO* to put precautionary mechanisms in place *T*-1," notes *T*-2 a Vista spokeswoman.
"A situation like San Francisco is so frightening because there's no warning.
*PRO*-1 Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors, *PRO*-2 fighting the urge *PRO* to spend more, we're reminded *-1 of those late - night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says, "*PRO* Stop me before I kill again *T*-3."
The Members know 0 they're doing wrong, but they need help *PRO*-1 to restrain their darker compulsions.
Arkansas Democrat David Pryor spilled his guts on the Senate floor the other day after he'd joined the Finance Committee's early - morning pork - barrel revels: "I must tell you ...
I come to the floor tonight as one who *T*-1 ended up with a busload of extraneous matter.
It was nothing more *RNR*-1 or nothing less *RNR*-1 than a feeding frenzy."
He was turning himself in.
"Frankly, as I was walking back *PRO*-2 to get in my car, I heard many, many people...opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished *T*-1 in *PRO*-3 getting our little deal in the tax bill and winking at this person for *PRO*-4 slipping this in," he said *T*-5.
"As I was driving home, I did not feel very good about myself."
We can applaud Mr. Pryor's moment of epiphany, even as we understand that he and his confreres need restraint lest they kill again.
A good place 0 *PRO* to start the rehabilitation *T*-1 is a "legislative line - item veto" bill now being offered * by Indiana Senator Dan Coats.
The Coats bill, which *T*-1 already has 32 Senate co-sponsors, isn't a pure line - item veto because it would apply only to spending bills.
Instead it's a form of "enhanced rescission," giving a President a chance *PRO* to rescind, or strike, specific spending items that *T*-1 just go too far.
Under the proposal, a President would have a chance *ICH*-1 twice each year *PRO* to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill--once when he proposes his budget *T*-2 and again after Congress disposes.
Congress would have 20 days 0 *PRO* to reject the package with a 50% majority *T*-1, but then a President could veto that rejection.
Congress would then need the usual two - thirds majority 0 *T*-1 to override any veto.
The proposal would restore some discipline erased * from the budget process by the 1974 Budget "Reform" Act.
Before 1974, a President could "impound *RNR*-2," or refuse *PRO*-1 to spend *RNR*-2, funds appropriated * by Congress.
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power, but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away.
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind.
This is like *PRO* asking foxes *PRO*-2 to feel remorse about chickens, and naturally rescissions are almost never approved *-1.
In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved *-1 by Congress.
Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts.
The Members could still try *PRO*-1 to serve their constituents with special - interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now.
Mr. Coats plans *PRO*-1 to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill 0 *T*-2 to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month.
President Bush has endorsed the idea, and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted *PRO*-1 to support enhanced rescission authority in the past.
We're told *-2 0 Senator Pryor isn't yet a co-sponsor, but if he and his colleagues are serious about *PRO*-1 kicking their compulsions, they'll sign up.
Bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt.
But while the overall market improved, the new - issue junk - bond market continued *-1 to count casualties, even as junk - bond prices rose.
Yesterday, Prudential - Bache Securities Inc. said 0 it postponed a $220 million *U* senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp.
And Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled *PRO*-3 to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $475 million *U* debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that *T*-2 was still being negotiated *-1 late last night.
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so - called good junk - bond offerings on the new - issue calendar.
Some analysts said 0 the restructuring of the railroad concern's issue shows how tough it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered *PRO* to be a relatively good credit risk.
Since last week's junk - bond market debacle, many new issues of high - yield, high - risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back *-1, delayed *-1 or dropped *-1.
On Wednesday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had *-1 to slash the size of Continental Airlines' junk - bond offering to $71 million *U* from $150 million *U*.
Salomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co.'s $1.16 billion *U* junk - bond offering while it restructures the transaction.
Last week, the Grand Union offering was sweetened *-2 *PRO*-3 to include warrants that *T*-1 allow bondholders to acquire common stock.
Prudential - Bache said 0 the York issue was delayed *-1 because of market conditions.
"Everything is going through firehoops right now, and {Chicago & North Western} is no exception," said *T*-1 Mariel Clemensen, vice president, high - yield research, at Citicorp.
Portfolio managers say 0 sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required *-1 *PRO* to sell junk - bond deals.
Dan Baldwin, managing director of high - yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management, said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured *-1 in part because "several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package.
If you're going *-1 to take the risk in this market, you want something extra."
Mr. Baldwin likes the offering.
But several mutual - fund managers, *PRO*-3 nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk - bond portfolios and shy about *PRO* buying new issues, said 0 they're staying away from any junk security that *T*-2 isn't considered *-1 first rate for its class.
While they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good, they don't view it as the best.
*PRO*-2 To lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds, portfolio managers said 0 Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by *PRO*-2 offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10% equity kicker *T*-1.
The bonds are expected *-1 to have a 14 1/2% coupon rate.
The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of CNW Corp., Chicago & North Western's parent company.
Donaldson Lufkin declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the restructuring.
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated * with the investment bank Blackstone Group, which *T*-1 would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5% each.
That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60% stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15%.
Despite the problems with new issues, high - yield bonds showed gains in the secondary, or resell, market.
Junk bonds ended about one - half point higher with so - called high - quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point.
In the Treasury market, the benchmark 30 - year bond rose seven - eighths point, or $8.75 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
The gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows.
That raised hopes that interest rates will continue *-1 to move lower.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2% last month, slightly lower than some economists had expected.
But there were also rumors *ICH*-1 yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long - term bonds while *PRO*-2 selling shorter - term Treasurys.
Short - term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed, with two - year notes posting slight declines while three - year notes were slightly higher.
Yesterday, the Fed executed four - day matched sales, a technical trading operation designed *PRO* to drain reserves from the banking system.
The move was interpreted *-1 by some economists as a sign that the Fed doesn't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3/4% at which it has been hovering around *T*-2 during the past week.
The closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other *T*-1 on overnight loans.
It is considered *-1 an early signal of Fed credit policy changes.
"The fact that they did four - day matched sales means 0 they are not in a mood 0 *PRO* to ease aggressively *T*-1.
They are telling us that {8 3/4%} is as low as they want *PRO*-1 to see the fed funds rate," said *T*-2 Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC.
Treasury Securities
The benchmark 30 - year bond was quoted *-1 late at a price of 101 25/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.955%, compared with 100 29/32 *PRO* to yield 8.032% Wednesday.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 late at 100 9/32 *PRO* to yield 7.937%, compared with 99 26/32 *PRO* to yield 8.007%.
Short - term rates rose yesterday.
The discount rate on three - month Treasury bills rose to 7.56% from 7.51% Wednesday, while the rate on six - month bills rose to 7.57% from 7.53%.
Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $9.75 billion *U* of 52 - week bills yesterday.
The average yield on the bills was 7.35%, down from 7.61% at the previous 52 - week bill auction Sept. 21.
Yesterday's yield was the lowest since 7.22% on July 27.
Here are *T*-1 details of the auction:
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value.
Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360 - day year, while the coupon - equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365 - day year.
Corporate Issues
Junk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new - issue market for high - yield securities.
Dealers said 0 junk bond issues on average were up by 1/4 to 1/2 point with so - called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one - point gains.
Petrolane Gas Service's 13 1/4% debentures traded at 102, after *PRO*-1 trading around par earlier this week, and RJR's 13 1/2% subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5/8 after *PRO*-2 trading at below par earlier this week.
Investment - grade bonds were unchanged.
Municipals
Activity was brisk in the high - grade general obligation market, as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector.
Traders estimated that more than $140 million *U* of high - grade bonds was put *-1 up for sale via bid - wanted lists circulated * by a handful of major brokers.
There was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank's portfolios.
According to market participants, the bonds were met *-1 with decent bids, but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10 - year and under * maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield.
Away from the general obligation sector, activity was modest.
Long dollar bonds were flat to up 3/8 point.
New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 3/8 at 98 3/8 bid *PRO*-1 to yield about 7.32%, down 0.03 percentage point.
The debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached * after Tuesday's massive earthquake, although traders said 0 market participants remained cautious.
California expects *PRO*-1 to rely on federal emergency funds and its $1.06 billion *U* in general fund reserves *PRO*-2 to meet the estimated $500 million to $1 billion *U* in damages resulting from the quake, according to a state official.
It *EXP*-2's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve *T*-3, said 0 *T*-4 Cindy Katz, assistant director of California's department of finance, although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose isn't anticipated *-1.
Meanwhile, new issuance was slow.
The largest sale in the competitive arena was a $55.7 million *U* issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority.
A balance of $25.8 million *U* remained in late order - taking, according to the lead manager.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities generally ended 6/32 to 9/32 point higher, but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts.
Premium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13% and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan *ICH*-1 being considered * by Congress *PRO* to speed the refinancing of government - subsidized mortgages.
Ginnie Mae 13% securities were down about 1/4 at 109 30/32.
If the refinancing plan clears Congress, there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities, *PRO* hurting any investor paying much above par for them.
In the current - coupon sector, a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long - dated issues over short - dated securities hurt major coupons because it *EXP*-1 will become more difficult *PRO* to structure new derivative securities offerings.
Ginnie Mae 9% securities ended at 98 6/32, up 9/32, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% securities were at 97 10/32, up 6/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.42% to a 12 - year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48.
While Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve, underwriters continued *-1 to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured * when the yield curve was more favorable *T*-2.
Two new Remics totaling $900 million *U* were announced *-1 by Freddie Mac yesterday.
Foreign Bonds
British government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 was down 2/32 at 111 29/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.09%, while the 11 3/4% notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 12.94%.
In Japan, the bellwether No. 111 4.6% bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72, *PRO*-1 to yield 5.32%, and in West Germany, the 7% benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 *PRO*-2 to yield 7.02%.
Switzerland's wholesale price index increased 0.3% in September from August, and was up 3.9% from a year ago, *PRO* marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4% on a year - to - year basis *T*-1, the government reported 0 *T*-2.
The government attributed the 0.3% month - to - month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices.
In August, the index was up 0.2% from the previous month, and was up 4.5% on a year - to - year basis.
The wholesale price index, *PRO* based * on 1963 as 100, was 180.9 in September.
Banc One Corp. said 0 it agreed in principle *PRO*-1 to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc., Toledo, Ohio, following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp., Cleveland.
The five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $88 million *U*, Banc One said 0 *T*-1.
The purchase price will be established *-1 after Banc One has an opportunity *PRO* to study the quality of the assets, Banc One said 0 *T*-2.
Society Corp. already has branches in the area, and *PRO* selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society, according to industry sources.
The merger is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to take place in the 1990 first quarter.
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. lost its second recent arbitration case involving a former bond - trading executive.
A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered Dean Witter *PRO*-1 to pay $404,294 *U* in back bonuses to William Kelly, the company's former head of high - yield, high - risk junk - bond trading and sales.
It also awarded $196,785 *U* in back bonuses to former trader Michael Newcomb and $69,105 *U* in fees to the two men's attorneys.
The sums awarded * to Messrs. Kelly and Newcomb represent bonuses 0 the two men said 0 they deserved *T*-3 from the first half of 1988, but which *T*-2 weren't paid *-1 because of a dispute over an incentive contract.
Jeffrey L. Liddle, the two men's attorney at Liddle, O'Connor, Finkelstein & Robinson, said 0 Mr. Kelly began *-1 working at Dean Witter in 1987.
Mr. Kelly built the company's high - yield bond group, which *T*-1 has been a minor player in the junk - bond arena.
Dean Witter lost a separate case involving a former bond executive earlier this year; in August it paid $666,666 *U* in back pay and a bonus to a former corporate - bond trading chief, Harold Bachman.
That award ended a dispute between Dean Witter and Mr. Bachman over who *T*-1 was responsible for certain bond - trading losses around the time of the 1987 stock - market crash.
A spokesman for Dean Witter, a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
The earthquake that *T*-1 hit the San Francisco Bay area isn't likely *-2 to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings, officials at the two major rating agencies said 0 *T*-3.
Standard & Poor's Corp. is reviewing debt issued * by 12 California counties, and "there are potential isolated problems," said 0 *T*-1 Hyman Grossman, a managing director.
The agency is preparing a report, 0 *T*-2 to be issued *-1 today, on the earthquake's impact on the property - and casualty - insurance industry.
The only securities 0 *T*-1 so far to be singled out *-2 are those issued * by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it is reviewing, with an eye toward a possible downgrade, the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds, long - term deposits and the preferred - stock rating of its parent company, Bay View Capital Corp.
As for property and casualty insurers, Moody's said 0 "preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers' financial condition," but it "raises concerns about potentially substantial risks" longer - term.
"Losses from the earthquake are expected *-1 to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo," according to Moody's.
The government will try *PRO*-1 to sell all the real estate managed * by the Federal Asset Disposition Association in one fell swoop, said 0 *T*-2 William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The FADA real - estate package, with an asking price of $428 million *U*, is comprised *-1 of 150 properties in Texas, California, Colorado, Arizona and Florida.
It includes apartments, shopping centers, office buildings and undeveloped land.
Mr. Seidman is chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., established * 0 *T*-1 to sell or merge the nation's hundreds of insolvent savings - and - loan associations.
The RTC, created * by this year's S&L bailout legislation, is trying *PRO*-1 to sell FADA's network of offices separately.
FADA, which *T*-4 holds problem assets of thrifts that *T*-5 were closed *-2 before the bailout legislation was enacted *-3, is being liquidated *-1.
The properties held * by FADA won't be sold *-1 piecemeal, Mr. Seidman said 0 *T*-2 in a speech before Southern Methodist University Business School in Dallas.
"You need *-1 to buy the entire lot," Mr. Seidman said *?*, "so *PRO* get out your checkbooks.
Just because Stamford, Conn., High School did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown *-1 in the trash *T*-2 doesn't mean 0 the city no longer owns the work of art, a federal judge ruled 0 *T*-3.
The mural, now valued * at $1.3 million *U* according to appraisers, was tossed *-1 in a trash heap in 1971 by workers who *T*-2 were renovating the building.
The 100 - foot - long mural, painted * by James Daugherty in 1934, was commissioned *-1 by the federal Works Project Administration.
After the discarded mural was found *-1 outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate, it eventually was turned *-2 over to Hiram Hoelzer, a professional art restorer.
Throughout the 1970s, Stamford school and city officials made no effort *PRO* to locate the mural.
Apparently the officials didn't even know 0 the mural was missing until 1980, when a researcher found that the painting was in Mr. Hoelzer's studio and questioned school officials about it *T*-1.
In 1986, Stamford officials thanked Mr. Hoelzer for *PRO*-1 taking care of the mural--and demanded 0 he return it as soon as possible.
Mr. Hoelzer, however, sued Stamford, *PRO*-1 claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long *PRO*-2 to reclaim it.
But Judge Louis L. Stanton of federal court in Manhattan ruled that the city couldn't be faulted *-1 for *PRO*-2 waiting too long because it didn't realize until 1986 that its ownership of the painting was in dispute.
The judge also ruled that the painting wasn't abandoned *-2 because officials didn't intend for it to be thrown away *-1 and were unaware that the workmen had discarded it.
Mr. Hoelzer didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge's decision.
The judge ordered that a hearing be held *-1 Nov. 17 *PRO* to determine how much the city should pay Mr. Hoelzer *T*-2 for his services.
Mary E. Sommer, corporate counsel for Stamford, said 0 the city has discussed several possible plans for *PRO* displaying the mural, which *T*-1 portrays various scenes from the Great Depression.
She said 0 the mural "preserves an era in Stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done *-1 *T*-2.
IF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence, it would probably be a one - word sentence: *PRO* Diversify.
*PRO* Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted * this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc., serious investors have taken that advice to heart.
Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal's poll, *PRO* providing an in - depth look at their portfolios.
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified.
By *PRO*-1 spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives, the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area, be it stocks, bonds or real estate.
For example, about 88% of Journal readers owned stock (down slightly from 91% in a similar poll last year).
But only 17.5% said 0 they had more than half their money in the stock market.
Similarly, 57% of respondents own shares in a money - market mutual fund, and 33% own municipal bonds.
But only 6% to 7% *U* of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives.
The poll, conducted * Aug. 7 - 28, also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics.
It found them in a cautious, but not downbeat, mood.
Of 1,500 people sent * a questionnaire, 951 *T*-1 replied.
The response rate, more than 63%, allows the results to be interpreted *-1 with a high degree of confidence.
The results can't be extrapolated *-1 to all investors, though.
Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000 *U*.
Nearly half of the respondents (47%) said 0 their investment portfolio was worth $250,000 *U* or more, and 17% said 0 it was worth $1 million *U* or more.
The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets, but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were *?* a year ago.
For example, 12% of this year's respondents said 0 they expect a recession within 12 months.
Last year, only 8% were expecting a recession.
An additional 56% of this year's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months.
Only 42% of last year's respondents anticipated slowing growth.
Apparently, the respondents don't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.
A slim majority (51%) think 0 stock prices will be higher *ICH*-1 in August 1990 than they were *?* in August 1989.
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.
Some 50% expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months.
By contrast, only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.
Since gold tends *-1 to soar when inflation is high *T*-2, that finding suggests that people believe 0 inflation remains under control.
Even though only 12% actually predicted a recession, many respondents were taking a better - safe - than sorry investment stance.
Nearly a third said 0 they have made some portfolio changes *PRO*-1 to anticipate a possible recession.
For the most part, the changes were "slight."
The two - thirds who *T*-2 haven't tried *PRO*-5 to make their portfolios more recession - resistant were split *-1 about evenly between investors who "*T*-3 don't believe in *PRO*-6 trying *PRO*-7 to predict the markets" (about 31%) and investors who *T*-4 "don't expect a recession" (about 15%) or are "unsure if and when a recession might come *T*-8" (about 22%).
A *PRO* buy - and - hold approach to stocks continues *-1 to be the rule among respondents.
Most own two to 10 stocks, and buy or sell no more than three times a year.
Some 71% had bought some stock in the past year; only 57% had sold any.
But the lurking shadow of 1987's stock - market crash still seems *-1 dark.
About 33% considered another crash "likely," while about 63% said 0 one is "unlikely."
Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year's poll.
And the respondents' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual.
About 60% of them said 0 they would "ordinarily" have at least 25% of their money in stocks.
But as of August, only 50% actually had stock - market investments of that size.
Most stock - market indexes were hitting all - time highs at around the time of the poll.
But it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign *PRO* to be cautious, rather than a signal *PRO* to jump on the bandwagon.

Moody's Investors Service said 0 it lowered its rating on about $75 million *U* of this Chatsworth, Calif., concern's convertible subordinated debentures, due 2012, to Caa from B2.
It said 0 the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused * by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives.

Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it lowered its rating on about $400 million *U* of this bank holding company's senior debt to B2 from Ba3.
Moody's said 0 it expects Valley National, of Phoenix, Ariz., to make substantial further provisions against its real - estate portfolio, and that it continues *-1 to suffer from the high cost of *PRO* carrying nonperforming assets, and from high loan - loss provisions.
Canadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14, down 5.3% from the preceding week's total of 291,890 tons, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said 0 *T*-1.
The week's total was down 7.1% from 297,446 tons a year earlier.
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds.
The cumulative total in 1989 was 12,283,217 tons, up 7.5% from 11,429,243 tons a year earlier.
China's slide toward recession is beginning *-1 to look like a free fall.
In a report on China's foundering economy, the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9% from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September.
Retail sales are plummeting, while consumer prices still are rising.
Chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation: low growth and high inflation.
"The economy is crashing hard," says *T*-1 an Asian economist in Beijing.
"The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected."
A lengthy recession, if it materializes, would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers.
Experts predict 0 the coming year will be characterized *-1 by flat or negative industrial growth, rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit.
Unless the government suddenly reverses course, wages for most workers won't keep pace with inflation, *PRO* creating a potential source of urban unrest.
The economy's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched * in September 1988 *PRO* to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation.
(Industrial output surged 21% in 1988, while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30%.)
The slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw - materials shortages that *T*-1 force many factories *PRO*-2 to restrict operations to two or three days a week.
In Western, market - driven countries, recessions often have a bright side: *PRO* prodding the economy to greater efficiency.
In China, however, there isn't likely *-1 to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state.
Instead, China is likely *-2 to shell out ever - greater subsidies to its coddled state - run enterprises, which *T*-1 ate up $18 billion *U* in bailouts last year.
Nor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely *PRO*-1 to be allowed *PRO*-2 to go bankrupt.
Rather, the brunt of the slowdown will be felt *-1 in the fast - growing private and semi-private "township" enterprises, which *T*-2 have fallen into disfavor as China's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership.
"When the going gets rough *T*-1, China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent," says *T*-2 a Western economist.
Reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks.
The meeting is expected *-1 to call for heightened austerity for two years.
But with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing, some voices may call for measures 0 *T*-1 to pump new life into the economy.
Some analysts believe 0 China soon will begin *-1 relaxing economic controls, particularly by *PRO*-2 loosening credit.
That would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino - foreign joint ventures, both of which *T*-2 have been plagued *-1 by shortages of working capital.
A dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens, if *PRO*-1 unchecked, *PRO*-1 to bring the economy to a collapse.
One sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision *ICH*-3 this week of People's Bank of China, the central bank, *PRO* to allocate $5.4 billion *U* in short - term loans *PRO*-1 to pay farmers for the autumn harvest, the official China Daily reported 0 *T*-2.
But while *PRO* pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries, it also runs the risk of *PRO* triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation.
The cycle has been repeated *-1 several times since China began *-2 reforming its planned economy in 1979.
And, because China's leaders have abandoned plans *PRO* to drastically reform the economy, it is likely *-2 to continue, analysts say 0 *T*-1.
The statistical bureau's report, cited * in China Daily, notes that industrial output in September totaled $29.4 billion *U*, a rise of just 0.9% from a year earlier.
Output declined in several provinces, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang, two key coastal areas, and Sichuan, the nation's agricultural breadbasket.
Production in Shanghai, China's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government, fell 1.8% for the month.
Nationwide, output of light industrial products declined 1.8%--"the first decline in 10 years," a bureau spokesman told China Daily 0 *T*-1.
In an unusually direct statement, the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers' goods.
"This will prevent a slide in industrial production, which *T*-1 will otherwise cause new panic buyings," the spokesman said *T*-2.
The University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by *PRO*-1 reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba - Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp.
The University said 0 the two companies agreed *PRO*-1 to spend 25 million Canadian dollars ($21.3 million *U*) over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in *PRO*-2 acquiring the vaccine maker.
It said 0 $10 million *U* would go to the University of Toronto.
Ciba - Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$866 million *U* for Connaught, and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$942 million *U*.
The University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid, *PRO*-2 arguing that Connaught's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught's ownership wouldn't be transferred *-1 to foreigners.
The university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba - Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid.
It said 0 the new agreement would "replace" the old one that *T*-1 forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover.
"Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught, this accord would enhance research and development in Canada," said *T*-1 James Keffer, the university's vice president of research.
Ciba - Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based *-1 in Emeryville, Calif.
In a statement, Jacques - Francois Martin, director general of Merieux, said 0 the French company is still determined *PRO*-1 to acquire Connaught.
While he didn't comment directly on the pact between Ciba - Geigy and the university, he said 0 Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies "not currently producing and marketing vaccines {who} *T*-2 can only promise this for some...years in the future."
In national over - the - counter trading yesterday, Connaught closed at $28.625 *U*, up $1.25 *U*.
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage.
That was the message delivered * by government and private security experts at an all - day conference on corporate electronic espionage.
"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies," said *T*-1 Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md.
It "may well be" that theft of business data is "as serious a strategic threat to national security" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said 0 *T*-2 Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs.
The conference was jointly sponsored *-1 by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry - government trade group.
Any secret can be pirated *-1, the experts said 0 *?*, if it is transmitted *-2 over the air.
Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder.
They need only *-1 position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait.
"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time," Mr. Matchett said *T*-1, *PRO*-2 adding: "It's a pretty good bet 0 they won't get caught *-3."
The only way 0 *PRO* to catch an electronic thief *T*-1, he said 0 *?*, is *PRO* to set him up with erroneous information.
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said 0 *T*-1.
By contrast, European firms will spend $150 million *U* this year on electronic security, and are expected *-1 to spend $1 billion *U* by 1992.
Already many foreign firms, especially banks, have their own cryptographers, conference speakers reported 0 *T*-1.
Still, *PRO* encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy.
One expert, whose job *T*-1 is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldn't be named or quoted *-2, said 0 the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer - maintenance workers, for example, doubling as foreign spies.
Moreover, he said *?*, technology *ICH*-3 now exists for *PRO* stealing corporate secrets after they've been "erased *-1" from a computer's memory.
He said that Oliver North of Iran - Contra notoriety thought 0 he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved *-1 for congressional committees to read.
No personal computer, not even the one on a chief executive's desk, is safe, this speaker noted 0 *T*-1.
W. Mark Goode, president of Micronyx Inc., a Richardson, Texas, firm that *T*-1 makes computer - security products, provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign for greater openness, known * commonly as glasnost.
Under Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Goode said 0 *?*, the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications.
He cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who *T*-2 recently put out bids *ICH*-1 via telex for an oil tanker 0 *T*-3 to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East.
Among the responses 0 the Swiss trader got *T*-2 was *T*-3 one from the Soviet national shipping company, which *T*-1 hadn't been invited *-4 *PRO*-5 to submit a bid.
The Soviets' eavesdropping paid off, however, because they got the contract.
They didn't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as *PRO* scheduled, and they didn't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either.
But you knew that, didn't you *?*?
They are supposed *-1 to play the game next Tuesday, in Candlestick Park here.
The theory is that the stadium, damaged * by Tuesday's earthquake, will be repaired *-1 by then, and that people will be able *PRO*-2 to get there.
Like just about everything else, that remains *PRO*-2 to be seen *-1.
Aftershocks could intervene.
But, at least, the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side.
It *EXP*-1 may seem *-3 trivial *PRO* to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought * by Tuesday's quake, but the name of this column is "On Sports," so I feel obliged *PRO*-2 to do so.
You might be interested *PRO*-1 to know that baseball, not survival, appeared *-2 to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000 - odd that *T*-3 had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, a half - hour before game time, when the quake struck *T*-4.
As soon as the tremor passed, many people spontaneously arose and cheered, as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show.
One fan, seated * several rows in front of the open, upper - deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed *-2 *T*-3, faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted, "We arranged that just for you guys!"
I thought *RNR*-1 and, I'm sure, others did *?* *RNR*-1: "You shouldn't have bothered."
I'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster, a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City, Mich., so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things: the urge *PRO* to talk about them.
*PRO*-2 Perhaps primed *-3 by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people's faces and asking how they "feel" about one calamity or another *T*-4, fellow reporters and civilians who *T*-1 spied my press credential were eager *PRO*-2 to chat.
"It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by," said *T*-1 one man, *PRO*-2 describing my own reaction.
A women said 0 she saw the park's light standards sway.
A man said 0 he saw the upper rim undulate.
I saw neither.
Dictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding, the general inclination was *PRO* to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played *-1.
"I was near the top of the stadium, and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat *T*-2, but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes," confessed *T*-1 a friend.
"I guess 0 I thought, ` This is the World Series and I'm not gon *-1 na wimp out!"'
Here in the Global Village, though, folks do not stay uninformed for long.
Electrical power was out in still - daylighted Candlestick Park, but battery - operated radios and television sets were plentiful.
Within a few minutes, the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear.
Its Richter Scale measurement was reported *-1 as 6.5, then 6.9, then 7.0.
A section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed, as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland *?*.
People had died.
At 5:40 p.m., scheduled game time having passed, some fans chanted "*PRO* Let's Play Ball."
*PRO*-1 No longer innocent, they qualified as fools.
The stadium was ordered *-1 evacuated *-3 soon afterward; the announcement, made * over police bullhorns, cited the power outage, but it *EXP*-4 later was revealed *-2 that there also had been damage of the sort reported * by my friend.
Outside, I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete.
"Pieces of Candlestick," they said *T*-1.
The crowd remained good natured, even bemused.
TV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while, a few feet away, others watched the interviews on their portable TVs.
The only frenzy 0 I saw *T*-3 was commercial: Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged *-1 by fledgling speculators who *T*-2 saw future profit in the items.
The traffic jam out of the park was monumental.
It *EXP*-1 took me a half - hour *PRO* to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle, and an additional hour *PRO* to reach an inner roadway a half - block away.
The six - mile trip to my airport hotel that *T*-1 had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours.
At my hotel, the Westin, power was out, some interior plaster had broken *PRO*-1 loose and there had been water damage, but little else.
With Garpian randomness, a hotel across the street, the Amfac, had been hit *-1 harder: A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn *-2 away.
The Westin staff had, kindly, set out lighted candles in the ballroom, prepared a cold - cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets.
I fell *PRO*-1 asleep on the lobby floor, next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket.
I expected him to say, "I told you so," but he already was snoring.
The journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem *-1 unimportant.
My response was that sports rarely are important, only diverting, and the quake merely highlighted that fact.
Should the rest of the Series be played *-1 at all?
Sure.
The quake and baseball weren't related *-1, unlike the massacre of athletes that *T*-2 attended the 1972 Olympics.
That heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience, and seems doomed *PRO*-1 to repeat it.
Two ironies intrude.
This has been widely dubbed *-1 *-2 *PRO*-4 the BART Series *ICH*-3, after the local subway line, and the Bay Bridge Series.
Flags fly at half - staff for the death of Bart Giamatti, the late baseball commissioner, and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins.
A Series that *T*-1 was shaping up as the dullest since the one - sided Detroit - over - San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way.
Still, its edge is lost *-1.
It now will be played mostly for the record, and should be wrapped up *-1 as quickly as possible, without "off" days.
And I will never again complain about a rainout.
WALL STREET, *PRO* SHAKE hands with George Orwell.
The author of the futuristic novel "1984" invented a language called *PRO* *PRO*-3 Newspeak that *T*-1 made it *EXP*-2 impossible *PRO* to fully develop a heretical thought--that is, anything negative about the policies and practices of the state.
Wall Street hasn't gotten that far yet, but it has made a promising start.
Its language--*PRO* call it *PRO*-2 Streetspeak--is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed *PRO*-1 to make financial products and maneuvers appear *-3 better, safer or cheaper than they really are *?*.
When something undeniably nasty happens *T*-2, a few euphemisms are deployed *-3 *PRO* to simply make it disappear, much as a fresh grave may be covered *-1 by a blanket of flowers.
For example, we'll bet 0 you thought that the stock market crashed two years ago.
Wrong.
According to some of the grand panjandrums of the market, it never happened.
In their lexicon the 508 - point collapse in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Oct. 19, 1987, was just a big blip.
*PRO*-1 Trotting out a much - beloved Streetspeak term, New York Stock Exchange Chairman John Phelan recently declared that history would record the event as only "a major technical correction."
(Another much - beloved saying, however, this one in plain English, holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.
On Oct. 29, 1929--a date 0 historians stubbornly insist on *PRO*-2 associating *T*-1 with the dreaded C - word--the DJ industrials fell 12.8%.
In the "technical correction" of two years ago, they lost a whopping 22.6%.)
Customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who *T*-1 try *PRO*-2 to sell them stock.
These people used *-2 to be called *-1 *PRO*-4 brokers, but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction, when terrified customers couldn't raise brokers on the phone *T*-3.
Either way, the word "broker" is clearly out of favor.
Of the major New York - based securities firms, only Morgan Stanley & Co. *T*-1 still calls its salespeople *PRO*-2 brokers.
At Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., they are "financial consultants."
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Prudential Bache Securities, and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., they are "account executives."
At PaineWebber Inc., they are "investment executives."
Such titles are designed *PRO*-1 to convey a sense of dignified, broad - scale competence and expertise in *PRO* selling today's myriad financial products.
It is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves, *PRO*-2 overwhelmed *-3 by all the new things being dreamed up * 0 for them to peddle *T*-4, don't feel *T*-1.
"It s almost product de jour," grouses *T*-1 one account executive at Dean Witter.
The transmogrified brokers never let the C - word cross their lips, *PRO*-2 instead stressing such terms as "safe," "insured" and "guaranteed"--even though these terms may be severely limited *-1 in their application to a particular new financial product.
The names of some of these products don't suggest the risk involved * in *PRO* buying them, either.
A case in point: "government - plus" bond funds.
What could *T*-1 imply more safety than *PRO* investing in government bonds?
What could *T*-1 be better than *PRO* getting a tad more income *ICH*-2 from them (the plus) than other people?
Indeed, conservative investors, many of them elderly, have poured more than $50 billion *U* into such funds, which *T*-1 promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds--*PRO* only to learn later that these funds use part of their money *PRO*-2 to dabble in high - risk bond options, a gambler's game.
When a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished *-1 *T*-2, *PRO* look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker.
This seems *-1 to be happening now to limited partnerships, many of which *T*-2 either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments.
They are still being sold *-1, but more and more often as "direct investments"--with all the same risks 0 they had *T*-2 under the old label.
In such cases, the game hasn't changed, only the name.
In others a familiar old name still prevails, but the underlying game has changed.
For example, "no load" mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they don't carry a frontend sales commission.
*PRO* Getting out of them, however, may be a different story now.
Traditional no - loads made their money by *PRO*-1 charging an annual management fee, usually a modest one; they imposed no other fees, and many still don't *?*.
In recent years, though, a passel of others flying the no - load flag have been imposing hefty charges--all the way up to 6%--when an investor sells his shares *T*-1.
Shouldn't they properly be called *-1 *PRO*-2 exit - load funds?
The mutual - fund industry is debating the question, but *PRO* don't expect a new name while the old one is working so well.
And *PRO* don't expect anyone to change the term "blue chip," either, even though some of the companies that *T*-1 still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were *?*.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., for one, is still a favorite of widows, orphans and trust departments--but *PRO*-1 shorn *-2 of its regional telephone units and exposed *-2 to competition on every side, it is a far different investment prospect than it was *?* before divestiture.
Also, blue chips in general have suffered much more short - term price volatility in recent years.
Larry Biehl, a money manager in San Mateo, Calif., blames that on the advent of program trading, in which computers used * by big institutional investors are programmed *-2 *PRO*-4 to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail *T*-3 *T*-1.
Blue chips, he says 0 *?*, "are now being referred to *-1 as poker chips."
Finally, even the time - honored strategy called *PRO* "*PRO*-2 value investing" no longer means what it once did *?* *T*-1.
Before the takeover mania of the '80s, it referred to *PRO* rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks, especially those with shrewd management, sound fundamentals and decent prospects.
Now, says 0 *?* Mr. Biehl, value investing often means "*PRO* looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that *T*-1 are in real trouble."
To institutional investors or brokers, he adds 0 *?*, a company with value is a company at risk of *PRO* being swallowed up *-2.

Democracy can be cruel to politicians: Sometimes it forces them *PRO*-1 to make choices.
Now that the Supreme Court opened the door on the subject of abortion, politicians are squinting under the glare of democratic choice.
Their discomfort is a healthy sign for the rest of us.
Republicans are squinting most painfully, at least at first, which *T*-2 is only fair because they've been shielded *-1 the most.
So long as abortion was a question for litigation, not legislation, Republicans could find political security in absolutism.
They could attract one - issue voters by *PRO*-1 adopting the right - to - life movement's strongest position, even as pro-choice Republicans knew 0 this mattered little on an issue monopolized * by the court.
Now it matters.
Much of Washington thought 0 it detected George Bush in a characteristic waffle on abortion the past week.
Only a month ago he'd warned Congress *PRO*-1 not to pass legislation *PRO* to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest.
Last Friday, after Congress passed it anyway, he hinted 0 he was looking for compromise.
Was the man who *T*-1 once was pro-choice, but later pro-life, converting again?
In fact, Mr. Bush's dance was more wiggle than waffle.
Pro-life advocates say 0 the White House never wavered over the veto.
Christopher Smith (R., N.J.), a pro-life leader in the House, suggested a compromise that *T*-1 would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states.
The White House, *PRO*-2 never eager for a fight, was happy *PRO*-2 to try, which *T*-1 is why George Bush said 0 he was looking for "flexibility" last week *T*-3.
When Democrats refused *PRO*-2 to budge *T*-1, pro-life Republicans met at the White House with Chief of Staff John Sununu on Monday, and Mr. Bush quickly signaled a veto.
Amid charges of "timidity" on Panama and elsewhere, the president wasn't about *-1 to offend his most energetic constituency.
The GOP doubters were in Congress.
In last week's House vote, 41 Republicans defected.
After the vote, Connecticut Rep. Nancy Johnson rounded up nearly as many signatures on a letter to Mr. Bush urging him *T*-1 not to veto.
Even such a pro-life stalwart as Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) had counseled some kind of compromise.
The Senate passed the same bill yesterday, with a veto - proof majority of 67.
The manuevering illustrates an emerging Republican donnybrook, pacified * since the early 1980s.
At the 1988 GOP convention, abortion was barely discussed *-1 at all, though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment.
Ms. Johnson made a passionate statement to the platform committee, but she was talking to herself.
Now many Republicans are listening.
They're frightened by what they see *T*-1 in New Jersey, and especially Virginia, where pro-life GOP candidates for governor are being pummeled *-3 on abortion *T*-2.
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant, says 0 the two GOP candidates could have avoided trouble if they had framed the issue first.
(In Virginia, Marshall Coleman and his running mate, Eddy Dalton, are both on the defensive for *PRO* opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest.)
But Mr. Mahe adds, "The net loser in the next few years is the right - to - life side."
Darla St. Martin, of the National Right to Life Committee, says 0 exit polls from the 1988 election had single - issue, pro-life voters giving Mr. Bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave Michael Dukakis.
But the Supreme Court's opening of debate may have changed even that.
GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, of the Wirthlin Group, says 0 polls this summer showed that the single - issue voters had about evened out.
Polls are no substitute for principle, but they'll do for some politicians.
The Republican danger is 0 that abortion could become for them what it's long been *T*-1 for Democrats, a divisive litmus test.
It's already that in the Bush administration, at least for any job in which abortion is even remotely an issue *T*-1.
Oklahoma official Robert Fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the Department of Health and Human Services after right - to - life activists opposed him.
Caldwell Butler, a conservative former congressman, was barred *-1 from a Legal Services post, after he gave wrong answers on abortion.
Even the president's doctor, Burton Lee, has said on the record that he'd love *PRO*-1 to be surgeon general but couldn't pass the pro-life test.
In the case of HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, the litmus test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the Republican coalition.
After Mr. Sullivan waffled on abortion last year, the White House appeased right - to - lifers by *PRO*-1 surrounding him with pro-life deputies.
Their views on health care and welfare didn't much matter, though HHS spends billions a year on both.
It makes only a handful of abortion - related decisions.
Though Democrats can gloat at all this for now, they may want *PRO*-1 to contain their glee.
On abortion, their own day will come.
Eventually even Republicans will find a way 0 *PRO* to frame the issue in ways that *T*-1 expose pro-choice absolutism *T*-2.
Does the candidate favor parental consent for teen - age abortions?
(The pro-choice lobby doesn't *?*.
) What about *PRO* banning abortions in the second and third trimesters?
(The lobby says no again.)
Democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise, toward the unpolarizing middle.
Roe v. Wade pre-empted political debate, so the extremes blossomed.
Now the ambivalent middle, a moral majority of sorts, is reasserting itself.
Within a few years, the outcome in most states is likely *-1 to be that abortion will be more restricted, but not completely banned.
This is where the voters are *T*-2, which *T*-1 is where politicians usually end up *T*-3.
First they get us to buy computers so we can get more information.
Then the computers give us more information than we can ever read *?*.
Now they plan *PRO*-2 to sell us products that *T*-1 sift through all the information *PRO*-3 to give us what we really want *PRO*-5 to know *T*-4.
The products range from computer - edited, personal newsletters to systems that *T*-1 sit inside a personal computer and pick stories on selected topics off news wires.
"Filtered news is what people want *T*-2," says *T*-3 Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter that *T*-1 spots new developments.
"Most people read 10 times more than necessary in order *PRO*-1 to find out what they really need *T*-2."
Geoffrey Goodfellow, who *T*-1 dropped out of high school back in the 1970s *PRO*-2 to manage a computer network at a California research firm, says: "Old network hands have started *-3 to turn off the network because they don't have time 0 *PRO* to wade through the muck *T*-4."
Mr. Goodfellow has started a Menlo Park, Calif., company called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Anterior Technology that *T*-1 provides human editors for public electronic networks.
"I see it as a sewage treatment plant," he says *T*-1.
A new product, NewsEdge, carries five business news wires simultaneously into a user's computer and beeps and flashes whenever an article *ICH*-2 appears *T*-3 that *T*-1 is of interest to the user.
The product, developed * by Desktop Data Corp., a new company based * in Waltham, Mass., scans the wires *PRO*-2 looking for articles that *T*-1 contain key words specified * by the user.
One early user, David Semmel, a Chicago venture capitalist and investor in Desktop Data, says 0 he uses it *PRO*-1 to track takeover developments.
He says 0 he told NewsEdge *PRO*-1 to look for stories containing such words as takeover, acquisition, acquire, LBO, tender, merger, junk and halted.
"I'm pretty confident 0 I'm catching everything," he says *T*-1.
NewsEdge is pricey: $7,500 *U* a year for a limited version, $40,000 *U* a year if the cost of all the news wires is included *-1.
And it works best in high - powered personal computers.
But some investors and consultants who *T*-1 have tried it are enthusiastic.
Jeffrey Tarter, editor of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass., industry newsletter, says: "I've seen a lot of people fooling around on the fringes of filtering information.
This is the first time 0 I've seen something 0 I could imagine a lot of people using *T*-2 *T*-1."
NewsEdge uses an FM radio band *PRO*-2 to carry news wires provided * by Reuters, McGraw - Hill and Dow Jones & Co., as well as PR Newswire, which *T*-1 carries corporate press releases.
An FM receiver attached * to a user's personal computer receives the information.
Some organizations have devised their own systems 0 *T*-1 to sort through news wire items as they come in.
George Goodwin, an account manager at Royal Bank of Canada, adapted a Lotus Development Corp. program called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Agenda *PRO*-1 to sort through international news wires.
It automatically selects stories from particular countries for reading by the international bankers responsible for lending in those areas.
For those who *T*-1 don't need their personalized information moment by moment, some services are offering overnight newsletters.
Individual Inc., a new company in Brookline, Mass., uses filtering technology developed * by Cornell University computer scientist Gerard Salton, *PRO*-1 to automatically produce customized newsletters 0 it sends *T*-2 electronically to subscribers by 8 a.m. the next day.
"We are operating an information refinery that *T*-1 takes a broad stream of raw data and turns it into actionable knowledge," says *T*-2 Yosi Amram, founder and president.
The daily newsletter, which *T*-1 isn't widely available yet, will have a base cost of $2,000 *U* a year and provides full text of relevant articles under license agreements with Reuters, McGraw Hill, United Press International, two press release news wires and Japan's Kyodo news service.
One early user is NEC Corp.'s U.S. printer marketing arm.
"They want the full press releases on printer announcements by their competition," Mr. Amram says *T*-1.
It also tracks personnel and financial announcements by NEC's distributors and customers.
Individual Inc.'s technology goes beyond word searches by *PRO*-1 using a computerized thesaurus.
If a customer asks for stories about "IBM," the computer will also supply stories that *T*-1 mention "I.B.M., International Business Machines, or Big Blue," Mr. Amram says 0 *T*-2.
Moreover, Individual Inc.'s computers can weigh the value of an article based on how closely the story matches the subscriber's interest area *T*-1.
It compares the position of key words in the story; words in the headline or first paragraph get a higher value.
And it calculates how often the words appear in the story *T*-1 compared with how often they appear in the entire data base *T*-2.
The higher the ratio of hits to total words, the higher the presumed value to the reader.
Pinpoint Information Corp., Chantilly, Va., a producer of $1,800 - a - year personalized newsletters about the computer industry that *T*-1 started full operation last month, relies on 12 human readers *PRO*-2 to code news releases by topic in order *PRO*-3 to select items for each subscriber.
"The computers find all the key words 0 they can *?* *T*-1, but the editors confirm every one.
Computer picking isn't perfect," says *T*-1 Harvey Golomb, president and founder of Pinpoint.
The humans also write abstracts of articles from some 200 computer industry publications.
Once all the articles are coded *-2 and put *-2 in a data base, Pinpoint's computers pick the most relevant for each subscriber and lay them out in a three - to - five - page newsletter format; each newsletter is sent *-1 directly from the computer to the subscriber's fax machine.
Mr. Golomb says 0 each of his computers can produce and send about 75 unique newsletters a night.
Many computer network users who *T*-1 never see news wires would like *PRO*-2 to sort through their electronic mail automatically.
So - called E-mail is the collection of inter-office memos, gossip, technical data, schedules and directives distributed * over local and national computer networks.
"All these interconnected computers make it *EXP*-4 difficult *PRO* to sort out what *T*-1's junk and what *T*-2's important," says *T*-5 Chuck Digate, a former Lotus Development executive who *T*-3 has started a new company 0 *T*-6 to cope with the problem.
Mr. Digate says 0 his firm, Beyond Inc., has licensed technology known * as Information Lens from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and plans *PRO*-1 to develop it for commercial use.
The MIT project devised ways 0 for E-mail to be automatically categorized *-1 as top priority if it comes from certain designated senders or requires action in the next couple of days *T*-2.
Mr. Digate says that Beyond will refine the product "so the message will be smart enough 0 *T*-1 to know *PRO*-2 to come back and bother you again next week."
And if a user is busy, "he can set it for crisis mode: ` *PRO* Don't bother me with reports until Monday."'
A program called *PRO* *PRO*-4 Notes, which *T*-1 is under development by Lotus, also is designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to sort E-mail sent * within work groups.
One thing that *T*-1 makes E-mail difficult 0 *PRO* to sift through *T*-2 is that each item looks the same.
Notes, which *T*-2 is designed *-1 for advanced computers that *T*-3 display graphics, allows mail senders to put different logos on their mail.
A daily news briefing from the company librarian, for example, would have a distinctive format on the screen, just as a paper version would have *?*.
"With E-mail, you don't have the visual clues of paper," says *T*-1 Mr. Tarter, the editor of SoftLetter.
"With Notes, they're visually distinct.
What's *T*-1 in a name?
Apparently a lot, according to the British firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells.
The British firm has begun court proceedings in London *PRO*-1 to prevent the use of the name "Deloitte" by Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. in England and the rest of the world.
The British Deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of Deloitte and Touche world - wide and joined Coopers & Lybrand.
John Bullock, senior partner of Deloitte in the U.K., said "the decision *PRO* to start these proceedings hasn't been taken *-1 lightly."
Mr. Bullock said 0 the British firm has used the name "Deloitte" since 1845.
In the U.S., Deloitte, Haskins & Sells was known *-1 as Haskins & Sells until 1978, when it added the "Deloitte" name of its British affiliate *T*-2.
John C. Burton, an accounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, said "there's a lot of emotion involved * in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in England, where accounting predates the U.S. *T*-1."
Although accountants aren't noted *-1 as "*PRO*-2 being deeply emotional, they really hold it all in," said *T*-3 Mr. Burton, former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
J. Michael Cook, chairman of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells International, said 0 he believes the legal action by the British firm "to be without merit."
Mr. Cook said that last June, the international executive committes of Deloitte and Touche agreed to a world - wide merger.
"The merger is proceeding according to plan, except as to the withdrawal of the Deloitte U.K. firm," he said *T*-1.
Partners at other accounting firms say that the Deloitte firm in the U.K. is filing the suit *PRO*-1 to get even with the merged Deloitte - Touche firm for *PRO*-2 keeping major auditing work in England.
General Motors Corp., a Deloitte audit client, for example, has agreed *PRO*-2 to keep its annual $18 million *U* world - wide audit and associated tax work with the merged Deloitte - Touche firm, 0 *T*-3 to be known *-1 as Deloitte & Touche in the U.S. .
In England, this would mean that the British Deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of GM's Vauxhill unit.
The defection of Deloitte's affiliates in Britain and the Netherlands to Coopers & Lybrand will make Coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in Europe, *PRO*-1 rivaling KPMG Peat Marwick there.
Although Coopers hasn't been courted *-1 by other major accounting firms for a merger, it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the Deloitte - Touche merger.
In New York, Harris Amhowitz, general counsel of Coopers, said 0 Coopers "was aware of the litigation," but he declined further comment.
He also declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the name that Coopers would use *T*-2 in England if Deloitte UK won its litigation 0 *PRO* to keep its name *T*-3.
Coopers uses the Coopers & Lybrand name world - wide.
William Bennett, the White House drug - policy director, accused local officials in the Washington area of *PRO*-1 blocking construction of prison facilities 0 *T*-2 to house convicted drug dealers.
"Politics has essentially put up a roadblock" to *PRO* finding sites for new federal prisons, Mr. Bennett said 0 *T*-1 at a news conference called * *PRO* to report on his "emergency assistance program" for the capital.
Without more space 0 *PRO* to incarcerate convicted criminals *T*-1, he added 0 *?*, "we will not win the war on drugs."
Mr. Bennett declared in April that he would make Washington a "test case" for how the Bush administration would aid cities afflicted * by heavy drug trafficking and violence *T*-1.
The drug czar claimed that enforcement efforts are working here, "albeit at a slower and more halting pace than we would like *?*."
He acknowledged, however, that Washington's "drug - related murder rate is intolerably high.
The prisons are too crowded.
Drugs continue *-2 to be sold *-1 openly around schools, parks and housing projects."
Mr. Bennett declined *PRO*-1 to name the area officials who he believes 0 *T*-2 have impeded plans for *PRO* building more federal prisons *PRO* to ease Washington's problem.
But other Bush administration officials have criticized Maryland Gov. William Schaefer for *PRO*-1 blocking the use of possible sites in that state.
Administration officials also have said that Washington Mayor Marion Barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city.
In a letter to Mr. Bennett's office, released * yesterday, Washington's city administrator, Carol Thompson, complained that the drug czar had exaggerated the amount of federal drug - related assistance provided * to the capital.
*PRO*-1 Referring to Mr. Bennett's claim that the federal government would provide $97 million *U* in emergency federal support, Ms. Thompson wrote, "Our analysis was unable *PRO*-2 to even come close to *PRO*-3 documenting that figure."
Of his successes in Washington, Mr. Bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of 375 local inmates.
He also noted that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has established a federal - local task force responsible since April for 106 arrests and more than $2 million *U* in seizures of drug dealers' assets.
The Defense Department has lent the Washington U.S. attorney 10 prosecutors, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training, he added 0 *T*-1.
The Federal Trade Commission ruled that five major title - insurance companies illegally fixed prices for title search - and - examination services by *PRO*-1 participating in joint "rating bureaus" in six states.
The FTC ordered the companies *PRO*-1 not to use rating bureaus in those six states.
The commission order named the following companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California, a unit of Los Angeles - based Ticor; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co., units of Chicago Title & Trust Co.; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., a unit of Richmond, Va. - based Universal Corp.; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co., a unit of Houston - based Stewart Information Services Corp.
Chicago Title & Trust acquired Safeco in 1987 and changed the unit's name to Security Union Title Insurance Co.
The FTC ruled that the companies violated federal antitrust law by *PRO*-1 fixing rates in the following states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona and Montana.
The FTC first issued an administrative complaint in the case in 1985.
John Christie, a lawyer here for the two Chicago Title & Trust units accused the FTC of *PRO*-1 "second - guessing" state - level regulations, with which, he said 0 *T*-3, his clients had complied *T*-2.
"I expect all the companies to appeal," he added *T*-1.
A lawyer for Lawyers Title said that, because the named companies no longer use the type of cooperative rating bureaus attacked * by the FTC, the commission's order won't have much practical impact.
Officials for the other named companies didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.
Lufthansa AG said 0 passenger volume climbed 5.2% for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year - earlier period.
The West German national air carrier said 0 cargo volume jumped 12% to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago.
Load factor, or percentage of seats filled *, climbed to 67.1% from 66.6%, even though the number of flights rose 6.9% to 215,845 in the first - three quarters.
From January through September, the distance flown * by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6% to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier, the company added 0 *T*-1.
WASHINGTON LIES LOW after the stock market's roller - coaster ride.
Lawmakers, *PRO*-1 haunted * by charges that some of their comments contributed to the 1987 crash, generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation.
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz SEC Chairman Breeden Wednesday, and Treasury Secretary Brady will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday.
The market's wild week may speed along the market - reform legislation that *T*-1 has been pending for months in the aftermath of the 1987 crash.
It may also expedite the SEC's modest pending changes in junk - bond disclosure rules and intensify the Treasury's look at plans for *PRO* giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short - term trades by pension funds.
Brady and Breeden work well together on the plunge, despite the fact that the Treasury secretary opposed Breeden's nomination to the SEC post.
BAKER FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics.
Despite *PRO*-1 seeing his plan for Israeli - Palestinian elections wither, the cautious secretary of state is so far unwilling *PRO*-1 to cut U.S. economic or military aid *PRO*-2 to force Israeli cooperation.
Baker nonetheless remains furious both at Shamir, for *PRO*-1 backing down on the elections, and at Shamir's rival, Peres, for political ineptitude in *PRO*-2 forcing a premature cabinet vote on Baker's plan.
Meanwhile, some U.S. officials fear 0 PLO chief Arafat is getting cold feet and may back off from his recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism.
He is under intense fire from other Palestinian groups; Syria is pushing Ahmad Jibril, whose terrorist band *T*-2 is blamed *-1 for the Pan Am 103 bombing, as an alternative to Arafat.
DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt him in Congress.
Republicans as well as Democrats were angered *-1 by the budget director's rejection of Speaker Foley's effort *PRO* to expedite a deficitcutting measure by *PRO*-2 stripping it of the capital - gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects.
Darman now blames the clash on miscommunication, but House GOP leader Michel, who *T*-2 carried the offer to him, observes, "I was speaking English *NOT* *NOT* at the time, and quite loud so I could be understood *-1."
Senate GOP leader Dole ridicules the budget chief on the Senate floor.
Democratic counterpart Mitchell, *PRO*-4 asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to interpret Darman's threat *PRO* to make permanent the across - the - board Gramm - Rudman cuts that *T*-1 took effect this week, says, "I don't even bother *PRO*-5 to interpret them."
But Darman suggests 0 such tensions will dissipate quickly.
"If I can show signs of maturity, almost anybody can *?*," he jokes *T*-1.
HHS OFFICIALS expect Secretary Sullivan to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue.
Before he was confirmed *-1, Sullivan said 0 he had "reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research."
But now, an official says 0 *?*, he is "surrounded *-1 by right - to - lifers," who *T*-2 contend that any breakthroughs in fetal - tissue research could increase the demand for abortions.
COOPERATION *ICH*-1 WANES on weapons development between the U.S. and Europe.
Britain, France and Italy pull out of a proposal *PRO* to build new NATO frigates; the U.S. and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects.
Defense experts say 0 joint projects are increasingly squeezed *-1 by budget pressures and the desire *PRO* to save domestic jobs; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears.
BOTH SIDES NOW:
Virginia GOP lieutenant governor candidate Eddy Dalton tries *PRO*-1 to have it both ways on the abortion issue.
Though she opposes abortion in almost all cases, she airs a TV commercial using pro-choice buzzwords.
"A woman ought *-1 to have a choice in cases where her life or health are in danger *T*-2 and in cases of rape or incest," she proclaims *T*-3.
HOT TOPIC:
Interest in the abortion issue is so great that the Hotline, a daily, computer - distributed political newsletter, comes up with a spinoff product called * *PRO*-1 the Abortion Report dealing solely with its political implications.
CONSERVATIVES EXPECT Bush to solidify their majority on a key court.
Bush has three vacancies 0 *PRO* to fill *T*-3 on the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court, which *T*-2 handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered *-1 a warm - up for future Supreme Court nominees.
Conservatives now hold only a 5 - 4 edge.
One slot is expected *-1 to go to EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas, a black conservative; after *PRO*-2 mulling a fight, liberals now probably won't put up a major struggle against him.
Other conservatives thought * to be on the administration's short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann, who *T*-1 was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, and Marshall Breger, chairman of a U.S. agency on administration.
The Bush administration would also like *PRO*-1 to nominate a woman; one possibility is former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing.
MINOR MEMOS:
In the wake of the failed Panama coup, a bumper sticker appears: "Ollie Would Have Got Him ."...
Rep. Garcia, on trial for bribery and extortion, puts statements *ICH*-1 in the Congressional Record attributing missed votes to "scheduling conflicts ."...
A GOP Senate fund - raising letter from Sen. Burns of Montana is made *-1 to appear *-2 personally written, and its opening line is, "Please *PRO* excuse my handwriting."
But Burns confesses in an interview: "That's not my handwriting.
Missouri farmer Blake Hurst writing in the fall issue of the Heritage Foundation's Policy Review about the proposed location of a hazardous - waste incinerator in his county:
Of course I'd rather *ICH*-1 have a computer software firm in my backyard than a hazardous waste incinerator.
But I'd also rather *ICH*-1 live next door to an incinerator than to some of the hog farms 0 I've seen (and smelt) *T*-2 in these parts.
An incinerator is also probably better than *PRO* having nobody next door--on our farm there are four unoccupied houses.
On my four - mile drive to farm headquarters each morning, I drive by another four empty houses.
A community of abandoned farmsteads, failing businesses, and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one....
The loss of 40 jobs by a depressed county in rural Missouri is hardly of national importance except for this: If the most environmentally safe way of *PRO* dealing with a national problem cannot be built *-1 in Atchinson County, what hope have *T*-3 we for *PRO* dealing with the wastes 0 our economy produces *T*-2?
After all, farmers here work with "hazardous" chemicals every day, many of them the same chemicals that *T*-2 would have been destroyed *-1 in the incinerator.
We know 0 they are dangerous, but if *PRO* handled *-1 with care, their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment.
Heidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans.
*PRO*-2 White, 24 years old, a singer in her church choir, she symbolizes a generation that *T*-1 gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan.
"I felt kind of safe," she says *T*-1.
No longer.
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion *T*-1, Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics.
*PRO*-1 Then a political novice, she stepped into a whirl of "pro-choice" marches, house parties and fund - raisers.
Now she leads a grassroots abortion - rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio.
"This is one where I cross party lines *T*-3," she says *T*-1, *PRO*-2 rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio's opponent, Reagan - Republican Rep. James Courter.
"People my age thought 0 it wasn't going *-1 to be an issue.
Now it has *?*--especially for people my age."
Polls bear out this warning, but after a decade of increased Republican influence here, the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned * upside down for Mr. Courter.
Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk *PRO*-1 losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month.
*PRO*-1 Going into the 1990s, the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to torment Democrats in the past.
This change comes less *ICH*-2 from a shift in public opinion, which *T*-1 hasn't changed much on abortion over the past decade, than in the boundaries of the debate.
New Jersey's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Webster vs. Missouri, has engaged voters across the nation who *T*-2 had been insulated *-1 from the issue.
Before July, pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without *PRO*-1 focusing narrowly on abortion.
Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, *PRO*-1 bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion - rights forces.
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted *-1 in cases of rape and incest.
"If Webster hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here," Linda Bowker tells a reporter *T*-1 in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women.
"We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter...and no one would have heard us."
New Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's - rights movement this year.
The infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures.
In Cherry Hill, the National Abortion Rights Action League, whose goal *T*-1 is *PRO* to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters, targets a union breakfast *PRO*-2 to build labor support for its cause.
The league organizers seem more *-3 a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders; "I wish 0 I could go *PRO*-2 work out," says *T*-1 a slim activist.
A labor chief speaks sardonically of *PRO* having *-1 to "man and woman" Election Day phones.
No age group is more sensitive than younger voters, like Ms. Ehman.
A year ago this fall, New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56% to 39% *U* over Michael Dukakis, according to a survey then by Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute.
A matching Eagleton - Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal.
Voters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55% to 29% *U* over Republican Courter.
Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in *PRO* judging a candidate *T*-1.
By a 2 - to - 1 ratio, voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio's stance on abortion, and polls indicate 0 his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked *-2 to the issue *T*-1.
"The times are my times," says *T*-1 Mr. Florio.
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I -'m coming - down - your - throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian - American ward.
After *PRO*-1 losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including *PRO*-1 deciding in recent years 0 he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions.
"If you're going *-3 to be consistent and say 0 it is a constitutionally protected right," he asks *?*, "how are you going *-5 to say 0 an upscale woman who *T*-1 can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who *T*-2 is not in great shape financially does not *?* *T*-4?"
Mr. Courter, by comparison, seems *-2 a shadow of the confident hawk who *T*-1 defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran - Contra hearings two years ago.
*PRO*-1 Looking back, he says 0 he erred by *PRO*-2 stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.
It is a distinction that *T*-1 satisfies neither side in the debate.
"He doesn't know himself," Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says *T*-1 of Mr. Courter's position.
Even abortion opponents, however angry with Mr. Florio, can't hide their frustration with the Republican's ambivalence.
"He doesn't want *PRO*-2 to lead the people," says *T*-1 Richard Traynor, president of New Jersey Right to Life.
Moreover, by *PRO*-1 stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment.
He hurt himself further this summer by *PRO*-1 bringing homosexual issues into the debate; and by *PRO*-2 wavering on this issue and abortion, he has weakened his credibility in what *T*-3 is already a mean - spirited campaign on both sides.
*PRO*-2 Elected to Congress in 1978, the 48 - year - old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who *T*-1 were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan.
Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy--*PRO*-1 even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors.
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences, and Mr. Courter's own conservative credentials proved *-1 useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor, Thomas Kean, in the 1981 Republican primary here.
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter's fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. Kean.
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in Washington, Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey's budget in his eight years in office.
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter, but this history makes it *EXP*-1 harder for the conservative to run against government.
Mr. Courter's free - market plan *PRO* to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean's own insurance commissioner.
Mr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed * to government regulation on behalf of consumers.
*PRO*-1 Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps, Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head.
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park.
Yet minutes after *PRO*-1 promising *PRO*-2 to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable *PRO*-1 to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office.
"I don't think 0 we do now," he says *T*-1.
"I think 0 we did."
*PRO*-1 Asked the same question after his appearance, Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today.
When he is presented *-1 with a poster celebrating the organization's 20th anniversary *T*-2, he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden.
Details and Camden are essential Florio.
*PRO*-1 Elected to Congress as a "Watergate baby" in 1974, he ran for governor three years later.
In the opinion of many, he hasn't stopped *-1 running since, even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985.
His base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him *PRO*-2 sustain a network of political - action committees 0 *T*-1 to preserve his edge.
With limited budgets for television in a high - priced market, Mr. Florio's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage.
More than ever, his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state.
Auto insurance rates are soaring.
A toxic - waste - dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer.
In Monmouth, an important swing area, Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising *PRO* to keep the county *PRO*-1 "clean and green."
Mr. Florio savors this vindication, but at age 52, the congressman is also a product of his times and losses.
He speaks for the death penalty as if *PRO* reading from Exodus 21; *PRO*-1 to increase state revenue he focuses not on "taxes" but on "audits" 0 *T*-2 to cut waste.
Hard - hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter's team, and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s.
*PRO*-1 Appealing to a young audience, he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead.
The lyric chosen *--"long strange night"--may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended * to portray each other as a liar.
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers *PRO* arising out of old machines, but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption.
His campaign hierarchy is chosen *-1 from elsewhere in the state, and *PRO*-2 faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment, he has so far blunted the issue by *PRO*-2 donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater, Trenton State College.
Mr. Florio's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency.
Pasquale Pignatelli, an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band, speaks sadly of Mr. Florio.
"I am a devout Catholic," says *T*-1 Mr. Pignatelli, a 40 - year - old health officer.
"I can't support him because of abortion."
Bill Wames Sr., 72, is Catholic too, but unfazed by Mr. Florio's stand on abortion.
*PRO*-1 A security guard at a cargo terminal, he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating "The US 1 Band."
"I still think 0 the woman has the right *PRO* to do with her body as she pleases," he says *T*-1.
"If you want more opinions *PRO* ask my wife.
She has lots of opinions.
The "seismic" activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth.
When things are quiet *T*-1 (low volatility), the structures on which markets stand *T*-2 can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately.
However, when powerful forces start *-2 shaking the market's structure *T*-1, the more "earthquake - resistant" it is *?*, the better its chance for survival.
America's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required * *PRO* to make them fully "aftershock - resistant."
Investors lack equal access to the markets' trading arena and its information.
That structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity.
And liquidity is what markets need *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to damp quakes and aftershocks.
In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and "upstairs" market makers (in the over - the - counter market) are the only market participants allowed *PRO* to play a direct role in the price - determination process.
When they halt trading *T*-2, all market liquidity is gone.
And when any component of the market--cash, futures or options--loses liquidity *T*-4, the price discovery system (the way 0 prices are determined *-2 *T*-3) becomes flawed or is lost *-1 entirely for a time.
Last Friday the 13th (as well as two years ago this week) the markets became unlinked.
When that happened *T*-1, "seismic" tremors of fear--much like the shock waves created * by an earthquake--coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility.
Lack of important, needed information can cause fear.
Fear is the father of panic.
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior.
And in financial markets, irrational behavior is sometimes translated *-1 into catastrophe.
When market tremors start *T*-2, it *EXP*-3 is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply - demand curve (*PRO* buy and sell orders at various prices) be made *-1 available to all, not just to market makers.
Because of a lack of information and access, many investors--including the very ones whose buying power *T*-2 could restore stability and damp volatility--are forced *-3 *PRO*-5 to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed *-1 *T*-4, because of their ignorance of important market information.
*PRO* To add aftershock - damping power to America's markets, a modern, electronic trading system *ICH*-1 should be implemented *-2 that *T*-4 permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that *T*-3 would automatically accompany such access) by investors--particularly institutional investors.
Contrary to some opinions, the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole.
What market makers provide *T*-1 is immediacy, a very valuable service.
Liquidity is not a service.
It is a market attribute--the ability *PRO* to absorb selling orders without *PRO*-1 causing significant price changes in the absence of news.
Market makers buy what investors wish *PRO*-2 to sell *T*-1; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors, and at a profit.
As a result, while any one customer may purchase immediacy by *PRO*-2 selling to a market maker (which *T*-1 is micro-liquidity for the investor), the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances 0 it was *T*-3 before the transaction: The unwanted position is still an unwanted position; only the identity of the seller has changed.
In fact it *EXP*-2 can be argued *-3 that *PRO* increasing capital commitments by market makers (a result of some post-1987 crash studies) also increases market volatility, since the more securities are held *-1 by market makers at any given time, the more selling pressure is overhanging the market.
In an open electronic system, any investor wishing *PRO* to pay for real - time access to the trading arena through a registered broker - dealer would be able *PRO*-1 to see the entire supply - demand curve (*PRO* buy and sell orders at each price) entered * by dealers and investors alike, and to enter and execute orders.
Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants--not just those of intermediaries who *T*-1 become extremely risk - averse during times of crisis.
Investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field 0 Congress sought *T*-1 and called *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a "national market system" (not yet achieved *) almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 *T*-2.
Last Friday's market gyrations did not result in severe "aftershocks."
Were we smart or just lucky?
I'm not certain.
But I am sure 0 we need *-1 to maximize our "earthquake" protection by *PRO*-2 making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock - damping power to our nation's markets.
Mr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood, N.J.
Chase Manhattan Corp., after *PRO*-1 trying unsuccessfully *PRO*-2 to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building, has exercised its option *PRO* to purchase the 50 - story office tower.
Chase had purchased an option *PRO* to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970.
The current transaction cost the bank approximately $140 million *U*.
Of that amount, $20 million *U* *T*-1 was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest *T*-1 was for the building itself.
The building houses about 4,500 Chase workers, most of whom *T*-3 will be moved *-1 to downtown Brooklyn after the bank's new back office center is completed *-2 in 1993.
The move is part of Chase's strategy *PRO* to consolidate its back offices under one roof.
The headquarters is located *-1 a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza.
As part of its decision *PRO* to leave the building, Chase tried *PRO*-1 to sell its interest, along with the Atlas estate's interest, shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash.
Chase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said 0 the bank decided *PRO*-1 to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations.
He said 0 Chase and the Atlas estate were looking *PRO*-1 to sell the entire building for $400 million to $475 million *U*, but didn't get an offer for more than $375 million *U*.
As the building's new owner, Chase will have its work cut out for it.
Chase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space, and Salomon Brothers Inc., whose headquarters *T*-1 is in the building, also plans *PRO*-2 to move shortly.
In addition, another major building tenant, Thomson McKinnon Inc.'s Thomson McKinnon Securities, likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation.
New York real estate brokerage Edward S. Gordon Co. will have the difficult task of *PRO* finding new tenants.
Even with its striking views of the New York harbor, the building is considered *-1 antiquated by modern office standards.
And Chase will have *-1 to spend approximately $50 million *U* *PRO*-2 to remove asbestos from the premises.
When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized * *PRO* to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy *T*-1, will he be able *PRO*-2 to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco?
Undoubtedly Mr. Bush will be praised *-1 by some Latin leaders prone *PRO* to pay lip service to nonintervention, while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action 0 *T*-2 to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught.
The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg.
It originates in a Bush administration decision *PRO* not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid, at all costs, *PRO*-2 being accused *-1 of *PRO*-3 meddling in the region.
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership, which *T*-1 leaves Central America *PRO*-2 open to Soviet adventurism.
"The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt *-2 in Central America; Washington's decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced *-1 from reality," says *T*-3 Fernando Volio, a Costa Rican congressman and former foreign minister.
The disarray of the Bush administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure *ICH*-1 of the Organization of American States *PRO* to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega.
*PRO*-2 Faced *-3 with this embarrassment, U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations, which *T*-1 gathered last week in Peru, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator.
But other than a few slaps on the wrist, Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body, too; he was not even singled out *-1 in the closing statement.
Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega, eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president.
The host, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, did not invite Chile, Cuba, Panama or Haiti to the summit, which *T*-2 was *-3 to be restricted *-1 to democracies.
However, Mr. Ortega was included *-1.
*PRO* Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized * in the Costa Rican press.
Even Carlos Manuel Castillo--the presidential candidate for Mr. Arias's National Liberation Party--made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua "in a democratic festivity."
Nevertheless, the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July, a few weeks before the Central American presidents met in Tela, Honduras, *PRO*-1 to discuss a timetable for *PRO* disbanding the anti-Sandinista rebels.
According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by *PRO*-2 pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support 0 *PRO* to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested *-1 next February *T*-3.
However, *PRO* relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in *PRO* delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business.
And even some last - minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made *T*-1 (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) *PRO*-2 to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed *-3 to stop the march of Mr. Arias's agenda.
Prior to this episode, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), *PRO*-1 sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America 0 *PRO* to promote an early disbanding of the rebels *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Visiting Nicaragua, he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for *PRO*-2 not rewarding the Sandinistas.
In Honduras, where the Contras are a hot political issue *T*-3, he promised *PRO*-1 to help unblock some $70 million *U* in assistance withheld * due to the failure *ICH*-2 of local agencies *PRO* to comply with conditions agreed upon * with Washington.
Aid was also the gist of the talks 0 Sen. Dodd had *T*-1 with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani; Mr. Cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd's likes and dislikes.
It *EXP*-1 was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S., virtually neglected * by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled *-2 by December, long before the elections.
Fittingly, the Tela Accords were nicknamed *-1 *PRO*-3 *ICH*-2 by Hondurans "the Dodd plan."
The individual foreign policy carried out * by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that *T*-1 has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America.
On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua *PRO*-1 to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts."
There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized *PRO*-1 to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America.
He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors *PRO*-1 to accept a "military equilibrium" guaranteed * by both superpowers.
The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue *-1 to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near - record levels.
Since Mr. Shevardnadze's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker, speculations *ICH*-1 arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America.
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan, which *T*-1 declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided * by Washington to freely elected governments.
Furthermore, it is also likely *-1 to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas.
The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted *-1 by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica.
In 1984, the Costa Rican government requested help *PRO* to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded * by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda.
*PRO* Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica, funded * by the U.S. and affiliated * with the Voice of America (VOA).
A few months ago, the Bush administration decided *PRO*-1 to stop this cooperation, *PRO* leaving Radio Costa Rica *PRO*-2 operating on a shoestring.
According to news reports, the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process.
In the meantime, Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which *T*-2 has been installed *-1 in the city of Esteli.
It is capable of *PRO*-1 reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America.
Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created *-1 in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default.
The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica, a peaceful democracy without an army.
*PRO*-3 Questioned *-2 in Washington about what *T*-1 would happen if his much - heralded peace plan would fail, President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action.
A poll conducted * in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked *-1 by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense.
But in the light of events in Panama, where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests *T*-1, *PRO* waiting for the Delta Force may prove *PRO*-2 to be a dangerous gambit.

Italy's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2% in June from a year earlier, the state statistical institute Istat said 0 *T*-1.
The June increase compared with a rise of 10.5% in May from a year earlier.
Domestic wholesale sales rose 11.9% from a year earlier, while foreign sales jumped 17.3%, Istat said 0 *T*-1.
For the first six months, wholesale sales rose 12.3% from the year before, *PRO* reflecting to a 11.5% jump in domestic sales and a 14.6% boost in foreign sales.
Sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6% in the January - June period from a year earlier.
Sales of consumer goods rose 6.9% in the same period, while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8% from a year ago.
Investors who *T*-2 received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s latest stock commentary may be left *-1 with blank expressions.
The first 10 pages of the 76 - page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank, except for the page numbers.
Rather than printing devils, Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market.
The plunge made Shearson's market commentary instantly out of date.
In fact, last Friday's 190.58 - point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise, not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that *T*-2 print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week.
Shearson, a 62% - owned unit of American Express Co., didn't have enough time 0 *PRO* to update its market commentary *T*-1 so, "We decided *PRO*-2 to kill our strategy pieces," says *T*-3 Jack Rivkin, the head of Shearson's research department.
The first thought 0 some investors had *T*-1 was that a red - faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary, and that's why it purged its pages *T*-2.
Investors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that "the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance."
Many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views.
But Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages weren't pulled *-1 because they were too bullish.
Instead, he says 0 *?*, "they were cautious, and that wasn't the message 0 we wanted *PRO* to deliver *T*-2" on Monday.
As Mr. Rivkin explains it, "We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market.
And by late Friday afternoon, actually after the close, we decided 0 that was the wrong tone 0 *PRO* to take *T*-1.
With the market down, we wanted *PRO*-1 to tell people *PRO*-2 to put their orders in on the opening."
Both before and after the Friday plunge, Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65% stocks, 20% bonds and 15% cash.
Senate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital - gains tax have decided, under pressure from their leaders, *PRO*-1 not to offer their own proposal, *PRO*-1 placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush's legislative priority.
A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes *PRO*-1 to develop a proposal *PRO* to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets.
The plan was complete except for finishing touches, and there was talk that it would be unveiled *-1 as early as yesterday.
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), a vigorous opponent of the capital - gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.
Sen. Mitchell urged them *PRO*-1 to desist.
Afterward, leaders of the dissident Democrats relented, and said 0 they wouldn't offer their own proposal as they had planned.
The decision is a setback for President Bush, who *T*-1 needs the support of Democrats *PRO*-2 to pass the tax cut through the Democratic - controlled Senate.
*PRO* Having a proposal sponsored * by Democrats would have given the president an advantage.
*PRO* Having only a Republican measure makes the task harder.
Still, Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the Republican capital - gains amendment, predicted that the tax cut would be enacted *-1 this year.
He said 0 a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators 0 *T*-1 to overcome any procedural hurdle 0 the Democratic leadership might erect *T*-2.
But Sen. Mitchell, buoyed * by his victory among fellow Democrats, strongly disagreed.
Mr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president's initiative would fail this year.
Yesterday, in an interview, he added that the Democrats' decision "increases the likelihood that a capital - gains tax cut will not pass this year."
Mr. Mitchell's first victory came last week, when the Senate passed a deficit - reduction bill that *T*-1 didn't contain a capital - gains provision *T*-2.
That vote made it *EXP*-3 unlikely that a capital - gains tax cut would be included *-1 in the final bill, now being drafted * by House and Senate negotiators.
The House version of the bill does include the tax cut.
Now Republican leaders are concentrating on *PRO*-2 attaching a capital - gains amendment to some other bill, perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that *T*-1 would follow on the heels of the deficit - reduction legislation.
*PRO*-2 To help *PRO*-3 lay the groundwork for that fight, President Bush plans *PRO*-2 early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who *T*-1 favor *PRO* cutting the capital - gains tax or are undecided on the issue.
The president apparently will have only one bill 0 *PRO* to push *T*-1, Sen. Packwood's, and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan *PRO*-2 to support it.
"I may want *PRO*-1 to offer additional amendments 0 *T*-2 to improve it when the bill comes to the floor *T*-3," said *T*-4 Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a leader of those Democrats.
The Packwood plan, as *PRO* expected, would allow individuals to exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held * for more than one year.
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year 0 the asset was held *-1 *T*-2, until it reached a maximum of 35% after seven years.
The exclusion would apply to assets sold * after Oct. 1.
As an alternative, taxpayers could chose *PRO*-1 to reduce their gains by an inflation index.
For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held * for more than three years would be cut *-1 to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held * for 15 years.
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal, designed * by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that *T*-1 would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.
The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn *-1 *T*-2 *PRO*-3 tax - free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses.
Current IRAs could be rolled *-1 over into the new IRAs, but would be subject to tax though no penalty.
When it comes to *PRO* buying and selling shares *T*-1, Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one.
Every dollar's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager's portfolio is traded *-1 seven or eight times a year, the firm estimates 0 *T*-2.
That makes it the most active trader among all the nation's investment advisers, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
But *PRO* wait a second.
Westridge Capital is an index fund--the type of stolid long - term investor whose goal *T*-1 is *PRO* to be nothing more than average.
Westridge Capital's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing.
Indexing for the most part has involved *PRO*-2 simply buying *RNR*-1 and then holding *RNR*-1 stocks in the correct mix *PRO* to mirror a stock market barometer, such as Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index, and match its performance.
Institutional investors have poured $210 billion *U* into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that *T*-1 promises *PRO*-2 to post average market returns.
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able *PRO*-1 to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it.
And the fees 0 investors pay *T*-1 for indexing run a few pennies for each $100 *U* of assets--a fraction of the cost of active managers.
That's because computers do most of the work, and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs.
But today, indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one.
Because index - fund managers are no longer satisfied with *PRO* merely being average, they have developed "enhanced" indexing strategies that *T*-1 are intended *-2 to outperform the market as much as three percentage points.
"Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there," says *T*-1 Seth M. Lynn, president of Axe Core Investors Inc., an indexer based * in Tarrytown, N.Y.
"Now the interest is in what else can I do *T*-1 with that money."
Among the souped - up indexing strategies: Indexed portfolios can be built *-1 around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than *PRO*-1 being restricted *-2 to the S&P 500 companies.
They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks, such as smaller companies, those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry, state or country.
With today's computer - driven program trading techniques, index funds can trade back and forth between stock - index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500.
Futures and options also make it *EXP*-3 possible *PRO* to build "synthetic" index funds that *T*-1 don't actually own a single share of stock, but can produce returns that *T*-2 match or exceed the broad stock market.
One reason for these hybrids is that indexing's rapid growth is slowing, particularly for those "plain vanilla" funds that *T*-1 mirror the S&P 500.
"There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there *PRO*-1 still waiting *PRO*-4 to get into indexing," says *T*-3 P. James Kartalia, vice president of ANB Investment Management Co., Chicago, which *T*-2 offers both indexing and active management services.
(After *PRO* tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned * by pension funds.)
A further problem is razor - thin profits.
Plain - vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees 0 they can charge *T*-1 have plunged to almost nothing, and in some cases are just that.
*PRO*-1 To land customers for their well - paying stock custodial business, big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free.
"It's like *PRO* getting a free toaster when you open an account *T*-2," says *T*-1 Axe Core's Mr. Lynn.
As a result, indexers have been looking for ways 0 *PRO* to give investors something more than the average for their money *T*-1.
And many have been successful, as in the case of the index fund operated * by hyper-trader Westridge Capital.
Westridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques *PRO*-1 to beat the S&P 500's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years, with the same risk level as *PRO* holding the S&P 500 stocks, according to James Carder, the firm's president.
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital, which *T*-1 has $300 million *U* under management.
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks *T*-1, and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock - index futures *PRO*-2 to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies.
Mr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options *PRO*-2 to boost returns and protect against declines *T*-1.
And in some months, he buys stock - index futures and not stocks at all.
"By their nature, our trades are very short - term and are going *-1 to create high turnover," Mr. Carder adds *T*-2.
"The more turnover, the better for our clients."
Big indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average *T*-1 has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund's returns.
J. Thomas Allen, president of Pittsburgh - based Advanced Investment Management Inc., agrees 0 it *EXP*-1's a good idea *PRO* to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures.
"You're buying the S&P, and you always want *PRO*-2 to hold the cheapest form of it," he says *T*-1.
But some indexers make little or no use of futures, *PRO*-1 saying that these instruments present added risks for investors.
"If the futures markets have a problem, then those products could have a problem," says *T*-1 John Zumbrunn, managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit.
Prudential currently is seeking approval *PRO* to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5/100 of a percentage point.
An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed *-1 by Prudential.
There are many other strategies 0 *T*-1 to bolster the returns of index funds.
They include:
LIMITED RISK FUNDS:
These guarantee protection against stock market declines while *PRO*-1 still passing along most gains.
Here a fund may promise *PRO*-1 to pay back, say, $95 *U* of every $100 *U* invested * for a year, even if the market goes much lower.
The fund could invest $87 *U* for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8% *PRO*-1 to return the guaranteed $95 *U*.
That leaves $13 *U*, which *T*-1 could be used *-3 *PRO* to buy S&P 500 options that *T*-2 will nearly match any gain in the S&P index.
MANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS:
*PRO* Say 0 a big investor is interested in growth stocks.
Instead of *PRO*-2 hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks, indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks; the portfolio will be maintained *-1 by computer, *PRO* reducing both fees and, in theory, risk (because of the large number of stocks).
"We see a lot of interest in those kind of things," says *T*-1 Frank Salerno, a vice president of Bankers Trust.
"People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies."
TILT FUNDS:
This is an index fund with a bet.
Instead of *PRO*-2 replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly, some stocks are overweighted or underweighted *-2 in the portfolio.
One simple approach is *PRO* to exclude S&P 500 companies considered *PRO* bankruptcy candidates; this can avoid weak sisters, but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds *T*-1.
Another approach: An investor with $100 million *U* might use $75 million *U* *PRO*-1 to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $25 million *U* on a favorite group of stocks.
SPECIALIZED FUNDS:
Indexes can be constructed *-1 0 *T*-2 to serve social goals, such as *PRO* eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa.
Other funds have been designed *PRO*-1 to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order *PRO* to encourage local investment.
Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System, for example, has about $130 million *U* invested * in a fund of 244 companies that *T*-1 are either Pennsylvania - based or have 25% of their work forces in the state.
Business and civic operations lurched back toward normalcy here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to earthquake - ravaged California would total at least $2.5 billion *U*.
"That is a minimum figure, and I underscore minimum," said *T*-1 House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash .) after *PRO*-2 conferring with California lawmakers.
"It *EXP*-1's impossible *PRO* to put an exact figure on it at this time."
The Office of Management and Budget has begun *-1 looking into legislation 0 *T*-2 to provide more funds for earthquake repairs.
And California's 45 - member delegation in the House is expected *-2 to propose that emergency funds be added *-1 to a stop - gap spending bill that the House Appropriations Committee is *-4 to consider *T*-3 Monday.
For the most part, major corporations' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday's earthquake, which *T*-1 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley 0 *T*-1 to report in, Seagate Technology, said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to be back at full strength Monday.
The day before the quake, Seagate completed three days of emergency training and drills.
*PRO*-1 Echoing the response of almost all big corporations in the Bay Area, Don Waite, Seagate's chief financial officer, said, "I wouldn't expect this to have any significant financial impact."
The city's recovery from the earthquake was uneven.
Banks indicated 0 they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said 0 tourists had fled, *PRO*-1 leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate.
City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled *-1 *T*-2.
Among the city's banks, Bank of America said 0 all but eight of its 850 branches were open.
The closed branches, in San Francisco, Hayward, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, sustained structural damage.
Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated - teller machines *PRO*-1 off - line.
Securities - trading operations were moved *-1 to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign - exchange trading operations were shifted *-2 to Los Angeles, the bank said 0 *T*-3.
Wells Fargo & Co. said 0 its Emergency Operations Committee--which *T*-1 met all night Tuesday--moved its global - funds transfer system to El Monte, Calif., 500 miles to the south.
Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated - teller machines remained out of order.
The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of San Francisco.
Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $600 million *U*.
Santa Clara County has a running total *ICH*-1 so far of $504 million *U*, excluding the hard - hit city of Los Gatos.
Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I - 880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in Oakland, *PRO* causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake.
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $2 billion *U*.
That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that *T*-3 must be demolished *-1, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer Richmond district that *T*-4 were heaved *-2 off their foundations.
Many streets and sidewalks buckled, and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured.
The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration, according to Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif .).
FEMA, which *T*-2 coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of *PRO* cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which *T*-3 hit the Carolinas last month.
It is likely *-2 to get as much as $800 million *U* *ICH*-1 initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion *U*, according to Mr. Fazio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 0 there is enough money on hand 0 *T*-1 to deal with immediate requirements.
The Bush administration has at its disposal $273 million *U* in funds remaining from the $1.1 billion *U* 0 Congress released *T*-1 for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo.
"We feel 0 we have the money necessary *PRO* to handle the immediate, short - term requirements," Mr. Fitzwater said *T*-1.
He added that the Office of Management and Budget, the Transportation Department and other agencies are "developing longer - term legislation" that *T*-1 should be ready soon.
Much of the cost of *PRO* cleaning up after the earthquake will involve *PRO*-1 repairing highways and bridges.
California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made *-1 available for the state.
Some things can't be repaired *-1.
The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $10 million to $15 million *U* in damage, including shattered porcelains and stone figures.
Its neighbor, the De Young Museum, totaled $3 million to $5 million *U* in structural damage and shattered sculpture.
The city's main library is closed *-1 because of fissures that *T*-2 opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor.
The ground along the Embarcadero the street that *T*-1 skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers--dropped six inches after the quake, *PRO* wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.
At San Francisco International Airport, shock waves wrecked the control tower, *PRO*-1 knocking down computers and shattering glass.
Offices of the city's Rent Board were destroyed *-1.
Mayor Agnos's $2 billion *U* estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which *T*-1 remained closed.
A major chunk of the $2 billion *U* is expected *-1 to be eaten up *-2 by overtime for city workers deployed * in the emergency, said 0 *T*-3 a spokesman for Mr. Agnos.
"All of the city's $5.9 million *U* emergency reserve was spent *-2 in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said 0 *T*-1.
Insurers struggled to *PRO*-1 to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices.
At Fireman's Fund Corp., a spokesman said 0 142 claims were received *-1 in the first 24 hours after the quake, and the company is braced *-2 for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential *RNR*-3 and 35,000 business *RNR*-3 policyholders in the affected area.
"Claims range from a scratched fender--and there were an awful lot of cars damaged * in this--to a major processing plant," a spokesman said *T*-1.
"We're delivering a check for $750,000 *U* to an automotive business in Berkeley that *T*-1 burned on Tuesday."
Fireman's is part of a $38 million *U* syndicate that *T*-3 supplies business interruption insurance *ICH*-1 *PPA*-2 to the city *PPA*-2 on the Bay Bridge, which *T*-4 must pay employees during the three weeks or more 0 it is expected *-6 to be out of service and deprived *-7 of toll income *T*-5.
California lawmakers want *PRO*-1 to eliminate temporarily a $100 million *U* cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on *PRO* using the emergency highway aid *PRO* to repair toll roads.
In addition, under the highway - relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.
After that, the federal share diminishes.
For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have *-1 to pick up the remainder of the cost.
But lawmakers want *PRO*-1 to extend the period for 100% federal funding for several months.
Those changes also would apply to two areas hit * hard by Hurricane Hugo--South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to an aide to Rep. Fazio.
Meanwhile, the FEMA announced a toll - free telephone number (800-462-9029) 0 *T*-1 to expedite service to victims of the earthquake.
Lines *ICH*-2 will be available 24 hours a day 0 *T*-1 to take applications for such disaster relief as temporary housing and emergency home repairs by phone.
Transportation officials are expecting utter traffic pandemonium beginning Monday and growing worse over the next several weeks.
Some 250,000 cars normally cross the closed Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco daily.
Officials say 0 it *EXP*-1 is clear that alternate routes can't handle the overflow.
The state is calling in a flotilla of navy landing vessels and other boats 0 *T*-1 to expand ferry service across the bay and hopes *PRO*-2 to add numerous new bus routes and train departures *PRO*-2 to help alleviate the traffic problem.
Moreover, state officials are urging freight haulers *PRO*-1 to bypass many of the area's main highways and to travel late at night or during predawn hours.
Even so, "We're looking for chaos," said 0 *T*-1 George Gray, a deputy district director at the California Department of Transportation.
"If there's any way 0 you can do it *T*-2, you ought *PRO*-1 to go to Idaho and go fishing for a while."
Most of San Francisco's tourists and business travelers already have left--despite hotel's offers of rate cuts.
"Everyone left," said *T*-1 Peter Lang, reservations manager of the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
The Westin St. Francis hotel, which *T*-1 survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, currently is less than 50% occupied.
"We still have our die - hard baseball fans," a spokesman said *T*-1.
"One lady from New York said 0 she's not going home until the {World Series} is over."

After years of *PRO* quarreling over Bonn's "Ostpolitik", West Germany and the U.S. appear *-1 to have shifted onto a united course in Eastern Europe.
Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, *PRO*-1 pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while *PRO*-2 urging other industrial nations *PRO*-3 to follow suit.
Both hope *PRO*-1 to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled * by Stalinist holdouts by *PRO*-2 arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland, Hungary and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union.
West German officials also have the special goal of *PRO* holding out hope for East Germany's fledgling reform movement.
"The change taking place in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary has aroused new hope *ICH*-2 in both German states that reforms will be undertaken *-1 in {East Germany}, and that relations between the two German states, too, will get better," said *T*-3 Foreign Minister Hans - Dietrich Genscher.
*PRO*-2 Addressing a conference of the New York - based Institute for East - West Security Studies in Frankfurt yesterday, Mr. Genscher said, "History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that *T*-1 emerge from these reforms."
The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms, he said 0 *?*, is *PRO* to create "an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals."
Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland.
Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland's request for a $1 billion *U* stand - by credit from the International Monetary Fund.
"We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed.
We are prepared *PRO*-1 to support those changes," said *T*-2 Mr. Mosbacher.
U.S. curbs on the exports of sensitive technology to East bloc countries will remain in place, however.
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $837.5 million *U* aid package for Poland and Hungary that *T*-1 more than doubles the amount 0 President Bush had requested *T*-2.
The package was brought *-1 to the House just 15 days after it was introduced *-2, *PRO* indicating Congress's eagerness *PRO* to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms.
The legislation, approved * 345 - 47 and sent * to the Senate, establishes two enterprise funds, 0 *T*-1 to be governed *-48 by independent nonprofit boards, which *T*-49 will make loans and investments in new business ventures in Hungary and Poland.
The Polish fund would be seeded *-1 with $160 million *U*, the Hungarian fund with $40 million *U*.
In addition, a group of 24 industrialized countries, including the U.S. and Japan and coordinated * by the European Community Commission, has promised Poland and Hungary trade advice and a line of credit equivalent to $1.11 billion *U* through the European Investment Bank, while the EC plans $222 million *U* in direct aid.
When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9 *T*-1, he is expected *-2 to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion *U*) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects.
Last week, Bonn agreed *PRO*-2 to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that *T*-1 came due last year.
In addition, a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is *-1 to be written off *-2.
Poland's plan *PRO* to switch to a free - market economy by 1991 is hampered *-1 by a foreign debt load of $39.2 billion *U*.
West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks as the emerging democratic state rushes through its own economic reforms, including a broad privatization of state - owned industry and tax incentives for industrial investment.
An additional 500 million marks in credit - backing was promised *-1 by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden - Wuerttemberg.
Deutsche Bank AG, which *T*-1 last year arranged a three billion mark credit for the Soviet Union, is now moving *PRO*-2 to become the first West German bank 0 *T*-3 to set up independent business offices in Hungary and Poland as they shift to free - market economies.
A maxim of Frankfurt banking holds that wherever Deutsche Bank goes *T*-1, other West German banks follow *T*-2.
Indeed, at least four other West German banks are believed *-1 to be making inquiries.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. was the underwriter.
Mercury Savings & Loan Association said 0 it retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its lead investment banker 0 *T*-1 to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the Huntington Beach, Calif., thrift.
Mercury, which *T*-2 has assets of more than $2 billion *U* and 24 branches in California, said 0 the action *PRO* to improve its regulatory capital position is related *-1 directly to new capital requirements mandated * by recently adopted federal legislation.
Mercury also said 0 it extended its two - year advisory relationship with Montgomery Securities of San Francisco.
Mercury's stock closed yesterday at $4.875 *U*, unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ever since the hotly contested America's Cup race last year, the famous yachting match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it.
Now that a key member of the San Diego Yacht Club team is splitting off *PRO*-1 to form his own team, even more competition lies ahead.
Peter Isler, the winning navigator in the past two America's Cup challenges, has split from the team led * by Dennis Conner, skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes, *PRO*-1 to form his own team for the next contest in 1992.
And, in addition to a crack team of sailors, Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass 0 *T*-1 to help him finance the syndicate.
Isler Sailing International's advisory board includes Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting chairman and a former Cup victor; Peter G. Diamandis, head of Diamandis Communications, and Joseph B. Vittoria, chairman and chief executive of Avis Inc.
His steering committee includes other notable businessmen, including the California investor and old salt Roy E. Disney.
"We have the structure, people and plan," Mr. Isler said *T*-1 in a statement.
Now, the first order of business is *PRO* raising enough money 0 *T*-1 to keep his team *PRO*-2 afloat--a new yacht will cost about $3 million *U* alone, and sailing syndicate budgets can easily run to $25 million *U* for a Cup challenge.
The split comes in the midst of a court battle over whether the San Diego Yacht Club should be allowed *PRO*-1 to keep the international trophy for *PRO* sailing a catamaran against the New Zealand challengers' 90 - foot monohull.
In September, a New York appellate court overturned a state judge's ruling that *T*-1 awarded the Cup to the New Zealand team.
Pending an appeal by the New Zealand team, led * by Michael Fay, the finals for the next Cup challenge are scheduled *-2 to be held *-1 in mid-1992 in San Diego.
But because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit, Mr. Conner's team has done little 0 *PRO* to begin *-2 gearing up *PRO*-3 to defend its title *T*-1.
"If you don't know what the rules of the game are *T*-1, it *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to start your fund - raising or design," said *T*-3 Dana Smith, an official with Team Dennis Conner.
The Conner team won't be able *PRO*-3 to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved *-1 and the race site is determined *-2, Mr. Smith said 0 *T*-4, and the syndicate's budget could easily reach $30 million *U*.
But spokesmen for both Mr. Isler and Mr. Conner say 0 the formation of the new syndicate has *PRO* to do with Mr. Isler's desire *PRO* to skipper his own team and begin *-1 planning now, rather than any falling out between the two sportsmen.
Mr. Smith and a spokesman for the America's Cup Organizing Committee insist that the added competition for the defender's spot will only improve the race.
As the Hunt brothers' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year, Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal 0 *PRO* to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men *T*-1.
But the plan only threatens *PRO*-3 to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that *T*-2 were filed *-1 in September 1988.
The Peruvian mineral concern's $251 million *U* claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers' alleged attempts *PRO* to corner the 1979 - 80 silver market.
Minpeco now says 0 it is willing *PRO*-1 to settle for up to $65.7 million *U* from each brother, although the actual amount would probably be much less.
Although the proposal must be approved *-1 by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson, W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern's proposal.
Nelson Bunker Hunt is considering it, although his attorney says 0 he won't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement 0 he has reached *T*-2 with the Internal Revenue Service, which *T*-1 claims 0 the brothers owe $1 billion *U* in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases.
The tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval.
Under it, the former billionaire's assets would be liquidated *-1 with the IRS getting 80% of the proceeds and the rest being divided *-3 among other creditors, including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which *T*-2 is seeking repayment of a $36 million *U* loan.
A similiar proposal has been made *-1 in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt 0 he would have *-3 to pay *T*-2 to the government from future earnings.
In both cases, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie.
With support from the IRS, Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit *PRO*-1 asking Judge Abramson *PRO*-2 to subordinate Minpeco's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS.
Minpeco has threatened a "volcano" of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts *PRO*-1 to force such a plan through the court.
Minpeco said 0 it wouldn't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved *-1 by Judge Abramson, who *T*-2 will consider the proposal at a hearing next week.
Minpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover, called it "*PRO*-1 silly" and said 0 he would fight it in court.
"The thing is so fluid *ICH*-3 right now that there's really no way 0 *PRO* to say what *T*-1 will happen *T*-4," says *T*-5 Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III, who *T*-2 represents the IRS in the case.
"Developments like this are hard 0 *PRO* to predict *T*-1.
The Spanish author Camilo Jose Cela won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday, a surprising choice, but given the Swedish Academy's past perversities, hardly the most undeserved and ridiculous accolade handed * out by the awarding committee.
In Spain, anyway, the 73 - year - old Mr. Cela enjoys some renown for the novels and travel books 0 he wrote *T*-1 during the parched Franco years, the everyday poverty and stagnant atmosphere of which he described *T*-2 in brutally direct, vivid prose, *PRO*-3 beginning with "The Family of Pascal Duarte" (1942).
Unlike other writers who *T*-1 either battled the fascists during the Civil War, or left Spain when Franco triumphed *T*-2, Mr. Cela fought briefly on the general's side, no doubt *PRO*-4 earning with his war wound some forbearance when he went on *PRO*-3 to depict a country with a high population of vagabonds, murderers and rural idiots trudging aimlessly through a dried - out land *T*-5.
Still, it was in Argentine editions that his countrymen first read his story of Pascal Duarte, a field worker who *T*-1 stabbed his mother to death and has no regrets as he awaits his end in a prison cell *T*-4: "Fate directs some men down the flower - bordered path, and others down the road bordered * with thistles and prickly pears.
The lucky ones gaze out at life with serene eyes and smile with a face of innocence at their perfumed happiness.
The others endure the hot sun of the plains and scowl like cornered wild beasts."
Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones, his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades 0 he spent *T*-1 *PRO*-2 putting out some 70 travelogues, novels, short story collections and poetry.
These days, he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who *T*-2 shares his life as he is *?* for his books.
The man who *T*-1 wore out his shoes *PRO*-3 wandering around Guadalajara in 1958 *PPA*-4, *PRO*-3 describing in his travel book "Viaje a la Alcarria" how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns *T*-2, now tours Spain in a Rolls - Royce.
Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run * by Dona Rosa, a foul - mouthed, broad - based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted * in filth, used *-1 to be available in English, *PRO*-4 translated * by J.M. Cohen and published * by Ecco Press, which *T*-2 now no doubt regrets *PRO*-3 relinquishing its copyright.
Here is *T*-1 an excerpt:
The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez.
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard.
Both are young, one twenty odd, the other thirty odd.
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist.
It *EXP*-1 is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines: "I've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title ` Teresa de Cepeda,' and in it I've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which ..."
"Oh, yes.
Will you pour me a drop of water, if you don't mind?"
"With pleasure.
I've revised it several times and I think 0 I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text."
"How interesting."
"I think so.
I don't know the quality of the works 0 my colleagues have sent in *T*-1, but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment ..."
"*PRO* Rest *PRO*-1 assured, we proceed with exemplary fairness."
"I don't doubt it for a moment.
It does not matter if one is defeated *-1, provided 0 the work that *T*-2 gets the award has unmistakable qualities.
What *T*-1's so discouraging is ..."
In *PRO*-1 passing the window, Senorita Elvira gives them a smile--simply out of habit.
After *PRO*-1 watching interest in the sport plummet for years, the ski industry is trying *PRO*-1 to give itself a lift.
Across the country, resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical - music concerts *PRO*-1 to attract new customers.
Some have built health spas, business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 than ski.
And this week, the industry's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a $7 million *U* advertising campaign *T*-1.
Such efforts--unheard of only a few years ago--are the latest attempts *PRO* to revive the sagging $1.76 billion *U* U.S. ski industry.
Since the start of the decade, lift - ticket sales have grown only 3% a year on average, compared with 16% annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s.
Last season, lift - ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years.
By some estimates, nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to shut down since the early '80s.
Competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts.
But another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers.
Skiing, after all, has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities 0 *T*-1 to stick with the sport.
In its new ad campaign, created * by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc., Chicago, the ski industry is trying *PRO*-1 to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people.
One 60 - second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun - drenched slopes: senior citizens, minorities, families with children--even a blind skier.
"Ski school is great," cries out *T*-1 a tot, bundled * in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope.
"You'll never know 'til you try," says *T*-1 a black skier.
"We used *-2 to show some hot - dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff," says *T*-1 Kathe Dillmann, a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association, the trade group sponsoring the campaign.
Ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety.
But the new commercials deal with it indirectly by *PRO*-1 showing a woman smiling as she tries *PRO*-2 to get up from a fall.
"We wanted *PRO*-2 to show 0 it's okay if you fall," says *T*-1 Ms. Dillmann.
"Most people think 0 if you slip, you'll wind up in a body cast."
The ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers; normally, they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities.
But in these crunch times for the ski industry, some resorts, such as the Angel Fire, Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico, have even started *-1 shuttle - busing skiers to each other's slopes and next year plan *PRO*-1 to sell tickets good for all local lifts.
Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business.
Since 40% of skiers are parents, many slopes are building nurseries, expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids.
Vail, Colo., now has a playland that *T*-1 looks like an old mining town; kids can ski through and pan for fool's gold.
For $15 *U*, they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment, with dinner, without mom and dad.
A few years ago, parents usually had *-1 to hire a sitter or take turns *PRO*-2 skiing while one spouse stayed with the children.
"Most parents who *T*-1 had *-3 to go through that never came back," says *T*-4 Michael Shannon, president of Vail Associates Inc., which *T*-2 owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts.
*PRO*-2 To make skiing more convenient for time - strapped visitors, several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies.
In one phone call, ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations, buy lift tickets, rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons.
And resorts are adding other amenities, such as pricey restaurants, health spas and vacation packages with a twist.
During Winter Carnival week, for example, visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot - air balloon ride.
"People these days want something else 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 besides ski and sit in the bar," says *T*-2 Don Borgeson, executive director of Angel Fire, N.M.'s Chamber of Commerce.
The ski industry hopes *PRO*-1 to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions.
But some think 0 that's *PRO* being overly optimistic.
For one thing, it *EXP*-1 may be tough *PRO* to attract people because skiing is still expensive: a lift ticket can cost up to $35 *U* a day and equipment prices are rising.
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions.
An American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34% believe 0 their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports, as *PRO* opposed to 69% who *T*-3 think that warm - weather sports will be the deciding factor.
"Even if they could bring in that many new skiers, I don't know if {the industry} could handle that kind of an increase," says *T*-1 I. William Berry, editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah, N.Y.
"Most people will come on the weekend, the slopes will be overcrowded and then these {new skiers} won't come back.
Harley - Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here, *PRO*-2 alleging that a group that *T*-1 holds 6.2% of its stock made "false, deceptive and misleading" statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements.
Harley - Davidson's complaint claims that the group, led * by investor Malcolm I. Glazer, violated securities laws by *PRO*-2 failing *-3 to disclose plans *PRO* to purchase 15% of the company's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart - Scott - Rodino filing eventually was made *-1 *T*-4, it didn't disclose the group's alleged earlier violation of the so - called prior - notice requirements of the law.
Mr. Glazer couldn't immediately be reached *-1 *PRO*-1 to comment.
But when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group's filing procedures *T*-1, the Rochester, N.Y., investor said "we complied with every law," and he denied any wrongdoing.
The Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley - Davidson, or seek representation on the company's board.
Harley has said 0 it doesn't intend *PRO*-2 to be acquired *-1 by the Glazer group or any other party.
Raymond Chandler, in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book, likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher.
When the champ has lost his stuff *T*-1, the great mystery novelist wrote 0 *?*, "when he can no longer throw the high hard one *T*-3, he throws his heart instead.
He throws something.
He doesn't just walk off the mound and weep."
Chandler might have been predicting the course of his own career.
His last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe, the inferior "Playback" (1958), at times read almost like a parody of his previous work.
When he died in 1959 *T*-2, Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book, "The Poodle Springs Story," which *T*-1 seemed *-3 to go beyond parody into something like burlesque.
"Champ" Chandler's last pitch, apparently, was a screwball.
Now Robert Parker, author of several best sellers featuring Spenser, a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold, has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired *-1 *PRO*-2 to complete "The Poodle Springs Story."
The result, "Poodle Springs" (Putnam's, 288 pages, $18.95 *U*) is an entertaining, easy 0 *PRO* to read *T*-1 and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle, full of hard - boiled wisecracks and California color.
If it does not quite have Chandler's special magic--well, at the end, neither did Chandler *?*.
As the book begins, a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle (a.k.a . Palm) Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood.
His bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring, a character who *T*-1 also appeared in Chandler's "The Long Goodbye" and "Playback."
Philip and Linda move into her mansion and can't keep their hands off each other, even in front of the Hawaiian / Japanese houseman.
But the lovebirds have a conflict.
He wants *PRO*-1 to continue *-2 being a low - paid private eye, and she wants him to live off the million dollars 0 she's settled *T*-3 on him.
That's Chandler's setup.
Mr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life, Hollywood low life and various folk who *T*-1 hang their hats in both worlds.
The supporting lineup is solid, the patter is amusing and there's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls, the "good cop" of previous Chandler books who *T*-1 still doesn't hesitate *PRO*-2 to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes *T*-3.
The style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler's prose at its most pared down.
All told, Mr. Parker does a better job of *PRO* making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right *PRO* to expect.
But there are grounds for complaint.
At one point, the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in *PRO* catching on to a double identity scam--and Marlowe is supposed *-1 to be the pro.
More bothersome, there are several apparent anachronisms.
Contact lenses, tank tops, prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem *-1 out of place in the 1950s.
A little more care in *PRO* re-creating Marlowe's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable.

Millicom Inc. said 0 it is one of two companies 0 *T*-1 to receive a license *PRO* to introduce and operate a cellular mobile telephone system in Pakistan.
The market during the start - up is estimated *-1 at 25,000 subscribers.
A spokeswoman for Millicom, a telecommunications company, said 0 she didn't know the value of the contract.
Cable & Wireless PLC of Britain won the other license.
Millicom said 0 it would build and operate the system in Pakistan with Comvik International AB, part of the Kinnevik group of Sweden, and Arfeen International, Pakistan.
The 1986 tax overhaul, the biggest achievement of President Reagan's second term, is beginning *-1 to fall apart, and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill.
Real - estate executives are lobbying *PRO*-1 to ease anti-tax - shelter rules.
Charitable groups are trying *PRO*-2 to reinstate the write - off for contributions made * by individuals who *T*-1 don't itemize their deductions.
Big auction houses want *PRO*-1 to make collectibles eligible for lower capital - gains taxes.
And heavy - industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of *PRO* reinstating the investment tax credit.
"Everything is up for grabs," says *T*-1 Theodore Groom, a lobbyist for mutual life - insurance companies.
Adds *ICH*-2 Robert Juliano, the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses: "It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again."
The catalyst has been the congressional move *PRO* to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains, an effort that *T*-1 is likely *-2 to succeed in this Congress.
Other fundamental "reforms" of the 1986 act have been threatened *-1 as well.
The House seriously considered *PRO*-1 raising the top tax rate paid * by individuals with the highest incomes.
The Senate Finance Committee voted *PRO*-2 to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts, and also to bring back income averaging for farmers, a tax preference that *T*-1 allows income to be spread *-3 out over several years.
As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark .) calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 a "feeding frenzy" of special - interest legislating.
The beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo - rental shops.
*PRO* To be sure, the full Senate, *PRO*-3 facing a fast - approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that *T*-2 were contained *-1 in the Finance Committee bill.
But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary.
Other bills *ICH*-3 will be moving soon that *T*-2 are expected *-1 to carry many of the tax cuts, including both the capital - gains and IRA provisions.
"There isn't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given *-1 a mighty tug," says *T*-2 Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y .).
"You'll see the annual unraveling of it."
"It's back to tax - give - away time for the select few," says *T*-1 Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the third - ranking Democrat in the House.
*PRO*-1 Referring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax - writing committees, he adds, "Next year, every special - interest group is going *-2 to be there *PRO*-3 knocking on Lloyd Bentsen's door, on Danny Rostenkowski's door."
Many groups aren't waiting that long.
Just last week, a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting *PRO*-2 to hear the pleas of individual cities, companies and interest groups who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to open their own special loopholes.
"It's a Swiss - cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good," commented *T*-2 one veteran lobbyist who *T*-1 was watching the proceedings.
Even lobbyists for heavy industry, one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill, are encouraged *-1.
The return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs "creates more of a mood or a mindset that *T*-1 is helpful for *PRO* getting better depreciation (write - offs) or investment credits," says 0 *T*-2 Paul Huard, a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers.
Corporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference 0 *PRO* to discuss what tax changes *PRO* to make *T*-1 *PRO* to improve "competitiveness *T*-2."
In reaction to proposed capital - gains legislation, groups are lobbying *PRO*-2 to make sure 0 they aren't left *-1 off the gravy train.
Real - estate interests, for example, are protesting an omission in President Bush's capital - gains proposal: It doesn't include real - estate gains.
"If there is going *-2 to be a tax scheme that *T*-1 contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want *PRO*-3 to be part of it," says *T*-4 real - estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates.
In the House - passed tax bill, Mr. Thevenot got his wish; real - estate assets are included *-1 in the capital - gains provision.
But Sotheby's, Christie's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying *PRO*-1 to get theirs.
They have sent a letter to congressional tax - writers *PRO*-2 asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given *-1 preferential treatment.
"Collectibles should continue *-3 to be recognized *-1 as capital assets," the letter states *T*-2.
All of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
In exchange for dramatically lower tax rates, the framers of that legislation sought *PRO*-2 to eliminate most of the exemptions, deductions and credits that *T*-1 gave some taxpayers an advantage over others.
The goal was *PRO* to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally, and to eliminate the many shelters that *T*-1 allowed the wealthy to escape taxes.
Two of the major ways that tax - writers managed *PRO*-3 to attain these ends *T*-2 were *PRO* to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses, also known * as passive losses, that *T*-1 made many tax shelters possible.
Many other tax benefits also were swept *-1 away.
This year Congress, with prodding from President Bush, has been busy *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code.
It appears *-2 likely that, this year or next, some form of capital - gains preference and passive - loss restoration will be enacted *-1.
Other tax benefits probably will be restored and created *-1.
The main obstacle is finding a way 0 *PRO* to pay for them *T*-1.
"The '86 act was a fluke.
They wanted reform and they got a revolution," says *T*-1 overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison (R., Ohio).
So, is the tax code now open game again?
Mr. Juliano thinks so.
One recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol *PRO*-1 monitoring tax - and - budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund - raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School.
"I'm too old 0 *T*-1 to waste a weekend, but that's what I did *T*-2," the 48 - year - old Mr. Juliano moans *T*-3.
"These days, anything can happen.
Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that *T*-1 hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century.
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.
Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%.
As we know, voters tend *-1 to favor Republicans more *ICH*-2 in races for president than in those for Congress.
In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major - party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.
Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite.
What *T*-1 accounts for the results of recent decades?
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed * by Americans in the voting booth.
The theory relies on three assumptions:
1) Voters can "buy" one of two brands *ICH*-1 when they select their political agents *T*-4--a Republican brand that *T*-2 believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that *T*-3 believes in big government and in public intervention *PRO* to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest.
2) Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities *ICH*-2 while *PRO*-1 voting in office--*PRO* dealing with national issues (programmatic actions such as *PRO* casting roll call votes on legislation that *T*-3 imposes costs and / or confers benefits on the population at large) and attending to local issues (constituency service and pork barrel).
3) Republican congressional representatives, because of their belief in a minimalist state, are less willing *PRO*-1 to engage in local benefit - seeking than are Democratic members of Congress.
If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what *T*-2 in economic theory is called *-1 *PRO*-4 a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive *ICH*-3, at the margin, *PRO* to lean Democratic.
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless *PRO*-2 to prevent other legislators from "*PRO*-1 bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies.
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making *T*-1.
In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is *PRO* to lean Republican.
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district / state, such a president is also likely *-1 to be more effective at *PRO* preventing other districts / states and their legislators from *PRO*-2 bringing home the local benefits.
The individual voter's standing consequently will be enhanced *-1 through lower taxes.
While this theory is exceedingly simple, it appears *-1 to explain several things.
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has *?* *T*-1 over the past half century *T*-2: Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe.
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives *T*-2: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins *T*-1 for them but not the overall cost associated * with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency.
Third, the theory suggests why legislators who *T*-1 pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit - seeking have lower security in office *T*-2.
For example, first - term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought * into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role--*PRO* spreading the Reagan revolution--in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat.
Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time *PRO* attracting viable candidates for congressional office *T*-1.
Potential candidates may be discouraged *-1 from *PRO*-2 running less *ICH*-3 by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.
To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered *-1 in its attempts *PRO* to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates.
Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced *-1 in the South *T*-2.
To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able *PRO*-2 to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive *PRO* to keep such Democrats in office.
Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better *ICH*-2 in Senate races than in campaigns for the House *T*-1.
Since local benefit - seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern 0 one would expect *T*-1 if Republicans are less willing *PRO*-2 to engage in local benefit - seeking than their Democratic counterparts.
Is there any empirical support for this theory?
Three pieces of evidence corroborate the key assumption that Democratic legislators are more willing *PRO*-1 to engage in local benefit - seeking than their Republican colleagues.
First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.
To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit - seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans *PRO*-1 to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns.
Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll - call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that *PRO* participating in such votes takes away from the time 0 a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit - seeking *T*-1.
This is indeed what the data indicate *T*-1, particularly in the case of the House.
The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959.
Finally, as *PRO* shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices--where local benefit - seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices *T*-1.
An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands *T*-2), moreover, reveals that the personal staffing differences noted * in the table cannot be attributed *-1 to the disproportionate control 0 Democrats exercise *T*-3, due to their majority - party status, over other resources such as committee staff.
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: *PRO* Holding other factors *ICH*-1 constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out *-2 to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is *T*-3 per state (a progressive tax rate hits higher - income states harder).
*PRO* Put *-2 more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on *-1 more kindly *ICH*-3 by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe *T*-4.
Moreover, ticket splitting appears *-1 to take the same peculiar pattern *ICH*-2 at the state government level as it does at the federal level.
State government is more typically *ICH*-2 split *-1 along Republican - governor / Democratic - legislature lines than the reverse.
A cross-state econometric investigation, furthermore, reveals that, *PRO* holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major - party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate.
In sum, at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior 0 voters display *T*-1 in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation.

After *PRO*-1 slipping on news of a smaller - than - *PRO* expected *-2 U.S. inflation figure, the dollar rebounded later in the trading day.
The U.S. unit dipped to a session low against the mark just after the release of the U.S. consumer price index.
The report showed that September consumer prices rose just 0.2%, a smaller increase than *PRO* expected *-1.
The market had anticipated a 0.4% rise in the price index.
The September index fueled speculation *ICH*-1, damaging to the dollar, that the Federal Reserve soon will ease monetary policy further.
But foreign - exchange dealers said 0 the dollar staged a quick comeback, *PRO*-1 prompted *-2 by a round of short covering and some fresh buying interest later in the trading day.
Traders said that a nearly 40 - point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fueled * in part by news of a lower - than - *PRO* expected *-1 price index, had little influence on the dollar's moves.
"The market is beginning *-1 to disassociate itself from Wall Street," said *T*-2 one New York trader.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8470 marks, down from 1.8485 marks late Wednesday, and at 141.70 yen, up from 141.45 yen late Wednesday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.5990 *U*, up from $1.5920 *U* late Wednesday.
In Tokyo Friday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.93 yen, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 141.55 yen.
Some analysts said 0 the consumer price index reflects a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy than *PRO* earlier indicated *-1.
They point out that September's producer - price index showed a 0.9% increase.
They noted that because the consumer price index, known * as the CPI, is a more comprehensive measure of inflation and is rising less rapidly than the producer - price index, or PPI, it could signal further easing by Fed.
Others suggested, however, that the Fed will hold any changes in monetary policy in check, *PRO* leaving fed funds at around 8 3/4%, down from the 9% level that *T*-1 prevailed from July through September.
Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corp., said that both PPI and CPI climbed around 4 1/2% year - to - year in September.
He argued that both CPI and PPI have in fact decelerated since spring.
"The Fed won't be stampeded *-3 into easing," Mr. Logan said *T*-1, *PRO*-4 predicting that for now, interest rates will stay where they are *T*-2.
A four - day matched sale - purchase agreement, a move *PRO* to drain liquidity from the system, was viewed *-1 as a technical move, rather than an indication of tightening credit.
Market participants note that the mark continues *-1 to post heftier gains against its U.S. counterpart than any other major currency, particularly the yen.
"There's a bottomless pit of dollar demand" by Japanese investors, said 0 *T*-1 Graham Beale, managing director of foreign exchange at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York, *PRO*-2 adding that purely speculative demand wouldn't hold the dollar at its recent levels against the Japanese currency.
Mr. Beale commented that the mark remains well bid against other currencies as well.
Robert White, manager of corporate trading at First Interstate of California, called the market "*PRO*-3 psychologically pro-mark," *PRO*-2 noting that the U.S. remains a "veritable grab bag" for Japanese investors which *T*-1 accounts for the unabated demand for U.S. dollars.

Coastal Corp. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement *ICH*-1 with Aruba *PRO* to restart a 150,000 - barrel - a - day oil refinery.
Coastal wouldn't disclose the terms.
Coastal, a Houston oil and gas company, said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to begin operations in October 1990.
The company said 0 it may install additional processing units at the refinery *PRO*-1 to produce higher octane gasolines and other products.
The company said 0 it was leasing the site of the refinery from Aruba.
Exxon Corp. built the plant but closed it in 1985 and sold off much of the equipment to dismantling contractors, from whom Coastal bought back much of the equipment *T*-1.
A Coastal spokesman said 0 the biggest expense will be *PRO* to refurbish the refinery but wouldn't say how much that would be *T*-1.
The prime minister of Aruba has said 0 it could cost around $100 million *U*.
Coastal said 0 the refinery's expected daily production will include 34,000 barrels of jet fuel, 32,000 barrels of low - sulfur diesel fuel, 30,000 barrels of naphtha, 17,000 barrels of residual fuel oil, 8,000 barrels of asphalt and 25,000 barrels of low - sulfur catalytic cracker feedstock.

Ford Motor Co.'s Merkur, the company's first new car franchise in the U.S. since the Edsel was unveiled *-1 in 1957, now will share Edsel's fate.
Ford said yesterday 0 it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio, a $28,000 *U* luxury sedan built * by Ford of Europe in West Germany.
The cars are sold *-1 under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln - Mercury dealers--as *PRO* opposed *-4 to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which *T*-3 are sold *-2 under existing Ford divisions.
The move *PRO* to halt imports--announced * 29 years and 11 months to the day after Henry Ford II declared that the Edsel division and its gawky car would be scrapped *-1--kills the four - year - old Merkur brand in the U.S. market.
It will continue *-2 to be sold *-1 in the European market.
Merkur's death isn't nearly as costly to Ford as was *?* the Edsel debacle, because Merkur was a relatively low - budget project with limited sales goals.
Still, Merkur's demise is a setback for Ford at a time when the company's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain *T*-1.
The No. 2 auto maker's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models haven't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced *-1, and Ford's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals.
This fall, Ford introduced only one new product: A restyled version of its hulking Lincoln Town Car luxury model.
The demise of Merkur (pronounced * mare - COOR) comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed *PRO*-1 to sell only 93 Scorpios *T*-2.
Total Merkur sales for the first nine months dropped 46% from a year ago to just 6,320 cars.
Merkur isn't the only European luxury brand having problems in the U.S. .
The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as Audi and Saab, which *T*-1 at least have clear brand images.
Merkur, as an import on domestic car lots, suffered from the same sort of image confusion that *T*-1 is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
Merkur was originally aimed *-3 at *PRO* enticing into Lincoln - Mercury dealerships the kind of young, affluent buyers who *T*-2 wouldn't be caught *-1 *PRO*-4 dead in a Town Car--a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event *ICH*-5 next month linking the Town Car's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Va.
But the brand had trouble from the start.
The first Merkur, the XR4Ti, went on sale in early 1985.
The sporty coupe foundered in part because American buyers didn't go for the car's unusual double - wing rear spoiler.
In May 1987, Ford began *-1 importing the Scorpio sedan *ICH*-3 from West Germany 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-2 next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms.
Ford officials said 0 they expected 0 the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year, and in 1988 they reached that goal, as sales hit 15,261 cars.
It was downhill from there, however.
One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark, which *T*-1 began less than a year after Merkur's 1985 launch.
As the West German currency rose, so did *T*-1 Merkur prices.
The Merkur cars also suffered from spotty quality, some dealers say 0 *T*-1.
"It was like a comedy of errors," says *T*-2 Martin J. "Hoot" McInerney, a big dealer whose Star Lincoln - Mercury - Merkur operation in Southfield, Mich., *T*-1 sold more XR4Ti's than any other dealership.
But by the third quarter of 1988, Scorpios had a high satisfaction rating in internal Ford studies, a spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Apparently, however, the improvement came too late.
Last fall, Ford announced 0 it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the U.S. at the end of the 1989 model year.
Ford said then 0 it would keep the Scorpio.
This year, Scorpio sales plummeted, and at the current sales pace it *EXP*-1 would take Ford 242 days *PRO* to sell off the current Scorpio inventory of about 4,600 cars.
A Canadian government agency conditionally approved proposed exports to the U.S. of natural gas from big, untapped fields in the Mackenzie River delta area of the western Canadian Arctic.
Three companies, Esso Resources Canada Ltd., Shell Canada Ltd. and Gulf Canada Resources Ltd., applied to the Canadian National Energy Board *PRO*-1 to export 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta natural gas over 20 years *PRO*-2 starting in 1996.
*PRO*-1 To be economically feasible, the 11 billion Canadian dollar (US$9.37 billion *U*) project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices.
It also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas.
The board said 0 the export licenses would be issued *-1 on the condition that Canadian interests would also be allowed *PRO*-2 to bid for the Mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered * to U.S. customers.
U.S. buyers have already been lined *-1 up.
They include Enron Corp., Texas Eastern Corp., Pacific Interstate Transmission Co. and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
The project could result in the U.S. taking more than 10% of its natural gas supplies *ICH*-1 from Canada, up from about 5% currently.
It would bring 13 gas fields into production at a combined rate of about 1.2 billion cubic feet a day.
The board estimated that the cost of *PRO* building a pipeline from the Mackenzie delta to Alberta would be about C$5.9 million *U*.
It also said 0 projections of surging U.S. demand for natural gas and price forecasts of C$5.25 *U* per thousand cubic feet by 2005 would make the project economically viable.
Esso, a unit of Imperial Oil Ltd. which *T*-1 is 71% - owned by Exxon Corp., will be allowed *PRO*-2 to export 5.1 trillion cubic feet to the U.S. in the 20 - year period.
Shell, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch / Shell Group, will be allowed *PRO*-1 to export 0.9 trillion cubic feet, and Gulf, a unit of Olympia & York Developments Ltd. will be allowed *PRO*-2 to export 3.2 trillion cubic feet.
Robert A. Oswald, chief financial officer and a director of this natural - gas pipeline company, was elected *-1 to the additional position of executive vice president.
In addition, Michael W. O'Donnell, executive vice president of a Columbia unit, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 assistant chief financial officer and a senior vice president of the parent company.
The appointments take effect Nov. 1.

Robert M. Gintel, senior partner of a Greenwich, Conn., investment firm, said 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to launch a proxy fight against the board of Boston - based Xtra Corp.
Mr. Gintel, head of Gintel & Co., said 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to conduct a proxy contest *PRO* to elect a majority of Xtra's board at the next annual stockholders meeting.
Xtra, a transportation leasing company, said in a statement 0 it would have no comment on Mr. Gintel's plans until "further information has been disclosed *-1 by him."
The company also said 0 its 1990 annual meeting has not been scheduled *-1.
Mr. Gintel owns 300,000 of the company's 6.3 million common shares outstanding.
Xtra said 0 it recently bought back approximately 55,000 of its shares pursuant to its existing authorization *PRO* to acquire as many as 650,000 shares.
Mr. Gintel has filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court, *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to block Xtra's anti-takeover tactic.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Gintel said 0 Xtra "has pursued business strategies that *T*-1 aren't in the best interest of stockholders.

Doman Industries Ltd. said 0 it increased its stake in Western Forest Products Ltd. to 56% from 22%, through a two - step transaction valued * at 137 million Canadian dollars ($US116.7 million *U*).
Doman is based *-1 in Duncan, British Columbia.
The company, founded and controlled * by Harbanse Doman, its chairman and president, said 0 the purchase would make it Canada's 10th largest forest products company.
Under terms of the transaction, which *T*-2 was proposed *-1 in June, Doman said 0 it acquired International Forest Products Ltd.'s 22% stake in Western Forest, and Western Forest, in a related transaction, bought back a 22% interest in the company from Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd.
The Fletcher Challenge Canada stake was then canceled *-2, Doman said 0 *?*, *PRO* raising Doman's interest in Western Forest to 56%.
Doman said 0 it was also granted *-2 an option *PRO* to acquire the remaining 44% interest in Western Forest, which *T*-1 is currently held *-3 by two Canadian banks.
International Forest, Western Forest, and Fletcher Challenge Canada are Vancouver - based forest products concerns.

Okay, now you can pick up that phone.
But *PRO* don't do anything rash.
After last Friday's stock - market plunge, investment professionals cautioned people *PRO*-1 to resist the urge *PRO* to call their brokers and sell stocks.
*PRO* Not selling into a panic turned out *-1 to be very good advice: Despite the market's volatility, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 114 points in the past four days.
Now, with a semblance of normalcy returning, some advisers say 0 it's time for investors to take a hard, cold look at the stocks 0 they own *T*-1 and consider some careful pruning.
"The market is sending nervous signals," says 0 *?* Peter J. Canelo, chief market strategist for Bear, Stearns & Co., and it *EXP*-3's "unwise" *PRO* to be overcommitted *-1 to stocks.
Alan Weston, president of Weston Capital Management, a Los Angeles money - management firm, adds that in periods of uncertainty like today, "it's a good time 0 *PRO* to cut out the dead branches of your portfolio *T*-1."
Not everybody agrees that it's time 0 *PRO* to trim *T*-1.
"We aren't inclined *PRO*-1 to prune stock portfolios now," says *T*-2 Steven G. Einhorn, chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.
"Investors should stay with their stocks.
We expect a choppy and sloppy market for a short period, but we don't think 0 it will be ugly.
The downside is limited."
And even those who *T*-1 say 0 some selective selling may be in order stress that individuals need *-2 to be in the stock market *PRO* to achieve their long - term investment objectives and to help *PRO*-4 balance their other assets.
Any selling, they say 0 *?*, should be well thought - out, and executed *-2 gradually, during market rallies.
They offer these suggestions:
*PRO* GET RID OF THE DOGS.
"*PRO* Sell stocks that *T*-1 aren't doing well now, and that *T*-3 don't have good earnings prospects," says *T*-2 Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at St. Louis - based A.G. Edwards & Sons.
"Most people do just the opposite: They sell their winners and keep their losers."
Which types of stocks *T*-1 are most likely *PRO*-2 to qualify?
Technology stocks, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Goldman.
*PRO* WATCH FOR EARNINGS DISAPPOINTMENTS.
A company doesn't have *-1 to post a loss *PRO*-1 to be a candidate for sale, says 0 *T*-2 Charles I. Clough Jr., chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co.
If earnings don't live up to analysts' expectations, he says 0 *?*, that's enough *PRO* to dump the stock.
John Markese, director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors, raises a cautionary note.
"*PRO* Substituting a rule of thumb for your own judgment" can be a mistake, he says 0 *T*-1.
An earnings disappointment may reflect a situation that *T*-1's short - term.
But Mr. Clough says, "The risk is that earnings disappointments will continue."
The economy is decelerating after six good years, and "right now it *EXP*-1's better *PRO* to shoot first and ask questions later."
Which types of stocks *T*-1 currently have the greatest earnings risks?
Computer companies; commodity cyclical stocks, like autos; and retailing stocks, he says 0 *T*-1.
*PRO* BEWARE OF HEAVY DEBT.
The companies apt *PRO* to run into earnings problems soonest are the ones with heavy debt loads, says 0 *T*-1 Larry Biehl, partner in the San Mateo, Calif., money - management firm of Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser.
Mr. Canelo of Bear Stearns agrees: "If we do have an economic slowdown," he says *?*, "companies with high debt ratios will be dumped *-2 en masse."
The best course for individual investors is *PRO* to sell these stocks now, the two advisers say 0 *T*-2.
*PRO* SELL ` WHISPER' STOCKS.
UAL Corp.'s difficulty in *PRO* obtaining bank financing for its leveraged buy - out and its resulting price plunge is a tip - off to what *T*-1's going *-2 to happen to "takeover stocks," says 0 *T*-3 Mr. Canelo.
Takeover activity will slow down as more and more banks tighten their lending requirements, he says 0 *T*-1.
"There'll be fewer and fewer deals."
Moreover, many financial advisers say 0 individuals should be in the stock market as long - term investors, not as traders trying *PRO* to catch the next hot stock.
In general, they say 0 *?*, *PRO* avoid takeover stocks.
*PRO* COMPARE P / E RATIOS WITH PROSPECTS.
Mr. Canelo suggests that investors compare price / earnings ratios (the price of a share of stock divided * by a company's per - share earnings for a 12 - month period) with projected growth rates.
"If you think 0 earnings will grow at 20% a year, it *EXP*-2's all right *PRO* to pay 20 times earnings," he says *T*-1.
"But *PRO* don't pay 30 times earnings for a company that *T*-1's expected *-2 to grow at 15% a year."
Mr. Canelo thinks 0 the market will probably go higher, but "will be ruthless with stocks if the earnings aren't there."
Mr. Markese cautions that investors shouldn't slavishly follow any specific price / earnings sell trigger.
"If you say *PRO* sell anytime 0 a company's price / earnings ratio exceeds 15 *T*-1, that knocks out all your growth stocks," he says *T*-2.
"You eliminate companies with substantial prospects that *T*-1 are moving up in price."
*PRO* EXAMINE WHAT *T*-1 HAS CHANGED.
Tom Schlesinger, market analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., says 0 investors should consider selling if there has been a fundamental change in a company since they bought its stock.
*PRO* Say 0 you purchased a stock because of a new product that *T*-1 was in the works.
Now, because of various difficulties, the product has been scrapped *-1.
Time 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-1, says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Schlesinger.
Similarly, he says 0 *?*, *PRO* suppose 0 you were attracted *-1 to a company because of expectations that sales would hit $200 million *U* by 1990.
If things haven't worked out that well, and sales won't hit $200 million *U* until 1992, it's time 0 *PRO* to consider selling *T*-2, he says 0 *T*-1.
The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons legislation 0 *T*-1 to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial government - owned telephone utilities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more competition in the telephone business in the three provinces, federal officials said 0 *T*-1.
The federal government initiative follows a recent Canadian Supreme Court decision that *T*-1 held that the major telephone companies in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast provinces were interprovincial undertakings and subject to federal legislative authority.
Prior to the ruling the federal government had regulated only the telephone companies in Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.
The governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have strongly opposed federal regulation of their telephone companies.
The extension of federal regulatory authority over telephone utilities in the Atlantic provinces hasn't required special legislation because they are investor - owned.
Capital Holding Corp. said 0 it requested and received the resignation of John A. Franco, its vice chairman, as an officer and a director of the life insurance holding company.
The company said 0 Mr. Franco developed a plan *PRO* to establish a business that *T*-1 might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp.'s Accumulation and Investment Group, which Mr. Franco headed *T*-2.
The group temporarily will report to Irving W. Bailey II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Capital Holding.
Mr. Franco, 47 years old, said in a telephone interview that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures, but that "nothing is at a mature stage."
He said 0 he "didn't argue with" the company's decision *PRO* to seek his resignation because *PRO*-3 contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from *PRO*-4 performing his best "at the job 0 he is paid *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1."
Martin H. Ruby, a managing director of Capital Holding's Accumulation and Investment Group, also resigned *PRO*-1 to pursue other business interests, Capital Holding said 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Ruby, 39, said that he had "an amicable parting" with Capital Holding and that he has "a number of ventures in the financial - services area" under consideration.
He said that his resignation was a mutual decision with Capital Holding management, but that he wasn't actually asked *-1 *-2 *PRO*-3 to resign.
The Accumulation and Investment Group is responsible for the investment operations of all Capital Holding's insurance businesses and markets guaranteed investment contracts to bank trust departments and other institutions.
It also sells single - premium annuities to individuals.
Mr. Bailey said 0 he expects *PRO*-1 to name a new group president 0 *T*-2 to head that operation following the Nov. 8 board meeting.
VIACOM Inc.'s loss narrowed to $21.7 million *U* in the third quarter from $56.9 million *U* a year ago.
Thursday's edition misstated the narrowing.
Corporate efforts *PRO* to control health - care costs by *PRO*-1 requiring evaluations prior to planned hospitalization and surgery haven't been sweeping enough *PRO*-2 to reduce the long - term rate of cost increases, according to a study by the Institute of Medicine.
In the last decade, many corporations have embraced the "utilization management" cost containment strategy as a way 0 *PRO* to control health - care costs for employees *T*-1.
These programs vary widely, but often require second opinions on proposed surgery, preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods.
Between 50% and 75% *U* of today's workers are covered *-1 by such plans, up from 5% five years ago.
"Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers, utilization management--like most other cost containment strategies--doesn't appear *-1 to have altered the long - term rate of increase in health - care costs," the Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded *T*-2 after a two - year study.
"Employers who *T*-1 saw a short - term moderation in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends."
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs, these savings are often offset *-1 by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs, according to the report by a panel of health - care experts.
The report suggested that current review programs are too narrow.
"The unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital, and not the actual need for a particular procedure, has been the main focus," the panel said *T*-1.
"As a general rule, prior - review programs have not made case - by - case assessments of the comparative costs of alternative treatments or sites of care."
The report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps *PRO*-1 lead to medical practice guidelines.
Howard Bailit, a panel member and a vice president of Aetna Life & Casualty, said that utilization management will also do a better job of *PRO* containing costs as it spreads *PRO*-1 to cover medical services delivered * outside of hospitals.
"There's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization," he said *T*-1.
But at the same time, spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed.
"It's like *PRO* squeezing a balloon," Dr. Bailit said *T*-1.
David Rahill of A. Foster Higgins & Co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about 5%, but he agreed that for the health - care system as whole, some of these savings are offset *-1 by administrative and outpatient care costs.
Jerome Grossman, chairman of the panel, agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high.
"You have a whole staff standing *PRO*-2 ready" *PRO*-3 to evaluate the appropriateness of recommended treatment, he said 0 *T*-1.
Dr. Grossman, who *T*-1 also is president of New England Medical Center Hospitals in Boston, noted that the hospitals 0 he runs *T*-2 deal with more than 100 utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements.
The panel urged greater efforts *PRO* to reduce the complexity, paperwork and cost of utilization review.
"Utilization management needs *-1 to better demonstrate that it reduces the wasteful use of resources, improves the appropriateness of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and providers," the panel concluded *T*-2.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled unanimously that the financial troubles facing the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear - power plant have no impact on whether the plant receives a full - power license.
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, *PRO*-1 opposing the license, said 0 he will appeal the ruling in federal court.
Seabrook officials said 0 the plant could receive a full - power license by the end of the year.
The NRC rejected Mr. Shannon's argument that Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which *T*-1 owns the largest share of Seabrook, and 11 other owners are financially unable *PRO*-2 to guarantee the plant's safe operation.
Mr. Shannon was seeking a waiver of NRC policy that *T*-1 ignores financial considerations in *PRO*-2 making licensing decisions.
In its ruling, the NRC said that because Seabrook will be allowed *PRO*-1 to charge rates sufficient *PRO* to run the plant and make payments on past construction costs, consideration of the owners' financial condition is pointless.
"The commissioners found 0 the circumstances of the case didn't undercut the assurance from government rate setters of available funds adequate for safe operation," said *T*-1 a commission spokesman.
In January 1988, the utility filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, *PRO* allowing it to continue *-1 to operate while *PRO*-3 protected *-2 from creditors' lawsuits.
Is an American Secretary of State seriously suggesting that the Khmer Rouge should help *PRO*-1 govern Cambodia?
Apparently so.
There are no easy choices in Cambodia, but we can't imagine that it *EXP*-2 benefits the U.S. *PRO*-3 to become the catalyst for an all - too - familiar process that *T*-1 could end in another round of horror in Cambodia.
Now that Vietnam appears *-1 to have pulled out its occupation army, the State Department is talking again about *PRO*-2 accepting an "interim" coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh.
The coalition would include the current Vietnamese - backed Hun Sen regime, the two non-communist resistance groups led * by Son Sann and Prince Sihanouk, and the Khmer Rouge.
The aim would be *PRO* to end the guerrilla war for control of Cambodia by *PRO*-1 allowing the Khmer Rouge a small share of power.
The State Department says that any Khmer Rouge participation would have *-1 to be "minimal."
The usual problem with *PRO* including communists in "interim" coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require 0 they squeeze out everyone else.
*PRO* Recall that Nicaragua's Sandinistas came into Managua as partners in a coalition government with anti-Somoza moderates.
Within two years, the moderates were exiled *-1 or in prison, Nicaragua had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors.
In Laos, when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition *T*-1 it turned out 0 they were opening the door to communist domination.
Even Mao Tse - tung's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties.
What *T*-1 complicates the scene in Cambodia is that the current regime is already communist, as are *?* its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are *?* the Khmer Rouge--who *T*-2 are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.
It *EXP*-2's not clear which crew of communists *T*-1 might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear.
That would leave Hun Sen and the Khmer Rouge.
The Hun Sen regime has sent thousands of conscript laborers to die of malaria and malnourishment while *PRO*-1 building Cambodia's equivalent of the Berlin Wall near the Thai border.
The Khmer Rouge, however, carry an unsurpassed record for Cambodian tyranny.
These utopians caused the deaths *ICH*-1--by starvation, disease or execution--of well over one million Cambodians.
The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief.
The world might want *PRO*-1 to believe that the Khmer Rouge can't still be such bad guys, just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant *PRO*-2 to credit the reports of genocide then taking place.
But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed.
Some of our sources in Thailand say 0 the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, has been holed *-1 up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai - Cambodian border.
So it *EXP*-2's difficult *PRO* to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing *PRO*-3 to accept conditions that *T*-1 would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh.
True, Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week.
But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia.
Nor should the U.S. worry much about *PRO*-2 offending China, which still *T*-1 aids the Khmer Rouge.
It's time 0 the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen's rules *T*-1.
For the U.S. to lend even the slightest support to the most infamous killers on Indochina's bleak scene could only disturb America's allies elsewhere.
It *EXP*-1 would be entirely rational for communist insurgents in countries such as the Philippines or Peru to conclude the following: *PRO* Fight viciously enough and the U.S., under the banner of pragmatism, might eventually help *PRO* negotiate your way to victory.
U.S. diplomacy has done it before, and it will likely do it again.
The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of *PRO* sending military aid to Cambodia's non-communists.
But now the possibility of "diplomatic movement" (Vietnam's withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the U.S. would then rearm the opposition.
Why the timidity?
At the very least, the odds are heavily weighted *-1 against the prospects of *PRO* preventing the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia's communists from *PRO*-2 ultimately moving against their opponents.
When that day comes *T*-1, it *EXP*-2 would be particularly awful *PRO* to know that the United States sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means 0 *PRO* to settle their fate with at least a little honor *T*-3.
In the long, frightening night after Tuesday's devastating earthquake, Bay Area residents searched for comfort and solace wherever they could *?* *T*-1.
Some found it on the screen of a personal computer.
Hundreds of Californians made their way to their computers after the quake, and checked in with each other on electronic bulletin boards, which *T*-1 link computers CB - radio - style, via phone lines.
Some of the most vivid bulletins came over The Well, a Sausalito, Calif., board that *T*-1 is one of the liveliest outposts of the electronic underground.
About two - thirds of the Well's 3,000 subscribers live in the Bay Area.
The quake knocked The Well out for six hours, but when it came back up *T*-1, it teemed with emotional first - hand reports.
Following are excerpts from the electronic traffic that night.
The time is Pacific Daylight Time, and the initials or nicknames are those 0 subscribers use *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to identify themselves.

JCKC:
Wow!
I was in the avenues, on the third floor of an old building, and except for my heart (Beat, BEAT!) I'm OK.
*PRO* Got back to Bolinas, and everything had fallen: broken poster frames with glass on the floor, file cabinets open or dumped * onto the floor.
11:59 p.m.
JKD:
I was in my favorite watering hole, *PRO*-1 waiting for the game to start.
I felt the temblor begin and glanced at the table next to mine, smiled that guilty smile and we both mouthed the words, "Earth - quake!" together.
That's usually how long it *EXP*-2 takes for the temblors to pass *T*-1.
This time, it just got stronger and then the building started *-2 shaking violently up and down as though it were a child's toy block that *T*-1 was being tossed *-3.
12:06 a.m.
HRH:
I was in the Berkeley Main library when it hit *T*-1.
Endless seconds *PRO* wondering if those huge windows would buckle and shower us with glass.
Only a few books fell in the reading room.
Then the auto paint shop fire sent an evil - looking cloud of black smoke into the air.
12:07 a.m.
ONEZIE:
My younger daughter and I are fine.
This building shook like hell and it kept *PRO*-1 getting stronger.
Except for the gas tank at Hustead's Towing Service exploding and burning in downtown Berkeley, things here are quite peaceful.
A lot of car alarms went off.
The cats are fine, although nervous.
12:15 a.m.
DHAWK:
Huge fire from broken gas main in the Marina in SF.
Areas that *T*-2 are made *-1 of ` fill' liquefy.
A woman in a three - story apartment was able *PRO*-1 to walk out the window of the third floor onto street level after the quake.
The house just settled right down into the ground.
12:38 a.m.
DAYAC:
I was driving my truck, stopped *-2 at a red light at the corner of Shattuck and Alcatraz at the Oakland - Berkeley border when it hit *T*-1.
Worst part was watching power lines waving above my head and no way 0 *PRO* to drive away *T*-1.
12:48 a.m.
LMEYER:
*PRO* Was 300 ft. out on a pier in San Rafael.
It flopped all around, * real dramatic!
Many hairline cracks in the concrete slabs afterwards.
*PRO* Ruined the damn fishing!
1:00 a.m.
HEYNOW:
I rode it out on the second floor of Leo's at 55th and Telegraph in Oakland.
I heard parts of the building above my head cracking.
I actually thought that I might die.
I couldn't decide if I should come home to Marin, because my house is on stilts.
I decided *PRO*-1 to brave the storm.
There was a horrible smell of gas as I passed the Chevron refinery before *PRO*-1 crossing the Richmond - San Rafael Bridge.
I could also see the clouds across the bay from the horrible fire in the Marina District of San Francisco.
I have felt many aftershocks.
My back is still in knots and my hands are still shaking.
I think 0 a few of the aftershocks might just be my body shaking.
1:11 a.m.
GR8FLRED:
I could see the flames from San Francisco from my house across the bay.
It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to believe 0 this really is happening.

Building on the corner severely damaged *-1, so an old lady and her very old mother are in the guest room.
Books and software everywhere.

Bolinas--astride the San Andreas Fault.
*PRO* Didn't feel a thing, but noticed some strange bird behavior.
Duck swarms.
3:25 a.m.
SAMURAI:
I just felt another aftershock a few seconds ago.
I'm just numb.
3:25 a.m.
MACPOST:
Downtown Bolinas seems *-2 to be the part of town that *T*-1's worst off.
No power, minimal phones, and a mess of mayonnaise, wine, and everything else all over the floors of the big old general store and the People's Co-op.
The quivers move through my house every few minutes at unpredictable intervals, and the mouse that *T*-1's been living in my kitchen has taken refuge under my desk.
It runs out frantically now and then, and is clearly pretty distressed.
I was in Stinson Beach when the quake rolled through town *T*-1.
At first, we were unfazed *-1.
Then as things got rougher, we ran for the door and spent the next few minutes outside *PRO*-1 watching the brick sidewalk under our feet oozing up and down, and the flowers waving in an eerie rhythm.
Amazing what it does *T*-1 to one's heart rate and one's short - term memory.
Everyone looked calm, but there was this surreal low level of confusion as the aftershocks continued.
4:02 a.m.
SHIBUMI:
Power is back on, and UCSF {medical center} seems *-1 to have quieted down for the night (they were doing triage out in the parking lot from the sound and lights of it).
A friend of mine was in an underground computer center in downtown SF when the quake hit *T*-1.
He said that one of the computers took a three - foot trip *PRO*-1 sliding across the floor.
Today should be interesting as people realize how hard life is going *-2 to be *T*-1 here for a while.
4:30 a.m.
KIM:
I got home, let the dogs into the house and noticed some sounds above my head, as if someone were walking on the roof, or upstairs.
Then I noticed 0 the car was bouncing up and down as if someone were jumping on it.
I realized what *T*-1 was happening and screamed into the house for the dogs.
Cupboard doors were flying, the trash can in the kitchen walked a few feet, the dogs came running, and I scooted them into the dog run and stood in the doorway myself, *PRO*-1 watching the outside trash cans dance across the concrete.
When I realized 0 it was over *T*-1, I went and stood out in front of the house, *PRO*-2 waiting and praying for Merrill to come home, shivering as if it were 20 below zero until he got there.
Never in my life have I been so frightened.
When I saw the pictures of 880 and the Bay Bridge *T*-1, I began *-2 to cry.
5:09 a.m.
JROE:
The Sunset {District} was more or less like a pajama party all evening, lots of people & dogs walking around, drinking beer.
6:50 a.m.
CAROLG:
I was just sitting down *PRO*-1 to meet with some new therapy clients, a couple, and the building started *-2 shaking like crazy.
It's a flimsy structure, built * up on supports, and it was really rocking around.
The three of us stopped *-1 breathing for a moment, and then when it kept on *PRO*-3 coming *T*-2 we lunged for the doorway.
*PRO* Needless *PRO* to say, it was an interesting first session!
7:13 a.m.
CALLIOPE:
Albany escaped *PRO*-1 embarrassingly unscathed.
Biggest trouble was scared family who *T*-1 couldn't get a phone line through, and spent a really horrible hour *PRO*-2 not knowing.
8:01 a.m.
HLR:
Judy and I were in our back yard when the lawn started *-2 rolling like ocean waves *T*-1.
We ran into the house *PRO*-2 to get Mame, but the next tremor threw me in the air and bounced me as I tried *PRO*-1 to get to my feet.
We are all fine here, although Mame was extremely freaked.
Kitchen full of broken crystal.
Books and tapes all over my room.
Not one thing in the house is where it is supposed *-2 to be *T*-1, but the structure is fine.
While I was standing on the lawn with Mame, *PRO*-1 waiting for another tremor, I noticed that all the earthworms were emerging from the ground and slithering across the lawn!
9:31 a.m.
GR8FLRED:
It *EXP*-2's amazing how one second can so completely change your life *T*-1.
9:38 a.m.
FIG:
I guess 0 we're all living very tentatively here, *PRO*-1 waiting for the expected but dreaded aftershock.
It *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to accept that it's over and only took 15 seconds.
I wonder when we'll be able *PRO*-2 to relax *T*-1.
9:53 a.m.
PANDA:
Flesh goes to total alert for flight or fight.
Nausea seems *-1 a commonplace symptom.
Berkeley very quiet right now.
I walked along Shattuck between Delaware and Cedar at a few minutes before eight this morning.
Next to Chez Panisse a homeless couple, *PRO*-1 bundled * into a blue sleeping bag, sat up, said, "Good morning" and then the woman smiled, said, "Isn't it *EXP*-2 great *PRO* just to be alive?"
I agreed.
It is *?*.
Great.
The scene opens with pinstripe - suited executives--Easterners, obviously--glued * to cellular phones and hightailing it out of town in chauffeur - driven limousines.
"The carpetbaggers," snorts *?* the narrator with a Texas twang, "have packed their bags and went."
But, he continues 0 *?*, "They're forgetting 0 we're all Texans.
The Lone Star is on the rise again."
As the music swells, viewers discover 0 they're watching a commercial for Lone Star Beer, the pride of Texas, a product of G. Heileman Brewing Co., a La Crosse, Wis., unit of Bond Corp.
As the ad's tone implies, the Texas spirit is pretty xenophobic these days, and Lone Star isn't alone in *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-1 to take advantage of that.
From Chevy trucks to Lipton iced tea to a host of battling banks, the state has been inundated *-1 with broadcast commercials and print advertising campaigns celebrating Texans and castigating outsiders.
While advertisers have long appealed to Texans' state pride and prejudices, the latest trend has been sparked *-1, in part, by the state's recent hard economic times.
That has taken some of the swagger out of natives who *T*-1 like *PRO*-3 to brag that Texas is the only state that *T*-2 was once a nation, but it has increased their legendary resentment of outsiders.
In the past, writes 0 *?* Houston Chronicle columnist Jim Barlow, outlanders were accepted *-1 only after *PRO*-1 passing a series of tests 0 *T*-4 to prove 0 they had the "right" Texas attitudes and "of course they had *-5 to be dipped *-2 for parasites."
There is no small irony in the fact that some of the most - jingoistic advertising comes courtesy of--you guessed it--outsiders.
Lone Star's Bond Corp. parent, for instance, hails from Perth, Australia.
North Carolinians, New Yorkers, Californians, Chicagoans and Ohioans own Texas banks.
All kinds of landmark Texas real estate has been snapped *-1 up by out - of - staters.
Even the beloved Dallas Cowboys were bought *-1 by an Arkansas oil man.
"Texas has lost its distinctiveness, *PRO* leaving Texans with a hunger *PRO* to feel proud about themselves," says *T*-1 Stephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University, Houston.
"This plays right into the hands of the advertising agencies."
For example, the iced - tea radio campaign for Thomas J. Lipton Co., an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., unit of Anglo - Dutch Unilever Group, emphatically proclaims: "Real Texans do not wear dock - siders--ever.
Real Texans don't play paddleball, at least I hope not.
This is football country.
And another thing--real Texans drink Lipton iced tea."
In *PRO*-1 developing that theme at Interpublic Group of Cos .' Lintas: New York unit, account supervisor Lisa Buksbaum says 0 she made a "couple of phone calls" to Dallas ad friends and reported her "findings" to a team of writers.
Her findings?
"You know," she says *T*-1, "stereotypical stuff like armadillos, cowboys and football."
Not exactly sophisticated market research, but who *T*-1 cares as long as the campaigns work.
And ad agencies insist that they do *?*.
Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc., Dallas, tells of the Texan who *T*-1 saw the agency's tear - jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B.--complete with the state's anthem--and promptly invested $100,000 *U* in the thrift's CDs.
*PRO* Never mind that First Gibraltar is one of the failed Texas thrifts taken * over by outsiders--in this case, an investor group headed * by New York financier Ronald Perelman.
The North Texas Chevy Dealers recently had a record sales month after the debut of ad campaign that *T*-1 thumbs its nose at elite Easterners.
And deposits at NCNB Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have increased $2 billion *U* since last year after heavy advertising stressing commitment to Texas.
"Obviously, pride sells in Texas," says *T*-2 a spokeswoman for Bozell Inc., Omaha, Neb., which *T*-1 represents
The ad campaigns usually follow one of three tracks--*PRO* stressing the company's ` Texasness,' pointing out the competition's lack thereof, or trying *PRO*-2 to be more Texan than Texans.
Ford trucks may outsell Chevy trucks in places like "Connecticut and Long Island," sniffs 0 *T*-1 a commercial for Chevrolet, a division of General Motors Corp.
The commercial, created * by Bateman, Bryan & Galles Inc., of Dallas, adds derisively: "I bet 0 it *EXP*-1 takes a real tough truck *PRO* to haul your Ivy League buddies to the yacht club."
Because they want a truck that *T*-1 is "Texas tough," the commercial concludes 0 *?*, "Texans drive Chevy."
J.C. Penney Co., which *T*-1 relocated from New York to suburban Dallas two years ago, gently wraps itself in Texas pride through a full - page magazine ad: "*PRO* Taking the long - range view *PRO*-4 to conserve what *T*-2 is of value to future generations is part of the Lone Star lifestyle," the ad reads *T*-3.
"It's part of our style, too."
According to several ad - agency sources, newcomers to the Texas banking market are spending a combined $50 million *U* this year *PRO*-1 to woo Texans.
Meanwhile, surviving Texas banking institutions are busily pitching themselves as the only lenders who *T*-1 truly care about the state.
The most - strident anti-outsider sentiment among bankers comes from the Independent Bankers Association of Texas, although it *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to tell from previews of the $5 million *U* "The I's of Texas" TV campaign.
Commercials will highlight heart - rending scenes of Texas and chest - swelling, ain't - it *EXP*-1 - great - *PRO* to - be - a - Texan music.
Supporting banks will sign a "Texas Declaration of Independents."
But in introductory material for the campaign, the trade group urges members *PRO*-1 to "arm" for a "revolution" against big, out - of - state bank - holding companies.
A video sent * to association members, featuring shots of the Alamo, cowboys, fajitas and a statue of Sam Houston, doesn't mince words.
"Texans can sniff a phony a mile away," the narrator warns outsiders *T*-1.
"So, *PRO* don't come and try *PRO*-1 to con us with a howdy y'all or a cowboy hat."
Young & Rubicam's Pact
Young & Rubicam, *PRO*-1 fighting charges that it bribed Jamaican officials *PRO*-2 to win the Jamaica Tourist Board ad account in 1981, said 0 it will no longer create the tourist board's advertising.
In a statement, Alex Kroll, Young & Rubicam's chairman, said "under the present circumstances {we} have agreed that it *EXP*-1 is prudent *PRO* to discontinue that contract."
Young & Rubicam has pleaded innocent to the charges.
The board wouldn't comment on its impending search for a new ad agency 0 *T*-1 to handle its estimated $5 million to $6 million *U* account.
Ad Notes....
NEW ACCOUNT:
Sunshine Biscuits Inc., Woodbridge, N.J., awarded its estimated $5 million *U* account to Waring & LaRosa, New York.
The account had been at Della Femina McNamee WCRS, New York.
MEDIA POLICY:
MacNamara Clapp & Klein, a small New York shop, is asking magazine ad representatives *PRO*-2 to tell it when major advertising inserts will run in their publications *T*-1.
It says 0 it may pull its clients' ads from those magazines.
COKE ADS:
Coca - Cola Co. said 0 it produced a new version of its 1971 "I'd like *PRO*-1 to teach the world *PRO*-2 to sing" commercial.
The ad is part of Classic Coke's 1990 ad campaign, with the tag line, "*PRO* Can't beat the Real Thing."
Basketball star Michael Jordan and singer Randy Travis have also agreed *PRO*-1 to appear in ads.
Three savings - and - loan institutions in Kansas and Texas were added *-1 to the Resolution Trust Corp.'s conservatorship program after federal regulators declared the thrifts insolvent and named the RTC *PRO*-2 their receiver.
The deposits, assets and certain liabilities of the three thrifts were transferred *-1 to newly chartered federal mutual institutions.
The three institutions are: Mid Kansas Federal Savings & Loan Association, Wichita, which *T*-1 had $830.5 million *U* in assets; Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association of McAllen, McAllen, Texas, with $582.6 million *U* in assets; and Surety Savings Association, El Paso, with $309.3 million *U* in assets.
The three insolvent thrifts will maintain normal business hours and operations under RTC - appointed managing agents, while the RTC tries *PRO*-1 to negotiate permanent resolutions.
Separately, Century Bank, Phoenix, Ariz., was closed *-1 by Arizona banking officials.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. approved the assumption of Century's deposits and fully secured liabilities by a newly chartered subsidiary of Valley Capital Corp., Las Vegas.
The new institution is also called *-1 *PRO*-2 Century Bank, and the failed bank's five offices will reopen today.
The failed bank had assets of about $129.6 million *U*.
The newly chartered bank will assume about $125.7 million *U* in 10,300 deposit accounts and pay the FDIC a purchase premium of $2.9 million *U*.
It also will buy about $91.7 million *U* of assets, and the FDIC will advance $31.8 million *U* to the assuming bank.
International Business Machines Corp. and MCA Inc. said 0 they agreed *PRO*-1 to sell their Discovision Associates joint venture to U.S. units of Pioneer Electronic Corp. for $200 million *U*.
The joint venture licenses a portfolio of about 1,400 patents and patent applications relating to optical - disk recording technology.
IBM and MCA formed Discovision in 1979 *PRO*-1 to make laser - read optical products.
But the partners didn't believe 0 the market for the systems was developing as rapidly as they had hoped 0 *?*.
After *PRO*-1 reportedly investing $100 million *U* in the business, Discovision ceased manufacturing operations in 1982 and sold many of its assets to Tokyo - based Pioneer, among others.
Discovision now has world - wide license agreements with major manufacturers covering CD audio disks, audio disk players, videodisks and videodisk players.
It also licenses optically based data storage and retrieval devices.
James N. Fiedler, president of Discovision and a vice president of MCA, said that IBM and MCA hadn't planned *PRO*-2 to sell the joint venture, which *T*-1 is now profitable, but that Pioneer approached Discovision earlier this year.
He said 0 it *EXP*-2 isn't certain whether Discovision's current management will remain when Pioneer buys the company *T*-1.
The agreement is contingent on certain government approvals and should be completed *-1 later this year.
Where do Americans put their money *T*-1?
It depends on when you look *T*-1.
In 1900, for instance, less than 8% of assets went into bank deposits.
That rose to nearly 18% during the Depression, and hasn't changed much since.
Pension reserves, on the other hand, made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade, when they skyrocketed *T*-1.
And there has been a drastic decline in the importance of unincorporated business assets--thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms.
That's some of what *T*-1 emerges from the following charts, which *T*-2 show how Americans have changed their investment patterns over the past 90 years *T*-3.
Some results are self - explanatory.
But other figures are surprising.
Housing, for instance, has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade--although common wisdom would have expected an increase.
"There is a lot of attention paid * to housing as a form of household wealth," says *T*-1 Edward N. Wolff, professor of economics at New York University.
"But it hasn't increased much relative to other assets.
It suggests that households accumulate wealth across a broad spectrum of assets.
And housing though it appears in the popular mind as *PRO*-1 being the major {growing} household asset, isn't *?*."
In addition, investors' desire *PRO* to hold stocks--directly and through mutual funds--has held *PRO*-1 surprisingly steady; stocks' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and downs of the stock market, and not a shift in stock - holding preferences.
"Stocks have not spread to the general public, despite the fact that the environment is much different," concludes *T*-1 Robert Avery, an economist at Cornell University.
"To me it says *T*-1 that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets, we have ways of *PRO* holding wealth similar to 100 years ago."
-- The charts show how househld assets have been distributed *-1 *T*-2 over time.
The main components of the various asseet categories: Housing: Primary home, but not the land 0 it's on *T*-1.
Land and Other Real Estate: Land on which primary home is built *-1 *T*-2, investment property.
Consumer Durables: Automobiles, appliances, furniture.
Bank Deposits: Currency, checking - account deposits, small savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, money - market fund shares.
Bonds: *PRO* Excludes bond funds.
Stocks / Mutual Funds: Stocks and mutual funds other than money - market funds.
Unincorporated Business: Partnerships and sole proprietorships, professional corporations.
Pension Reserves: Holdings by pension funds.
Housing construction sank in September to its lowest level since the last recession, the Commerce Department reported 0 *T*-1.
Work *ICH*-1 began on homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1,263,000 units last month, down 5.2% from August, the department said 0 *T*-2.
The September decline followed an even steeper drop of 6.2% in August and left housing starts at their weakest since October 1982, when the country was nearing the end of a recession *T*-1.
Originally the department had reported the August decline as 5%.
The numbers suggest that the housing industry is still suffering the effects of the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation.
The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer, after the central bank began *-1 to relax its clamp on credit, *PRO*-2 allowing interest rates to drop a bit after *PRO*-3 pushing them up for a year.
Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses, which *T*-1 had been climbing, dropped.
But last month new construction in all types of homes waned, from single - family houses to large apartment complexes.
"It's pretty much weak across the board," said *T*-1 Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions.
Mr. Regalia said 0 the industry may be reluctant *PRO*-1 to step up building at the moment for fear 0 the inventories of unsold homes will increase again.
Another reason for the weakness, he said 0 *?*, may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began *-1 edging down after a peak in March.
In August, rates on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages started *-1 creeping up a bit, but they inched down again through September.
"Rates haven't really peeled off that much," Mr. Regalia said *T*-1.
"We've kind of settled now into an interest - rate environment that *T*-1's fairly high."
Work *ICH*-2 was begun *-1 on single family homes--the core of the housing market--at an annual rate of 971,000 *ICH*-3 in September, a drop of 2.1% from the previous month.
That followed a 3.3% decline in August.
Construction of apartments and other multi-family dwellings slipped 2.2% to an annual rate of 1,022,000 following a 3.5% decline in August.
The number of building permits issued * for future construction dropped 2.4% to a 1,296,000 annual rate after *PRO*-1 rising 3.7% in August.
All the numbers were adjusted *-1 for normal seasonal variations in building activity.
The housing starts numbers, however, are one of the least precise of the government's economic indicators and are often revised *-2 significantly as more information is collected *-1.
Tuesday's earthquake will depress local real - estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider *PRO*-1 expanding in *RNR*-2 or relocating to *RNR*-2 the Bay Area and California, real - estate and relocation specialists said 0 *T*-3.
Few specialists said 0 they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most California property values.
But real - estate experts and brokers said 0 the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built * on less stable ground, especially in the Bay Area.
"California prices were already coming down.
This isn't going *-1 to help," said *T*-2 Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
State housing prices, at a median $201,028 *U*, have declined in recent months because of potential buyers' inability *PRO* to afford homes.
Mr. Rosen, among others, suggested that the quake, the strongest since the 1906 temblor that *T*-1 struck San Francisco, will in the short term create a two - tier price system for quake - prone communities, with dwellings built * on sturdy ground likely *PRO* to demand higher prices.
One San Francisco neighborhood likely *PRO* to test Mr. Rosen's theory soon is the city's fashionable Marina district, which *T*-1 boasts some of the highest home prices in the state.
The district, built * on landfill, suffered heavy quake damage, including collapsed buildings.
Yesterday, the city demolished two dwellings in the district because of severe structural damage and said 0 as many as 19 of the district's 350 dwellings might have *-2 to be razed *-1.
Brokers agreed with the two - tier price theory.
"My gut feeling is that the Marina properties will be affected *-1," said *T*-2 Grace Perkins, senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis Residential Brokerage Inc.
Neither she nor other real - estate executives and brokers could project how much less Marina properties might bring *T*-1, but she said 0 the two - tier price structure would affect prices "for a while."
Mr. Rosen said 0 the quake will revive consumer interest in a little - publicized 1972 state law that *T*-1 requires brokers *PRO*-3 to disclose to potential buyers how close a property sits to a fault line *T*-2.
Because of the size of the California market, few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake's aftermath.
But they said 0 the quake will force some companies *PRO*-1 to relocate or expand part or all of their operations outside the state.
"What you're going *-1 to get *T*-2 is ` We don't want *PRO*-3 to put all of our eggs in one basket' theory," said *T*-4 James H. Renzas, president of Location Management Services Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., relocation concern.
Mr. Renzas, among others, said 0 the quake will prod companies in certain industries, like semiconductors, computers and aerospace, to consider *PRO*-2 moving operations that *T*-1 involve particularly sensitive machinery to locations outside California.
Because of the quake threat, "some firms have evaluated what the cost *ICH*-3 is *T*-1 *PRO* to shore up their buildings and compared it with the cost of *PRO* building it elswehere," he said 0 *T*-2.
One Southern California aerospace firm, for example, two months ago asked Location Management *PRO*-1 to compare the costs of *PRO* reinforcing its current building against earthquakes with the cost of *PRO* building a new structure elsewhere.
A new dwelling would cost $21 million *U*, Location Management found 0 *?*, compared with $22 million *U* to make the present building earthquake - proof.
The company, Mr. Renzas said 0 *?*, hasn't yet determined what *PRO* to do *T*-1.
This magazine and book publisher said 0 three men were elected *-1 *PRO*-2 directors, *PRO* increasing the board to 10.
They are: James R. Eiszner, 62 years old and chairman and chief executive officer of CPC International Inc.; Robert G. Schwartz, 61, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and Walter V. Shipley, 53, chairman and chief executive officer of Chemical Banking Corp.

PUTS AND CALLS, STOCK MARKET PATOIS for options *PRO* to sell or buy a company's shares, were long an arcane Wall Street art best left * to the experts, who *T*-1 used them either as a hedge or for pure speculation.
Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange 0 *T*-1 to deal in them *T*-2.
Until then, options had been traded *-1 only in the over - the - counter market, mostly in New York, and in an almost invisible secondary market operating chiefly by telephone.
The Chicago Board of Trade, the No. 1 U.S. grain market, had long chafed under the attention won * by its innovative archrival, the livestock - dealing Mercantile Exchange.
So the men who *T*-1 ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan, a 35 - year - old former Wall Street Journal newsman, offered them the idea of all - options trading *T*-2.
After four year of tinkering and $2.4 million *U* in seed money, the board set up the new marketplace, titled it *PRO*-1 the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and named Sullivan *PRO*-2 its first president.
The beginnings were modest.
The CBOE opened for business on April 26, 1973, in what *T*-1 had been a Board of Trade lunchroom.
It listed just 16 options *PRO* to buy a "pilot list" of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
(Puts, or sell options, would not be added *-1 until 1977.)
The 282 members had paid $10,000 *U* apiece for seats.
(The 1989 price: $250,000 *U*.)
The first day's business was 911 contracts (each for 100 shares of one of the listed stocks).
By the end of 1973, the number of "underlying" Big Board stocks had been increased *-1 to 50 and the options exchange had run up volume of 1.1 million contracts.
A year later, it was 5.7 million.
Last year, more than 1,800 traders on the CBOE bought and sold 112 million contracts on 178 listed stocks, 60% of all U.S. listed options trading.
The new exchange drew instant recognition from an unwelcome quarter.
The government, *PRO*-1 campaigning against fixed brokerage commissions, promptly sued the CBOE over its minimum - fee system.

Renault and DAF Trucks NV announced a preliminary agreement *PRO* to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in Britain and France.
Philippe Gras, a Renault managing director, said 0 the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built *-1 at Renault's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF's British plant.
The French state - controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan *PRO*-1 to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s *T*-2.
Mr. Gras said 0 he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed *-2 in the next few months.
The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for *PRO* eliminating trade barriers within the European Community.
Renault and DAF are expected *-1 to invest a total of about three billion French francs ($157.8 million *U*) *ICH*-2 in the venture, including FFr 1 billion *U* for design and development costs.
In addition, the companies will each spend about FFr 1 billion *U* on *PRO*-1 tooling up their plants.
Mr. Gras said 0 the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF, since both companies would in any case have had *-1 to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles.
By *PRO*-3 pooling their resources, the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that *T*-1 would otherwise have been entailed *-4, he said 0 *T*-2.
Renault officials said 0 the potential European market for light trucks in the 2.5 - ton to 4.2 - ton range is between 700,000 and 800,000 vehicles annually, and Renault and DAF are aiming for a combined market share of about 11%.
Both Renault and DAF will have world - wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks.
Under a separate arrangement, British Aerospace PLC's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able *PRO*-1 to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K., and Renault's truck - building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France.
DAF is 16% - owned by British Aerospace, with a further 6.5% held * by the Dutch state - owned chemical group NV DSM.
The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11% of DAF's capital.

Outside the white - walled headquarters of the socalled Society of Orange Workers, all seems *-1 normal in South Africa's abnormal society.
A pickup truck driven * by a white farmer rumbles past with a load of black workers bouncing in the back.
Over at Conradies, the general store, a black stock boy scurries *PRO*-1 to help an elderly white woman with her packages.
Down the street, a car pulls into the Shell station and is surrounded *-1 by black attendants.
But inside the white walls of the Orange Workers' office--just about the largest building in town, save for the Dutch Reformed Church and the school--South Africa's neat racial order is awry.
A dozen white office workers fold newsletters and stuff them into envelopes.
White women serve tea and coffee, and then wash the cups and saucers afterwards.
White children empty the wastepaper baskets and squeegee the windows.
There isn't a black worker in sight.
Not in the kitchen, or the storeroom or the book shop.
"If we want *PRO*-1 to have our own nation, then we must be willing *PRO*-2 to do all the work ourselves," says *T*-3 Hendrik Verwoerd Jr., son of the former prime minister and the leader of the Orange Workers, founded * in 1980.
They do indeed want their own nation.
The pillars of apartheid may be trembling in the rest of South Africa, with Johannesburg opening its public facilities to all races, blacks storming the all - white beaches of the Cape and the government releasing seven leaders of the banned African National Congress.
But here in Morgenzon, a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal, the Orange Workers are holding the pillars *PRO*-1 steady.
The Orange Workers--who *T*-1 take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands, a hero of the Dutch - descended Afrikaners--believe that the solution to South Africa's racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid--complete and total separation of the races.
Here, then, is *T*-3 where the Orange Workers have come *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to make apartheid's last stand.
Their idea is *PRO* to create a city, first, and then an entire nation--without blacks.
This may seem *-1 to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa.
And the fact that there are only 3,000 card - carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe.
But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland, an all - white reserve 0 *T*-3 to be carved *-1 out of present - day South Africa, is a mainstream desire of the right - wing, which *T*-2 embraces about one - third of the country's five million whites.
Afrikaner philosophers and theologians have long ruminated on the need for a white homeland.
The Orange Workers are just putting this preaching into practice.
Thus, farmer Johan Fischer, his T - shirt and jeans covered *-1 in grease, crawls around under his planter, *PRO*-2 tightening bolts and fixing dents.
On almost every other farm in South Africa, black workers do the repairs.
But not here.
Mr. Fischer plows his own fields, sows his own corn and sunflowers, and feeds his own sheep.
Over at the fiberglass factory, four white workers assemble water tanks on their own, and in their spare time they build townhouses across the road.
On Main Street, Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop, then hurry home *PRO*-1 to fix lunch for the rest of the family.
Down by the stream, a group of Orange Workers puts the finishing touches on a golf course.
If whites want *PRO*-1 to play there by themselves, says 0 *?* consulting engineer Willem van Heerden, whites should also build it by themselves.
"If we want *PRO*-1 to survive as a people," he says *?*, "we have *-3 to change our way of life.
The Afrikaner must end his reliance on others."
In their quest *PRO* to perfect apartheid, the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily *PRO*-3 to deny *T*-1: The master can't become dependent on the slave and expect *PRO*-2 to remain master forever.
"If apartheid means 0 you want cheap black labor and all the comforts that *T*-1 go with it, but you also want *PRO*-3 to exclude the blacks from social and political integration, then these are two contradictions that *T*-2 can't go on forever," says *T*-4 Mr. Verwoerd.
He is sitting in his living room, beneath a huge portrait of his late father, Hendrik F. Verwoerd, apartheid's architect and South African prime minister from 1958 to 1966.
Somewhere, the son sighs 0 *?*, things went terribly wrong with apartheid; today, whites even rely on blacks to police their separation.
"People took separate development as an opportunity *PRO* to use black labor without *PRO*-1 ever getting rid of it.
But my father meant it to mean real separation," says *T*-1 the son.
The Orange Workers speak sincerely.
"We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong," says *T*-1 Pieter Bruwer, the Orange Workers' chief scribe and pamphleteer.
"We must either integrate honestly or segregate honestly."
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom.
According to Mr. Verwoerd, the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people 0 *T*-1 to settle in the eastern Transvaal, even before the blacks.
Then, when Morgenzon was incorporated *-1 in 1908 *T*-3, the farmer who *T*-2 owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town; blacks could work there, but they had *-4 to leave at night.
Today, Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads.
Weeds push up through the cracks in the sidewalks, and many houses and storefronts are empty.
There are few factories and no mines.
It *EXP*-3 was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation, *PRO*-2 unencumbered by the demographics that *T*-1 have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa.
So far, about 150 Orange Workers have moved here, *PRO*-1 spending nearly $1 million *U* *PRO*-2 buying up property over the past three years.
Still, complete and total segregation remains elusive.
Just beyond the city limits is *T*-3 a shantytown of 2,000 blacks who *T*-2 are employed *-1 throughout the area.
Despite the Orange Workers' intention *PRO* to put them all out of work, they are in no hurry *PRO* to leave.
A young man called * *PRO*-6 July (that's when he was born *-1 *T*-4), who *T*-2 works at the railroad station just up the street from the Orange Workers office, points at the whitewalled building and says matter - of - factly, "We're not allowed *-5 in there, that's all 0 I know *T*-3."
The 650 - or - so local whites who *T*-1 aren't Orange Workers are more troubled.
*PRO*-1 Try as they might *?*, they just can't conceive of life without black workers.
"Impossible, impossible," say *T*-2 the Conradies, an elderly couple who *T*-1 have run the general store for decades.
"We can't do without their help," says *T*-1 Mrs. Conradie.
"Oh no.
We need them and I thank God for them."
Over at the Shell station, owner Rudi van Dyk, who *T*-1 doubles as Morgenzon's mayor, worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation.
"What they want us to do *T*-1 just isn't practical," he says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 noting that he employs 16 blacks.
"I couldn't afford *PRO*-1 to hire 16 whites.
The only Afrikaners who *T*-1 would be willing *PRO*-2 to work for this salary wouldn't know how *PRO* to handle money *T*-3."
Back at the Verwoerd house, Hendrik Sr. peers down over the shoulder of Hendrik Jr.
The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize 0 there is no *PRO* turning back the integration of South African society and politics *T*-1, Morgenzon will boom.
"We urge our people *PRO*-3 not to wait until they have *-1 to fight for their own nation," says *T*-2 Mr. Verwoerd.
"By *PRO*-3 populating a place now, we make ourselves a power 0 any new government will have *-2 to take *T*-1 into account."
Curiously, he compares the Orange Workers to the ANC, which his father outlawed *T*-1 in 1960.
"The ANC won't be stopped *-1 until there is a provision for black aspirations," says *T*-2 Mr. Verwoerd.
"Likewise, no government will stop this idea of the Afrikaners."
He apologizes for *PRO*-1 sounding pushy.
"*PRO* Look," he says *?*, "If the rest of South Africa wants *PRO*-1 to have an integrated melting pot, that's their choice.
We'll leave them alone.
We just want *PRO*-1 to have our own cup of tea."
And they will even serve it themselves.
USX Corp. declined a United Steelworkers request for a reopening of its four - year labor contract that *T*-1 is due *-2 to expire Jan. 31, 1991.
The union on Oct. 5 requested that the contract be reopened *-88 *PRO* to restore all pay and benefits that the union gave *T*-1 up in the 1982 - 83 and 1986 - 87 rounds of bargaining.
A United Steelworkers spokeman said 0 Lynn Williams, the union's president, was out of town.
The union won't respond to the USX statement until Mr. Williams has studied it, the spokesman said 0 *T*-1.

PLASTIC PENCILS, CODE - NAMED *PRO* *PRO*-72 E - 71, made their hush - hush debut in children's pencil boxes at five - and - dime stores in 1973.
But few knew it then and most still think 0 all pencils are wooden.
Eagle Pencil of Shelbyville, Tenn., "Pencil City U.S.A.," had made its earliest pilot plastic pencils in 1971.
But it wasn't until after it hired Arthur D. Little, a Cambridge, Mass., research concern, that its new product was refined *-1 for commercial sale in 1973 *T*-2.
Three A.D.L. inventors applied April 6, 1973, for the patent, which *T*-2 was assigned and awarded *-1 in 1976 to Hasbro Industries, then Eagle's parent.
Pencil pushers chew *RNR*-1 and put *RNR*-1 *ICH*-2 the plastic models behind their ears just like traditional pencils made * of glued strips of California incense cedar filled * with ceramic lead.
It *EXP*-1 takes five steps *PRO* to make standard pencils, just one for the plastic type.
Automated machines coextrude long plastic sheaths with graphite - plastic cores that *T*-1 are printed, cut, painted and eraser - fitted *-2.
"After more than 200 years, something new has happened to pencils," said *T*-2 Arthur D. Little in a 1974 report that *T*-1 publicly described the previously secret item.
Eagle's plastic type sharpens and looks like a wooden pencil.
A major difference is that a snapped wooden pencil will have a slivered break while a plastic model will break cleanly.
The softness of the core constrains the plastic models to No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3 - type pencils, which *T*-1 account for the bulk of the market.
Artists and draftsmen need harder "leads."
Eagle, now called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Eagle - Berol, remains a leading company among the 10 in the U.S. that *T*-1 produced about 2.3 billion pencils last year, according to the Pencil Makers Association.
It *EXP*-3's a trade secret how many *T*-1 were plastic, and most writers still don't know what they're using *T*-2.

Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union, Mexico's most powerful labor organization, only last January.
But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known * as La Quina.
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari used the army *PRO*-3 to oust La Quina, who *T*-1 reigned for 28 years over a graft - riddled empire that *T*-2 made state - run Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, one of the world's most inefficient oil companies.
Now, Mr. Guzman Cabrera is facing accusations that he's as much a company man as La Quina was a crook.
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management, Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that *T*-1 greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings.
And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina, government technocrats have been given *-1 a free hand 0 *PRO* to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment *T*-2.
Mr. Guzman Cabrera's new order hasn't arrived without resistance.
Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations.
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas publicly questioned Mr. Guzman Cabrera's "moral quality," *PRO*-1 suggesting 0 he is part of a conspiracy *PRO* to turn over the country's oil, a symbol of Mexican nationalism, to foreigners.
The 61 - year - old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride.
"This isn't a new kind of union leadership, it's a new Mexico.
We're no longer afraid of *PRO*-2 associating with private or foreign capital," he says *T*-1.
Pemex, which *T*-1 produces 40% of government revenue, desperately needs new investment.
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982, the government has siphoned Pemex's coffers *PRO*-1 to make payments on Mexico's $97 billion *U* foreign debt.
*T*-1 Little money has been returned *-2 0 *PRO* to upgrade Pemex's aging facilities *T*-3.
While the government drains Pemex from above, the union has drained it from below.
A bloated payroll and pervasive graft caused Pemex's operating costs to balloon to 95 cents of each $1 *U* in sales, far above the industry norm.
The declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why Mexico has been importing gasoline this year *T*-1.
Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century, barring an overhaul of operations.
"Whatever you tried *PRO*-3 to change *T*-1, whether it was *PRO* cutting costs or attracting new partners, the big obstacle was the old union leadership," says *T*-2 oil consultant George Baker.
*PRO* Enter Mr. Guzman Cabrera, who *T*-1 has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the pro-enterprise regime of President Salinas *T*-2.
"I'm the secretary - general, if there is one," he says *T*-1, *PRO*-2 greeting a visitor to his office.
*PRO*-2 Beginning as a laborer in a refinery, Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before *PRO*-2 being pushed *-1 into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago.
Though he also long benefited from the system built * by La Quina, Mr. Guzman Cabrera says 0 union perks had simply gotten out of hand.
They are "at the base of all of the problems of corruption," he says 0 *T*-1.
Thus, in recent contract negotiations, Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union's right *PRO* to assign 40% of all of Pemex's outside contracts--an enormous source of kickbacks.
The union also ceded the 2% commission 0 it had received *T*-1 on all Pemex maintenance contracts.
(The union will keep a 2% commission on construction projects.)
The new contract also eliminates the $15 *U* monthly coupon, good only at union - owned grocery stores, that *T*-1 was part of the salary of every worker, from roughneck to chief executive.
About 9,800 technical workers, notably chemists and lawyers, were switched *-1 to non-union status.
Also, because of its reduced capital budget, Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, *PRO* reducing the work force to about 140,000, the union leader says 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says 0 the union's sacrifices will be offset *-1 by a wage and benefit package that *T*-2 amounts to a 22% increase in compensation.
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled * by the contract.
"We are retaking the instruments of administration," says *T*-1 Raul Robles, a Pemex subdirector.
Pemex officials wouldn't say how much money the new contract would save the company *T*-1, but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $500 million *U* a year.
Pemex's customers also are pleased *-1 with the company's new spirit.
Grupo Desc, a big conglomerate, has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals *PRO*-1 to produce plastic packing material.
But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul *T*-1, it would never give notice to its customers.
"The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations," says *T*-1 Ernesto Vega Velasco, Desc's finance director.
This year, for the first time, Desc and other customers were consulted *-1 well in advance of the Pemex plant's shutdown *PRO* to ensure minimal inconvenience.
*PRO* Taming the union complements previous moves *ICH*-1 by the government *PRO* to attract private investment in petrochemicals, which Mexico has been forced *-3 *PRO*-4 to import *T*-2 in large quantities in recent years.
In May, the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that *T*-1 create special trusts allowing foreigners, long limited * to a 40% stake in secondary petrochemical companies, to own up to 100%.
Later, the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products.
But Pemex's courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized *-1 in 1938 *T*-2.
"They are preparing the workers for what *T*-1's coming: foreign control," wrote *T*-2 Heberto Castillo, a leftist leader.
Mr. Guzman Cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited *-1 to *PRO*-1 investing in secondary petroleum products.
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex's more outward - looking attitude.
"If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence, sooner or later we're going *-2 to become victims of our own isolation," he says *T*-1.
Michael F. Harris, 53, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 executive vice president, North America, for the Financial Times, the business newspaper published * by this company that *T*-2 also has interests in book publishing, fine china, oil services and investment banking.
Mr. Harris had been vice president for the newspaper's advertising in New York.
He takes additional responsibility for newspaper sales and distribution of the Financial Times in North America.
Laurance V. Allen, 44, who *T*-1 had been director for North America, resigned *PRO*-2 to pursue other business interests and do some consulting.
Combustion Engineering Inc., Stamford, Conn., said 0 it sold *RNR*-2 *RNR*-5 and agreed *PRO*-1 to sell *RNR*-2 *RNR*-5 several investments and nonstrategic businesses for about $100 million *U*, which *T*-4 will be used *-3 for *PRO* reducing debt and general purposes.
The transactions are unrelated.
The company agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its minority investments in makers of steam - generating and related equipment, Stein Industrie and Energie & Verfahrenstechnik, to the major shareholder in the companies, Dutch - based GEC Alsthom N.V.
Combustion Engineering, which *T*-1 provides engineered products, systems and services for power generation, also sold Illinois Minerals Co., based * in Cairo, Ill.
That unit of its Georgia Kaolin Co. subsidiary was sold *-1 to a unit of Unimin Corp.
Assets of Construction Equipment International, Houston, were sold *-1 to Essex Crane Inc., and the assets of Elgin Electronics, Erie, Pa., were sold *-2 to closely held Charter Technologies Inc.
Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd. said 0 the third - quarter combined profit of its six gold mines dropped 8.5% from the previous quarter.
Total net income fell to 471.6 million rand ($178.0 million *U*) from 515.4 million rand in the June quarter.
Total gold production by all six mines rose 4% to 63,971 kilograms from 61,493 kilograms in the previous quarter.
Hotel Investors Trust and its affiliate, Hotel Investors Corp., said 0 the companies plan *PRO*-2 to sell all of the hotels 0 the companies own and operate *T*-1, except for two hotel - casinos in Las Vegas, Nev.
The hotels and management interests will be sold *-1 at an auction, said 0 *T*-2 John Rothman, president and chief executive officer of the trust and a director of the corporation.
Value of the properties and management interests wasn't disclosed *-1.
In all, the Los Angeles - based trust plans *PRO*-1 to sell its interests in 36 hotels, while the corporation will sell its management interests in 32 of those properties.
Excluded *-1 from the sale are *T*-2 the interests of the trust and the corporation in two Las Vegas hotel - casinos.
After *PRO*-1 completing the sale and paying debts, the trust and corporation will consider a number of options including a stock repurchase, payment of special dividend or investment in more gaming properties.
The companies will retain their current regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents during the sale process, Mr. Rothman said 0 *T*-1.
For the first six months, the trust and corporation had a net loss of $244,000 *U*.
Slowing sales of its profitable Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer sport utility vehicles are forcing Chrysler Corp. *PRO*-1 to temporarily idle its Toledo, Ohio, assembly plant for the first time since April 1986.
About 5,500 hourly workers will be laid *-3 off for a week beginning Oct. 23, and overtime has been eliminated *-1 at the plant for the fourth quarter, a Chrysler spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
That's a significant change from earlier this year when the plant worked substantial overtime *T*-2 only *PRO*-1 to have sales fall short of the company's bullish expectations.
Sales of Cherokee, the best - selling Jeep, and the lower - volume Wagoneer were actually up about 10% through the end of last month.
But that's less than Chrysler officials had hoped when they set ambitious production schedules for the Toledo plant earlier this year *T*-1.
Even when it *EXP*-2 became clear this spring that demand wasn't coming up to expectations *T*-1, Chrysler officials "resisted" *PRO*-4 cutting output because Cherokee and Wagoneer are "very profitable vehicles," the spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
Instead, Chrysler officials in late May slapped $1,000 *U* cash rebates *ICH*-1 on the vehicles, including the first such incentives on the popular four - door Cherokee since Chrysler bought Jeep in 1987.
The incentives boosted sales for a while, but the pace had cooled by last month.
The result: Chrysler dealers had a bloated 82 - day supply of the Cherokee as of the end of last month and a 161 - day supply of the Comanche pickup, which Toledo also builds *T*-1.
A 60 - day to 65 - day supply is considered *-1 normal.
At Jasper Jeep - Eagle, one of the largest Jeep dealerships in the country, inventories have continued *-1 to swell.
Steve Lowe, general manager of Jasper, Ga., dealership, said 0 new rebates of $500 to $1,000 *U* on the models have stimulated sales *NOT*, but not enough *PRO* to significantly cut dealer stocks.
"If people aren't buying, you have *-1 to close plants," he said *T*-2.
Separately, Chrysler said 0 it will idle for four weeks the St. Louis assembly plant that *T*-1 builds the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models.
Chrysler officials said 0 the plant is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to resume production on Nov. 20., and 3,300 hourly workers will be affected *-1.
General Motors Corp., meanwhile, said 0 it will idle for yet another week its Linden, N.J., assembly plant, *PRO* bringing to three weeks the total time 0 that plant will be idled *-1 during October *T*-2.
GM said 0 the assembly plant, which *T*-1 builds the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars, originally was scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to reopen Monday but now will not resume production until Oct. 30.
The shutdown affects 3,000 workers and will cut output by about 4,320 cars.
Sluggish sales of the Beretta and Corsica spurred GM *PRO*-1 to offer $800 *U* rebates on those cars.
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest - volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the cars are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34.2% early this month.
GM has scheduled overtime at its Lordstown, Ohio, and Janesville, Wis., assembly plants, which *T*-1 build the Chevrolet Cavalier.
Ford Motor Co. said 0 it will shut down for one week its Kentucky Truck Plant because of a "shortage of dealer orders."
The shutdown will idle 2,000 hourly employees and eliminate production of about 1,300 medium and heavy duty trucks.
The assembly plant is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to resume production on Oct. 30.
Meanwhile, the nine major U.S. auto makers plan *PRO*-1 to build 143,178 cars *ICH*-2 this week, down 11.7% from 162,190 a year ago and flat with last week's 142,117 car output.
f - Includes Chevrolet Prizm and Toyota Corolla.
r - Revised.
x - Year - to - date 1988 figure includes Volkswagen domestic - production through July.
TransAtlantic Holdings PLC, a British - based, South African - controlled financial services investment group, and France's Societe Centrale Union des Assurances de Paris reached an accord effectively reducing chances of an unfriendly takeover for Sun Life Assurance Society PLC.
In a joint statement, the two companies, whose combined holdings *T*-2 equal 52.7% of Sun Life's ordinary shares, said 0 their agreement is aimed *-1 at *PRO* reducing "the uncertainty and instability for Sun Life that *T*-3 has resulted from two major shareholders owning" a controlling interest in the company.
TransAtlantic, whose Transol Investments Ltd. unit *T*-1 owns the largest minority stake in Sun Life, has agreed *PRO*-2 not to make a takeover bid for the British life insurer without the prior consent of the French company, known * as UAP.
In return, the agreement would force UAP *PRO*-1 to buy TransAtlantic's 29.8% holding in Sun Life or sell its 22.9% stake to TransAtlantic at a price set * by Transatlantic.
Abortion - rights advocates won last week's battles, but the war over the nation's most - contentious social question is about *-2 to pick up again on turf that *T*-1 favors those seeking *PRO* to restrict abortions.
Strict new regulations seem *-1 certain *PRO*-2 to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week, with easy approval by the Senate and by Democratic Gov. Bob Casey expected * shortly thereafter.
Legislation 0 *T*-1 to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature and set up a grinding battle *PRO* to override the expected veto of Democratic Gov. James Blanchard.
The short - term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that *T*-1 are likely *-3 to govern the debate in the next several months: the reawakening of the abortion - rights movement as a potent force after years of lassitude, and the ability *ICH*-2 of each side *PRO* to counter the other's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere.
The action in Pennsylvania, for example, will follow last week's collapse of a special session of the Florida legislature 0 *T*-2 to enact restrictions on abortions in that state, and the vote *ICH*-3 here in Washington by the House *PRO* to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who *T*-1 are victims of rape or incest.
But President Bush is expected *-1 to veto the congressional legislation and that, along with the easy approval of the Pennsylvania measure, is likely *-2 to mute the abortion - rights activists' claims of momentum and underline the challenges faced * by this resurgent movement.
"It *EXP*-2's great *PRO* to feel good for once in 15 years," says *T*-1 Harrison Hickman, a consultant to abortion - rights advocates, *PRO*-3 reflecting the relief of his compatriots after last week's victories, the first major events since the Supreme Court, in its July 3 Webster decision, permitted the states *PRO*-4 to enact restrictions on abortions.
"But how many more times we're going *-2 to feel good in the next 15 *T*-1 is another question."
Indeed, abortion - rights activists still face their greatest tests.
"The pro-choice movement has shown--finally--that it can mobilize," says *T*-3 Glen Halva - Neubauer, a Furman University political scientist who *T*-1 specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question *T*-2.
"But it still hasn't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri, where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue *T*-1 and where it's been an emotional issue for a long time *T*-2."
The foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in Pennsylvania, where abortion - rights activists are so much *ICH*-1 on the defensive that their strategy is less *ICH*-4 *PRO* to fight the proposed legislation than it is *PRO* to stress how the state legislature doesn't reflect the viewpoints of the state's citizens *T*-2 *T*-3.
As a result, GOP state Rep. Stephen Freind of Delaware County, the legislature's leading foe of abortion, has been given *-1 all but free rein 0 *PRO* to press a strict seven - point plan *PRO* to restrict abortion *T*-3 and, he hopes 0 *T*-4, *PRO* to force the Supreme Court *PRO*-5 directly to reassess its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that *T*-2 established the right of abortion in the first place *T*-3.
The Freind legislation--the state's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected *-1 to take up the bill next Tuesday--includes a provision 0 *T*-2 to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except *PRO* to avert the death of the mother.
Mr. Freind calculates that the provision, which *T*-1 attacks the trimester standards that Roe established *T*-2, will "make it *EXP*-3 necessary" for the Supreme Court to review Roe and, perhaps, to overturn it.
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an "informed consent" provision that *T*-1 may become *PRO* widely imitated *-3 by abortion foes who *T*-2 want *PRO*-4 to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves.
Under this legislation, a woman must be informed *-1 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks.
"Regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion," Mr. Freind argues *?*, "it *EXP*-2 is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right *PRO* to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made *PRO*-4 available to her before she makes a decision which, one way or the other, *T*-3 might remain with her for the rest of her life."
In Michigan, where the state Senate is expected *-2 to approve parental - consent legislation by the end of next week *T*-1, Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists.
Susan Rogin, a consultant to abortion - rights activists in the state, takes comfort from the fact that the state's House abortion opponents "haven't been able *PRO*-2 to muster the votes 0 *PRO* to overturn a veto on abortion *T*-1 in 16 years."
But proponents believe 0 they may be able *PRO*-1 to shake enough votes *ICH*-2 *PRO*-4 loose *PRO* to override the veto if they are successful in *PRO*-3 portraying the legislation as a matter of parents' rights.
In Illinois, lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks *PRO*-1 to determine their gestational age, weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that, if fetuses survive an abortion, a second doctor must be on hand *PRO*-2 to help it survive.
The legislation failed by one vote *-1 to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday, but anti-abortionists still may succeed in *PRO*-2 bringing the measure to the floor this fall.
Pamela Sutherland, executive director of the Illinois Planned Parenthood Council, says 0 she and her allies are "cautiously optimistic" 0 they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote.
Abortion foes in Wisconsin, meanwhile, expect a parental - consent bill to be sent *-1 to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of *PRO*-2 prevailing in both houses by next March.
In Texas, abortion opponents want *PRO*-1 to pass parental - consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds, personnel and facilities for abortion, and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older.
The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements *PRO*-1 to press the issues in a special session scheduled *PRO* to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13.
"The prognosis is only fair," says *T*-1 Kathie Roberts, administrative director of the Texas Right to Life Committee.
"Next year is an election year and the legislators just don't want *PRO*-1 to do anything about this now."
This legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new mobilization efforts, plunging into gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, and girding for next autumn's state elections.
At the same time, abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy, *PRO*-3 deciding *PRO*-4 to move on what Jacki Ragan, the National Right to Life Committee's director of state organizational development, calls *T*-1 "*PRO*-5 reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of Americans support *T*-2."
These include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection, and the public funding of alternatives for abortion.
"Those who *T*-1 are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue *-2 to insist on *PRO*-4 calling themselves *PRO*-5 ` pro-choice' rather than ` pro-abortion,"' says *T*-3 Mary Spaulding, the group's associate state legislative coordinator.
Over the weekend, the National Abortion Rights Action League singled out eight politicians, including Pennsylvania's Mr. Freind, as 1990 targets and held a Washington seminar designed *PRO* to train its leaders in political techniques, including how *PRO* to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures *T*-1.
"We now see pro-choice legislators going on the offensive for the first time," says *T*-1 Kate Michelman, executive director of the group.
The Federal Reserve System is the standard object of suggestions for organizational and institutional changes, for two reasons.
First, its position in the government is anomalous.
It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government's instruments--the control of the money supply.
Thus we have a condition that *T*-2 is easily described *-1 as undemocratic.
Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency, which *T*-1 means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it *PRO*-3 to take measures that *T*-2 are unpopular.
As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used *-1 to say, they would have *-2 to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting.
So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians.
The Fed is easily assigned *-1 the blame for unpleasantness, like high interest rates or slow economic growth, while the politicians can escape responsibility by *PRO*-2 pointing to the Fed's independence.
This leads to proposals for "reform" of the Fed, which *T*-1 have the common feature of *PRO* making the Fed more responsive to the administration, to the Congress and to public opinion--without, however, any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians.
These proposals include *PRO* changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision - making process, putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board, having the Fed audited *-1 by an arm of Congress (the General Accounting Office), putting the Fed's expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the Fed's minutes.
Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress.
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed's problem is *T*-1 or, if they do *?*, they rest on an incorrect view.
They would not solve the problem; they would make it worse.
The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest.
On the contrary, it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest.
The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1/4 times as high as it was *?* 30 years ago.
On average, something that *T*-1 cost $100 *U* 30 years ago now costs $425 *U*.
Or, a wage that *T*-1 was $100 *U* 30 years ago would buy only $23.53 *U* worth of stuff today.
On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10% a year.
In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession--the two worst of the postwar period.
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy.
At least, it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that *T*-1 provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period.
And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve.
The basic problem of monetary policy, to which reform of the Fed should be addressed *-1 *T*-2, is *PRO* to prevent a recurrence of this experience.
There were two general reasons for the mistaken monetary policy of the past 30 years:
1 . To some extent the Federal Reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that expansionary monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output.
2 . Even where the Fed did not share this view *T*-1 it felt the need *PRO* to accommodate to it.
Despite all the formal provisions for its independence, the Fed seems constantly *-1 to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it.
The common proposals for *PRO* reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse, if they had any effect at all.
*PRO* Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors, one of the leading proposals today, is an example.
The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money.
He has a built - in, constant longing for lower interest rates.
Moreover, he is a political agent of a political president, who *T*-1 naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way 0 the economy will perform before the next election *T*-2, and less to its longer - run health.
These days, the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who *T*-1 meet occasionally *PRO*-4 to decide what exchange rates should be *T*-3, which *T*-2 is a diversion from the real business *ICH*-5 of the Federal Reserve *PRO* to stabilize the price level.
How should a reasonable member of the Federal Reserve Board interpret a congressional decision *PRO* to put the secretary on the board *T*-1?
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to *PRO* stabilizing the price level?
Or would he interpret it as instruction *PRO* to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents *T*-1--low interest rates, short - run economic expansion, and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels?
The answer seems *-1 perfectly clear.
(True, a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed.
By their constant readiness *PRO* to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew, in which case it *EXP*-2 is natural that the Fed and the Treasury, and probably also the Congress, should be jointly engaged *-1 in *PRO* stirring the pot *T*-3.
The Fed's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government.)
The Fed's problem is not that it is too independent, or too unpolitical.
The Fed is responsive to *RNR*-1, and cannot help *PRO*-2 being responsive to *RNR*-1, the more overtly political part of the government.
The Fed exercises a power given * to it by Congress and the president.
But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power 0 they have given the Fed *T*-1.
Critics of the present arrangement are correct *PRO*-1 to say that it is undemocratic.
What *T*-2 is undemocratic is the unwillingness *ICH*-5 of the more political parts of the government *PRO* to take the responsibility for *PRO* deciding the basic question of monetary policy, which *T*-3 is what priority *T*-4 should be given *-1 to *PRO* stabilizing the price level.
*PRO* To leave this decision to an "independent" agency is not only undemocratic.
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that *T*-1 has a long - term rationale, because it leaves the Fed *PRO*-5 guessing about what *T*-2 are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who *T*-3 have never had *-4 to consider the long - term consequences of monetary policy.
The greatest contribution 0 Congress could make *T*-1 at this time would be *PRO* to declare that *PRO* stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System.
Legislation to this effect has been introduced *-1 in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C .).
It is not the kind of thing that *T*-2 is likely *-3 to be enacted *-1, however.
Congress would be required *-1 *PRO*-3 to make a hard decision, and Congress would much prefer *PRO*-2 to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact.
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives, in addition to *PRO* stabilizing the price level, which *T*-1 is true.
But that is not the same as *PRO* saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives.
The government has other agencies and instruments for *PRO* pursuing these other objectives.
But it has only the Fed 0 *T*-1 to pursue price - level stability.
And the Fed has at most very limited ability *PRO* to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by *PRO* stabilizing the price level.
The two objectives most commonly thought *PRO* to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth.
But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price - stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation.
*PRO*-1 A former chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Stein is an American Enterprise Institute fellow.
A group bidding for American Medical International Inc., New York, said 0 it formally received the final financing needed * for a $3 billion *U* bid for about 86% of the hospital operator's stock.
The offer from IMA Acquisition Corp., for as many as 63 million shares, is set *PRO*-1 to expire Wednesday.
Earlier this month, IMA said 0 it had received about $1 billion *U* of senior debt financing from Chemical Bank and six other banks; Chemical Bank said 0 it was "highly confident" 0 it could arrange the balance of about $509 million *U*.
In addition, the $3 billion *U* bid includes $1 billion *U* of debt that *T*-3 will be assumed *-1 by IMA, $600 million *U* of high - yield junk bonds that *T*-4 will be sold *-2 by First Boston Corp. and $285 million *U* of equity.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Medical closed at $23.625 *U*, up $1.875 *U*.
American Medical has agreed to the offer, but earlier this month said 0 it had received new "expressions of interest" from two previous bidders.
American Medical said 0 it would pursue the inquiries from the companies, but wouldn't identify them unless they make firm offers.
Lonrho PLC of Britain is *-3 to come to the rescue of the French distribution group Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africaine in an operation that *T*-2 has been engineered *-1 with the Paribas financial group, Societe Commerciale's main shareholder.
The announcement came as Societe Commerciale, a trading company with activities in more than 40 countries, reported a loss of 320.5 million francs ($51 million *U*) for the first six months of this year, partly because of provisions on future losses.
The rescue operation will consist of a capital boost for Societe Commerciale of one billion francs through issues of new shares and convertible bonds.
Cie . Financiere de Paribas said 0 it intends *PRO*-3 to transfer its 30% shareholding in Societe Commerciale to a new company which *T*-2 will be jointly owned *-1 with Lonrho.
This will give Paribas and Lonrho joint control of Societe Commerciale.
Paribas said 0 Lonrho will participate in the forthcoming capital boost for Societe Commerciale.
The Federal National Mortgage Association said 0 39 lenders across the U.S. have agreed *PRO*-1 to offer home loans under Fannie Mae's pilot program for elderly people.
Fannie Mae, a federally chartered and shareholder - owned company, said 0 the lenders include Prudential Home Mortgage Co., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America that *T*-1 operates in every state.
Prudential Insurance is based *-1 in Newark, N.J.
Fannie Mae has agreed *PRO*-2 to buy as much as $100 million *U* of loans under its Seniors' Housing Opportunities pilot program, which *T*-1 offers four types of loans to people 62 years of age or older *PRO*-3 to help them maintain their home or obtain housing.
The loans can be for accessory apartments, for cottages built * in a relative's yard, for home - sharing or for sale - lease - back transactions.
Fannie Mae makes a secondary market in home loans.
It buys loans from lenders, packages some into securities for sale to investors and holds the remainder in a portfolio.
The French building group Dumez S.A. said 0 profit jumped 70% in the first half of 1989, partly on the strength of nonrecurring gains from a share issue by its Canadian unit.
Dumez said 0 group profit after payments to minority interests rose to 252 million francs ($40.1 million *U*) from 148 million a year earlier.
Revenue rose 40% to 13.32 billion francs from 9.53 billion.
The group noted that 75 million francs of the advance reflected a one - time gain from the June offering by its United Westburne unit in Canada.
It didn't say if its year - earlier results were influenced *-1 significantly by nonrecurring elements.
For all of 1988, Dumez had group profit of 452 million francs after payment to minority interests.
Revenue was 21.98 billion francs.
The group hasn't forecast full - year earnings for 1989, although it said that its first - half results aren't a good indication because of one - time elements and the seasonal nature of its operations.
Gold and silver broker Preston Semel asked a federal court *PRO*-1 to halt the Commodity Exchange from *PRO*-2 imposing a record $550,000 *U* fine on his firm.
The suit, filed * in federal court in Manhattan, also asks that the Comex's nine - month suspension of Mr. Semel be lifted *-1, pending the broker's appeal of the disciplinary measures.
The fine and suspension, announced * in August, are the stiffest sanctions 0 the Comex has ever ordered *T*-1 against one of its members.
The Comex accused the 39 - year - old Mr. Semel of "fraudulent conduct" and improper trading.
The disciplinary proceedings stem from trading in April 1987.
Mr. Semel and his firm, Semel & Co., have appealed the Comex decision and the sanctions to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The commission denied Mr. Semel's request that the fine and suspension be delayed *-1 pending the appeal.
The lawsuit states that unless the sanctions are halted *-1 pending an appeal, the broker and his firm "will be irreparably injured *-3 and their business will be totally and permanently destroyed *-2."
Already the firm has paid $211,666 *U* of the fine, the suit said 0 *?*, and it will have *-1 to liquidate additional assets in order *PRO*-3 to pay the rest.
A spokesman for the Comex couldn't be reached *-1 *PRO*-1 to comment.
Aussedat Rey S.A., a French paper producer, said 0 it concluded an agreement with Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. that *T*-1 will allow Aussedat Rey to manufacture and sell thermal paper *PRO*-2 using Fuji technology.
Aussedat Rey is a leading French maker of copying and electronic printing paper.
Thermal paper is used *-1 in facsimile machines.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed *-1.
Aussedat Rey's move follows similar technology - licensing agreements between Japanese producers of thermal paper and European paper groups.

China said 0 the question of Taiwan's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be considered *-1 only after China's own membership in the 97 - nation organization is restored *-2.
Both China and Taiwan are seeking seats in GATT, which *T*-1 sponsors trade - liberalizing agreements and sets world - commerce rules.
"As one of China's provinces, Taiwan has no right *PRO* to join GATT on its own," Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said *T*-1.
China, under the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai - shek, was a founding member of GATT in 1947.
The Nationalists withdrew in 1950, after their flight to Taiwan, and the Communist government in Beijing applied for restoration of China's membership in July 1986.
The U.S. has voiced opposition to China's bid for GATT membership, *PRO*-2 saying 0 China has yet *-1 to undertake needed economic reforms.
Japan's biggest women's underwear maker, Wacoal Corp., said that it developed a sports car that it plans *PRO*-2 to market *T*-1 in two years.

"Now, we're going *-1 to sell to men."
The British satirical magazine Private Eye won an appeal against the size of a $960,000 *U* libel award to Sonia Sutcliffe, the estranged wife of the "Yorkshire Ripper" mass murderer.
An appeals - court panel slashed all but $40,000 *U* from the award, the largest ever set * by a British jury, pending a reassessment of the damages.
But the panel dismissed the magazine's contention that it hadn't libeled Mrs. Sutcliffe when it accused her of *PRO*-3 trying *PRO*-1 to sell her story *PRO*-1 to capitalize on the notoriety of her husband *T*-2.
Private Eye had been threatened *-1 with closure because it couldn't afford the libel payment.
Senshukai Co., a travel agent based * in Osaka, Japan, announced that it and Nissho Iwai Corp., a major Japanese trading house, will jointly build a 130 - unit condominium in Queensland, Australia.
Senshukai said 0 the partners plan *PRO*-1 to rent to tourists but will also sell to interested parties.
Senshukai has a 60% stake in the venture and Nissho Iwai has the rest.

A former vice president of the Singapore branch of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. was charged *-1 in court yesterday on 19 counts of cheating.
Francis Dang, 41, is alleged *PRO*-1 to have been involved *-2 in *PRO* cheating Drexel Burnham Lambert of up to 2.1 million Singapore dollars (US$1.1 million *U*) by *PRO*-3 carrying out unauthorized transactions on the London Commodities Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange.
Mr. Dang is alleged *PRO*-1 to have used the account of Singapore hotel and property magnate Ong Beng Seng *PRO*-2 to effect the transactions.
Japan says 0 its economic growth will fall sharply if it cuts back on the use of oil, coal and gas *PRO*-1 to cap emissions of carbon dioxide.
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said that a study found that Japan's annual economic growth rate would eventually be only 0.8% if carbon - dioxide emissions remained at this year's level of 300 million tons.
The study will support arguments against *PRO* capping carbon - dioxide emissions that Japan will make *T*-1 at a U.N. - backed conference on atmospheric pollution next month.
The study said 0 Japan's carbon - dioxide emissions would slightly more than double by 2010 unless the nation reduced its dependence on fossil fuels.
It said that *PRO* expanding nuclear - power capability is the quickest way 0 *PRO* to lessen that dependence *T*-1.

In New Zealand's tiny township of Kaitaia, which *T*-1 has had direct dialing for less than a year, about 30 angry phone - company customers questioned the size of their bills.

The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved a bill that *T*-1 would give the Transportation Department power *PRO* to block airline leveraged buy - outs, despite a clear veto threat from the Bush administration.
The 23 - 5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in a letter to the committee, warned that he would urge President Bush *PRO*-1 to veto the legislation if it passed Congress.
The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation.
On Monday, a letter from Mr. Skinner's deputy, Elaine Chao, said 0 the administration opposed the legislation "in its present form."
Some of the bill's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter wasn't signed *-1 by Mr. Skinner and that it didn't contain a veto threat.
The stepped - up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers, especially senior Republicans who *T*-1 supported the bill because they thought 0 the Transportation Department favored it.
"We backed this bill because we thought 0 it would help Skinner," one Republican said *?*, "and now we're out there *PRO*-1 dangling in the wind."
A few weeks ago, Mr. Skinner testified before Congress that it would be "cleaner, more efficient" if he had authority *PRO* to block buy - outs in advance.
But he never took an official position on the bill and has steadfastly maintained that he already has enough authority *PRO* to deal with buy - outs.
Under the committee bill, the Transportation secretary would have 30 days, and an additional 20 days if *PRO* needed *-2, *PRO*-1 to review any proposed purchase of 15% or more of a major U.S. airline's voting stock.
The secretary would be required *-1 *PRO*-2 to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier's ability *PRO* to compete, or if it gave control to a foreign interest.
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline, it is aimed *-1 at transactions financed * by large amounts of debt.
Supporters of the bill are concerned 0 an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order *PRO*-1 to repay debt.
The panel's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy - out proposals, their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market.
"It *EXP*-1 became apparent in hearings that there ought *PRO* to be regulation of leveraged buy - outs of some sort," Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee, said *T*-2 during the panel's deliberations.
"I don't believe 0 in the airline business you can be totally laissez - faire because of the high degree of public interest" at stake.
But Mr. Skinner disagreed, *PRO*-1 calling the legislation "*PRO*-2 a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry."
In his letter to Committee Chairman Glenn Anderson (D., Calif.), the secretary also said 0 the bill "would be at odds with the administration's policies welcoming open foreign investment and market allocation of resources."
Currently, the Transportation Department doesn't have the authority *PRO* to block a takeover in advance.
However, if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit *PRO*-1 to operate, the department may revoke its certificate, *PRO*-2 grounding the airline.
Such authority is more than adequate, say 0 *T*-1 opponents of the legislation.
But supporters argue that *PRO* grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate *PRO*-1 doing it.
The panel rejected a proposal *ICH*-2 pushed * by AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, *PRO* to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from *PRO*-3 waging proxy fights *PRO*-4 to oust boards that *T*-1 oppose a leveraged buy - out.
It also voted down proposals *PRO* to give the secretary much more discretion on whether *PRO* to block a buy - out and to require the department *PRO*-1 to consider the impact of a buy - out on workers.
The federal response to California's earthquake crisis was marred *-1 by coast - to - coast name - calling between the White House and San Francisco's Mayor Art Agnos.
Mr. Agnos complained that he was "ticked *-1 off" that Vice President Dan Quayle, who *T*-2 toured the earthquake site Wednesday, didn't schedule a private meeting with him.
The mayor said 0 the Quayle visit was "a publicity stunt."
The White House said 0 Mr. Quayle's staff had invited the mayor to two meetings of the vice president and groups of local officials and had offered *PRO*-1 to dispatch a helicopter *PRO*-2 to pick him up.
Mr. Agnos declined the invitations, the White House said 0 *T*-1.
Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, also asserted that Mr. Agnos had failed *-1 to return telephone calls from John Sununu, White House chief of staff.
"We regret very much that the mayor of San Francisco has decided *PRO*-1 not to cooperate with us on this matter in *PRO* making sure that there is adequate federal support for the disaster in his city," Mr. Fitzwater said *T*-2.
By late yesterday, both sides appeared *-1 prepared *PRO*-2 to bury the hatchet.
The White House announced that Mr. Agnos, along with the mayors of Oakland and Alameda, are *-1 to accompany President Bush on a tour of the earthquake area today.
And one White House official reported that Mr. Agnos had been "very helpful" in *PRO*-1 making arrangements for Mr. Bush's hastily scheduled trip to California.
HealthVest said 0 two of its lenders have given it notices of default on bank loans and said 0 they may take actions 0 *PRO* to recover their loans *T*-1.
HealthVest, an Austin, Texas, real estate investment trust, said that Chemical Bank, the lead bank under its domestic bank agreement, told it that if $3.3 million *U* owed * to the bank group isn't paid *-2 by today, the group will call the $120 million *U* that HealthVest has *T*-1 outstanding under the credit line.
The bank group also said that it won't make additional advances under the $150 million *U* credit line.
HealthVest missed a payment to the group that *T*-1 was due in late September.
In addition, HealthVest said 0 Bank of Tokyo Trust Co. also has notified it of a default and said 0 it might take action *PRO*-1 to cure the default.
HealthVest missed an interest payment to Bank of Tokyo on Oct. 1.
However, HealthVest said 0 the Tokyo bank indicated that it won't accelerate HealthVest's $50 million *U* loan.
HealthVest is in a severe liquidity bind because its affiliate, Healthcare International Inc., has failed *-1 to make about $10.6 million *U* in principal and interest payments owed * since August.
Healthcare operates many of the health - care properties that HealthVest owns *T*-1.
The U.S. Export - Import Bank tentatively decided *PRO*-1 to guarantee commercial bank financing for the purchase of two Boeing Co. 767 airliners by Avianca, Colombia's international airline, at a cost of about $150 million *U*.
The loan guarantee would amount to about $127.5 million *U*, or 85% of the cost of the aircraft.
Because of the size of the proposed loan guarantee, the Ex - Im Bank's preliminary commitment is subject to review by the House and Senate Banking committees.
Ex - Im Bank officials said 0 this review process currently is under way.
International Business Machines Corp. will announce on Tuesday a slew of software products aimed * at *PRO* eliminating some of the major problems involved in *PRO* computerizing manufacturing operations, industry executives said 0 *T*-1.
Many plant floors currently resemble a Tower of Babel, with computers, robots and machine tools that *T*-1 generally speak their own language and have trouble *PRO*-2 talking to each other.
As a result, if a problem develops on a production line, it *EXP*-1 is unlikely 0 some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able *PRO*-2 to correct it.
So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that *T*-2 will be aimed *-1 at *PRO* letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe, or anything in between.
In an unusual display of openness, IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that *T*-1 include lots of equipment made * by IBM's competitors.
In addition, the executives said 0 IBM will be offering programming tools designed *PRO* to let anyone working on a factory floor write ad - hoc software, for instance, 0 *T*-2 to do statistical analysis that *T*-1 would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line.
In Armonk, N.Y., an IBM spokeswoman confirmed that IBM executives will be announcing some computer - integrated - manufacturing plans next week but declined *PRO*-1 to elaborate.
The industry executives said that, as usual with such broad announcements from IBM, this one will be part reality and part strategy.
So it *EXP*-2 will take many quarters for IBM to roll out all the products that customers need *T*-1, and it *EXP*-3 will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations.
Also as usual, the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of IBM equipment, at least initially.
Still, consultants and industry executives said 0 the products could help *PRO*-1 make manufacturing operations more efficient, and provide a boost to the computer - integrated - manufacturing market--a market that Yankee Group, a research firm, has said 0 *T*-2 may double to $40 billion *U* by 1993.
"This is a step in the right direction," said *T*-1 Martin Piszczalski, a Yankee Group analyst.
He added, though, that "a lot of this is intentions....
We'll have *-1 to wait and see" how the plan develops *T*-2.
The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor.
While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools, Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing.
Hewlett - Packard Co. also has begun *-1 to gain share in the whole computer - integrated - manufacturing arena.
IBM will face an uphill climb against Digital, given Digital's reputation for *PRO* being better than IBM at *PRO*-1 hooking together different manufacturers' computers.
In addition, Hewlett - Packard, while a much smaller player, has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that *T*-1 facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems.
Both can be expected *-1 to go after the market aggressively: Gartner Group Inc., a research firm, estimated 0 the Digital gets 30% of its revenue from the manufacturing market, and Hewlett - Packard gets 50%.
IBM, which Gartner Group said 0 *T*-1 generates 22% of its revenue in this market, should be able *PRO*-2 to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment.
That is because many companies will standardize on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge, and IBM is the biggest player.
But much will depend on how quickly IBM can move *T*-1.
The whole idea of computer - integrated manufacturing, CIM, seems *-2 to be making a comeback after *PRO*-2 losing a little luster over the past couple of years when it *EXP*-3 became apparent that it wasn't a panacea that *T*-1 would make U.S. plants more efficient and banish foreign competition *T*-4.
Erik Keller, a Gartner Group analyst, said 0 organizational changes may still be required *-1 *PRO* to really take advantage of CIM's capabilities--someone on the shop floor may not like *PRO*-2 having someone in an office using a personal computer *PRO*-3 to look over his shoulder, for instance, and may be able *PRO*-2 to prevent that from happening.
But he said 0 a system such as IBM's should help significantly.
In *PRO* making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips, for instance, a chip sometimes doesn't melt, gets caught *-1 in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets.
That can be expensive, because the problem may not be noticed *-1 for a while, and the sheets are typically thrown *-2 away.
But Mr. Keller said that, if computers can be integrated *-1 into the process, they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred.
They could also check through the orders on file *PRO*-3 to find a customer that *T*-1 was willing *PRO*-2 to accept a lower grade of polyethylene.
The computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled *-1, *PRO* eliminating waste.
This sort of improved link figures *PRO*-1 to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies.
Companies might be able *PRO*-2 to tell salespeople daily, for instance, about idle equipment, so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces *T*-1.
Salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered *-1 *T*-2--in much the same way that Federal Express has marketed its ability *PRO* to tell exactly where a package is *T*-3 in the delivery system *T*-4.
It *EXP*-1 is quite unfortunate that you failed so miserably in *PRO*-2 reporting the Hurricane Hugo disaster.
Your Sept. 27 page - one article "Charleston Lost Quite a Lot *ICH*-1 to Hugo, Especially Gentility" leaves the impression that the storm was little more than an inconvenience.
The damage reported * focused on a select few who *T*-1 owned irreplaceable historic homes on the Battery.
Not mentioned *-2 were *T*-1 the 50,000 people rendered * *PRO*-3 homeless, and the more than 200,000 out of work for an indeterminable period; the $1 billion - plus *U* in losses to homes and personal property on the barrier islands; the near - and long - term impact on the state's largest industry, tourism, not to mention the human suffering.
In *PRO*-1 centering on the disruption of a few proud local customs such as the historic homes tour and the damage to the antiquities, your reporter served *PRO*-1 to only perpetuate an outdated and stereotypically provincial view of this otherwise thriving port city.
The damage will undoubtedly prove *-1 to be one of the epic human and economic disasters of the decade in this country.

Your story was tasteless and insensitive.
*PRO* Depicting the people of a traumatized city reeling from a disaster of unprecedented proportions was at the very best ludicrous under the circumstances.
Your narrow focus appears *-1 to be a contrived attempt *PRO* to show the people of that historic city to be doddering fools.
You had *-3 to have been blind *PRO*-3 not to see the scenario there for what it was *T*-1 and is *T*-1 and will continue *-4 to be *T*-1 for months and even years--a part of South Carolina that *T*-2 has sustained a blow that the Red Cross expects 0 *T*-5 will cost that organization alone some $38 million *U*.

Wheeling - Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said 0 it decided *PRO*-1 to proceed with installation of automatic gauge and shape controls at its 60 - inch tandem cold rolling mill in Allenport, Pa.
The new equipment, which *T*-1 will produce steel sheet with more uniform thickness and flatness, is likely *-3 to cost more than $20 million *U*, the company said 0 *T*-2.
When the company last considered *PRO*-2 adding the equipment two years ago *T*-1, it estimated the cost at $21 million *U* to $22 million *U*, but a task force will have *-3 to prepare a detailed plan before the company can predict the current cost.

Included *-1 in the three - year contract are *T*-2 options for two one - year renewals.
NASA awarded the contract to CSC in November but an appeal by Sterling Software Inc. of Dallas sent the contract to the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals and the board required NASA *PRO*-1 to re-evaluate bidders' proposals.
Sterling had completed a five - year contract for NASA but lost its bid for renewal.
As *PRO*-2 directed *-1 by the board, NASA completed the evaluation and again chose CSC.

Couple Counseling Grows *PRO*-1 to Defuse Stress
MORE EXECUTIVES and their spouses are seeking counseling as work and family pressures mount.
Some employers initiate referrals, especially if work problems threaten a top manager's job.
Many couples "are like ships passing in the night," a communications gulf that *T*-1 sparks problems on the job and at home, says 0 *T*-2 psychologist Harry Levinson.
His Levinson Institute in Belmont, Mass., has seen in recent years a doubling in the number of executives and spouses at its weeklong counseling program.
Employers foot the bill, he says 0 *?*, *PRO*-3 figuring 0 what *T*-1's good for the couple is good for the company.
One East Coast manufacturing executive, *PRO*-2 faced *-3 with a job transfer 0 his wife resented *T*-1, found that counseling helped them both come to grips with the move.
And the vice president of a large Midwestern company realized that an abrasive temperament threatened his career when his wife confided that similar behavior at home harmed their marriage *T*-1.
More dual - career couples also are getting help, with men increasingly bringing their working wives for joint counseling.
"The level of stress for a woman is often so high, 0 it's the husband who *T*-1 says, ` I'm worried about her,"' says *T*-2 psychologist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz.
Her Institute for Family and Work Relationships in La Jolla, Calif., has noted a doubling in the number of couples seeking help the past two years.
"No matter how competent and smart you both are *T*-1, the relationship almost certainly will erode if you don't have time 0 *PRO* to talk, to have fun and to be sexual *T*-2," says *T*-3 Ms. Shaevitz.
She urges client couples *PRO*-1 to begin a "detoxification" period, *PRO*-2 purging social and other nonproductive activities and setting time apart for themselves.
"*PRO* Putting those times on the calendar," she says *?*, "is as important as *PRO* remembering business appointments."
Power of Suggestion Stronger in Japan
HERE'S *T*-3 ONE more explanation for why Japan is a tough industrial competitor *T*-1: Two of three Japanese employees submit suggestions 0 *T*-2 to save money, increase efficiency and boost morale, while only 8% of American workers do *?*.
And the Japanese make far more suggestions--2,472 per 100 eligible employees vs. only 13 per 100 employees in the
Data for 1987 from the National Association of Suggestion Systems and the Japan Human Relations Association also indicate that Japanese employers adopt four of five suggestions, while their U.S. counterparts accept just one in four.
In Japan, small suggestions are encouraged *-1.
Each new employee is expected *-1 to submit four daily in the first few months on the job.
U.S. companies tend *-2 to favor suggestions "that *T*-1 go for the home runs," says 0 *T*-3 Gary Floss, vice president of corporate quality at Control Data Corp.
That helps *PRO*-1 explain why American employers grant an average award of $604.72 *U* per suggestion, while Japan's payment is $3.23 *U* *T*-2.
Still, suggestions' net savings per 100 employees is $274,475 *U* in Japan vs. $24,891 *U* in the U.S. .
U.S. companies developing management teams are wrestling with how *PRO* to handle individual suggestion systems *T*-1.
Control Data, for one, plays down its employee suggestion program because it favors the team - management focus.
Merger Fallout: *PRO* Beware Employee Dishonesty
CORPORATE security directors increasingly worry that merger mania spawns a rise in employee dishonesty.
A Security magazine survey places the effect of takeovers and buy - outs among the industry's 10 biggest challenges.
"If it causes management to take their eye off the ball, inventory shrinkage is going *-2 to be affected *-1," says *T*-3 Lewis Shealy, vice president for loss prevention at Marshall Field's, the department store chain.
A separate study of the extent of employee misconduct linked general job satisfaction to property loss.
Co-author Richard Hollinger cites what *T*-1 happened at one family - owned company absorbed * by a foreign giant.
Pilferage climbed dramatically as many angry employees "felt abandoned by the former owners," says 0 *T*-1 the University of Florida sociologist.
But top management should watch for other tell - tale signs of employee misdeeds, like expense - account fudging and phone misuse.
Security consultant Dennis Dalton of Ventura, Calif., thinks 0 mergers often trigger longer lunch hours and increased absenteeism, conduct which *T*-1 can sap the bottom line more than thefts.
New management can take several steps *PRO* to reduce dishonesty.
Most important, experts say 0 *?*, is *T*-3 *PRO* to show that a company's ethical tone is set *-1 at the top.
Mr. Dalton also recommends that the chief executive establish a rumor control center and move swiftly *PRO*-1 to bolster morale.
Consultant John Keller of Southlake, Texas, urges that top management adopt a "tough hands - on approach" with very tight controls and monitoring.
And security authority Robert L. Duston favors *PRO* disciplining all employees who *T*-1 cheat.
Firms Walk Fine Line In *PRO*-1 Distributing Profits
ARE CORPORATE profits distributed *-1 fairly?
A survey by Sirota, Alper & Pfau, a New York consulting firm, underscores the difficulty for top management in *PRO* satisfying employees and investors on that score.
Nearly seven of 10 investors think 0 companies reinvest "too little" of their profits in the business.
And half the employees surveyed * think 0 companies dole out too little to them.
But both see a common enemy: About 66% of employees and 73% of investors think 0 senior managers get too big a slice of the profit pie.
Clinton Gas Systems Inc. said 0 it received a contract *ICH*-1 from Timken Co., Canton, Ohio, *PRO* to manage the natural gas purchasing, scheduling and transportation activities for Timken's seven Ohio *RNR*-2 and two Pennsylvania *RNR*-2 plants.
Clinton and Timken agreed *PRO*-1 not to disclose the value of the contract.
Timken, a producer of bearings and specialty steel, already buys gas from Clinton.
Clinton said in Columbus, Ohio, that its Clinton Gas Marketing unit wants *PRO*-1 to line up a number of such gas management contracts.
Manufacturers frequently don't have anyone who *T*-1 is a specialist in natural gas, Clinton said 0 *?*, and a specialist such as Clinton can save them substantial amounts of money.
Control Data Corp. said 0 it licensed its airline yield - management software to the International Air Transport Association.
Terms include a royalty arrangement, but details weren't disclosed *-1.
The computer equipment and financial services company said 0 IATA, a trade group, will sell access to the package to its 180 airline members world - wide.
Control Data will receive revenue linked * to the number of passengers served * by the software, IATA said 0 *T*-1.
The package helps carriers solve pricing problems, such as how *PRO* to react to discounts offered * by competitors *T*-2 or what *T*-1 would be the optimum number of seats 0 *PRO* to offer *T*-3 at a given price.
Helmsley Enterprises Inc. plans *PRO*-1 to close its company - owned insurance business and is seeking other brokers 0 *T*-2 to take over its policies, according to individuals familiar with the New York firm.
Helmsley Enterprises is the umbrella organization for companies controlled * by Harry B. Helmsley.
These include office and residential real estate giant, HelmsleySpear Inc., and Helmsley Hotels.
The insurance brokerage agency, just a fragment of Helmsley's vast empire, would be the first piece of the company 0 *T*-3 to be stripped *-1 away since last summer when Mr. Helmsley's wife, Leona Helmsley, was found *-2 guilty of tax evasion *T*-4.
Industry sources estimate 0 the agency brokers property and casualty premiums worth about $25 million *U* annually, and has revenue, based on a standard 10% commission rate, of about $2.5 million *U*.
The insurance firm acts as a broker on policies covering buildings managed * by HelmsleySpear and others.
Many of the properties are owned *-1 through limited partnerships controlled * by Mr. Helmsley.
New York State law prohibits insurance brokerages from *PRO*-1 deriving more than 10% of revenue from *PRO*-2 insuring affiliated companies.
Helmsley's insurance division had slightly exceeded that percentage, sources say 0 *?*, but the division wasn't considered *-2 significant enough to the company *PRO* to be restructured *-1, particularly at a difficult time for the firm.
Adverse publicity from the scandal surrounding its founder's wife and related management strife have put pressure on the entire Helmsley organization.
However, individuals close to the company insist 0 *PRO* shuttering the insurance division, a sideline from the company's core property management business, isn't the beginning of a sale of assets.
Helmsley's insurance premiums are expected *-2 to be transferred *-1 to several different insurance brokerage companies.
Frank B. Hall Inc. of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. is reportedly working out an agreement with Helmsley.
Officials there declined *PRO*-1 to comment, as did Helmsley management *?*.
In a move *PRO* to prevent any dislocation in the financial markets from the California earthquake, the Securities and Exchange Commission said 0 it temporarily reassigned options listed * on the Pacific Stock Exchange to the American, New York and Philadelphia stock exchanges and to the Chicago Board Options Exchange.
The decision, which *T*-3 affects millions of dollars of trading positions, was made *-1 late yesterday because the Pacific exchange's options floor was shut *-2 down as a result of Tuesday's earthquake.
The SEC, *PRO*-3 faced *-4 with a major squeeze on options positions, said 0 it *EXP*-2 was necessary *PRO* to ensure that options listed * on the exchange could be traded *-1 today and tomorrow.
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden said 0 the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors *PRO*-2 to buy and sell options listed * solely on the Pacific exchange, *PRO*-1 guaranteeing the liquidity of the market.
Officials at the four exchanges said 0 well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco *ICH*-1 late yesterday to the American, New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE, where they would continue *-3 making markets in the Pacific - listed options *T*-2.
The Big Board said 0 carpenters quickly erected a new options floor 0 *T*-1 to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange.
In addition, specialists on the exchanges agreed *PRO*-1 to provide backup capital for market - making in Pacific exchange options traded * on the exchanges.
Trading was light on the Pacific Stock Exchange yesterday, with workers at the exchange's main floor in San Francisco struggling *PRO*-1 to execute orders by flashlight as a result of a continuing power outage.
The most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading.
The Pacific exchange has options for 129 underlying stock issues, including highly active Hilton Hotels Corp., which *T*-2 is listed *-1 on the Big Board.
Investors were concerned that they might be unable *PRO*-2 to exercise options that *T*-1 expire tomorrow.
But professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown wouldn't be a cause for alarm even if it were *-1 to persist for several days.
"I've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability *PRO* to exercise their options, because they are guaranteed *-1 by the Options Clearing Corp.," said *T*-2 Michael Schwartz, a senior registered options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.
The SEC reassigned trading in the options, however, *PRO*-1 to allow investors to do more than *PRO* simply exercise the options.
While the exchange's equities floor in San Francisco remained open on a limited basis, orders were being routed and executed *-1 in Los Angeles.
Workers could dial out, but they couldn't receive telephone calls.
"It's a very uncertain situation right now," said *T*-2 Navin Vyas, administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange, which *T*-1 has daily volume of about 10 million shares.
Because the exchange's computer was rerouting orders to the exchange's trading operations in Los Angeles, "business is as usual" Mr. Vyas said 0 *T*-1.
"If one city is down, the other can take over."
Meanwhile, the brokerage firms in San Francisco were trying *PRO*-1 to cope.
Charles Daggs, chairman and chief executive officer of Sutro & Co., said 0 traders came to work at 5 a.m. PDT--many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions--but learned that they would have *-2 to await a required inspection by the city in order *PRO*-2 to turn the power back on at the company's two main facilities there.
That should happen by today, he said 0 *T*-1.
Traders worked with the help of sunlight streaming through windows, despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of incoming phone calls.
Also, most of the telecommunications equipment was out.
The traders were executing municipal bond *RNR*-2, mutual fund *RNR*-2 and other *RNR*-2 orders through a sister firm, Tucker Anthony Inc., which *T*-1 is also owned *-3 by John Hancock Freedom Securities but is based *-3 in New York.
"We are having a regular day.
Volume *ICH*-2 is down out of San Francisco, but not out of the 11 outlying offices," Mr. Daggs added *T*-1.
Sutro's Oakland office executed orders through the Sacramento office, which *T*-1 wasn't affected *-2 by the quake.
Others, like Prudential - Bache Securities Inc., which *T*-4 has eight offices in the San Francisco area, set up an 800 number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help.
At Kidder, Peabody & Co.'s Sacramento branch, Manager Janet White received calls yesterday morning from workers in San Francisco who *T*-1 offered *PRO*-2 to work in Sacramento.
Then she discovered that Quotron Systems Inc.'s Sacramento lines were down, because they are normally tied *-2 in through a system that *T*-1 goes through San Francisco.
So the Kidder brokers had *-1 to call other company offices *PRO*-2 to get quotes on stocks.
At Quotron, the company's National Call - In Center, which *T*-8 swung into action for the first time last month for Hurricane Hugo, assembled a tactical team *ICH*-4 at 5 a.m. yesterday 0 *T*-3 to begin *-2 rerouting lines and restore service to brokers and traders.
The company dispatched *T*-2 as many as 200 people in the San Francisco area 0 *T*-3 to do the work, though most of the rerouting was done *-1 by computer.
Service appeared *-2 to be down throughout the financial district in downtown San Francisco, while just parts of Oakland and San Jose were knocked *-1 out.
But Dale Irvine, director of the emergency center, said 0 service was being restored *-1 to outlying San Francisco areas.
In Chicago yesterday, Options Clearing confirmed that it guarantees the Pacific exchange options.
The firm also will permit its members and the public "*PRO*-2 to exercise their *PRO* put and call options contracts traded * on the Pacific exchange" even if the exchange is closed, said 0 *T*-1 Wayne Luthringshausen, chairman of Options Clearing.
(Put options give holders the right *RNR*-1, but not the obligation *RNR*-1, *PRO* to sell a financial instrument at a specified price, while call options give holders the right *RNR*-2, but not the obligation *RNR*-2, *PRO* to buy a financial instrument at a specified price).
Investors and traders in Pacific exchange options "are protected *-1 to the extent that they can convert their *PRO* put and call options into the underlying instrument," Mr. Luthringshausen said 0 *T*-2.
"We are seeing such exercises today, in fact.
On Wall Street yesterday, northern California's killer earthquake was just another chance *PRO* to make a buck.
At the opening bell, investors quickly began *-1 singling out shares of companies 0 *T*-2 expected *-3 to profit or suffer in some way from the California disaster, including insurers, construction - related companies, refiners and housing lenders.
Brokerage houses jumped in, *PRO*-2 touting "post-quake demand" stocks, and Kidder, Peabody & Co. set up a toll - free hot line for San Franciscans who *T*-1 might need emergency investment advice and help in *PRO*-3 transferring funds.
"Wall Street thinks of everything in terms of money," says *T*-1 Tom Gallagher, a senior Oppenheimer & Co. trader.
However, he added 0 *?*, such event - driven trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made *-2 without full information.
The most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as General Re Corp., which *T*-1 rose $2.75 *U* to $86.50 *U*, Nac Re Corp., up $2 *U* to $37.75 *U*, American International Group Inc., up $3.25 *U* to $102.625 *U*, and Cigna Corp., up 87.5 cents to $62.50 *U*.
Yesterday, the brokerage firm Conning & Co. said 0 insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse 0 *PRO* to raise insurance rates *T*-1, *PRO*-2 ending their long price wars.
Before this bullish theory surfaced, some insurance stocks initially fell, *PRO* indicating that investors thought 0 the quake might cost insurers a lot of money.
In fact, Fireman's Fund Corp., which *T*-1 ended the day off 50 cents to $36.50 *U*, said 0 earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth - quarter profit.
On the prospect for *PRO* rebuilding northern California, investors bid up cement - makers Calmat Co., up $2.75 *U* to $28.75 *U*, and Lone Star Industries Inc., up $1.75 *U* to $29.25 *U*.
Bridge and road builders *ICH*-2 had a field day, including Kasler Corp., up $2.125 *U* to $9.875 *U*, Guy F. Atkinson Co., up 87.5 to $61.875 *U*, and Morrison Knudsen Corp., which *T*-1 reported higher third - quarter earnings yesterday, up $2.25 *U* to $44.125 *U*.
Fluor Corp., a construction engineering firm, gained 75 cents to $33.375 *U*.
But home - building stocks were a mixed bag.
Timber stocks got a big boost.
Georgia Pacific Corp., up $1.25 *U* to $58 *U*, and Maxxam Inc., up $3 *U* to $43.75 *U*, both reported strong profits.
Merrill Lynch & Co. touted Georgia - Pacific, Louisiana Pacific Corp. and Willamette Industries Inc. as the best post-quake plywood plays.
Other gainers were companies with one or more undamaged California refineries.
Tosco Corp. jumped $1.125 *U* to $20.125 *U* and Chevron Corp., despite a temporary pipeline shutdown, rose $1 *U* to $65 *U*.
Meanwhile, shares of some big housing lenders got hit *-1, on the likelihood that the lenders' collateral--people's homes--suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value.
Wells Fargo & Co. fell 50 cents to $81.50 *U*, and BankAmerica Corp. fell 50 cents to $31.875 *U*.
Some California thrift stocks *ICH*-2 also fell, including Golden West Financial Corp. and H.F. Ahmanson & Co., which *T*-1 reported lower earnings yesterday.
"Property values didn't go up in California yesterday," says *T*-1 one money manager.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. fell 37.5 cents to $19.625 *U*.
One of its power generators was damaged *-1, though the company said 0 there won't be any financial impact.
Pacific Telesis Group lost 62.5 cents to $44.625 *U*.
A computer failure delayed its earnings announcement, and some investors think 0 it might have extra costs *PRO* to repair damaged telephone lines.
Heavy construction, property - casualty insurance and forest products were among the best performing industry groups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index yesterday.

Two years of coddling, down the drain.
That's the way 0 a lot of brokers feel *T*-2 today on the second anniversary of the 1987 stock - market crash.
Ever since that fearful Black Monday, they've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors--*PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to convince them that Oct. 19, 1987, was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place 0 for average Americans to put their hard - earned dollars *T*-3.
And until last Friday, it seemed 0 those efforts were starting *-1 to pay off.
"Some of those folks were coming back," says *T*-1 Leslie Quick Jr., chairman, of discount brokers Quick & Reilly Group Inc.
"We had heard from people who *T*-1 hadn't been active" for a long time.
Then came the frightening 190 - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a new wave of stock - market volatility.
All of a sudden, it was back to square one.
"It's going *-1 to set things back for a period, because it reinforces the concern of volatility," says *T*-2 Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
"I think 0 it will shake confidence one more time, and a lot of this business is based *-1 on client confidence."
Brokers around the country say 0 the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie.
Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way 0 they did in post-crash 1987 *T*-1.
"The kinds of questions 0 you had *T*-1 before have resurfaced," says *T*-2 Raymond A. "Chip" Mason, chairman of regional brokerage firm Legg Mason Inc., Baltimore.
"I can just tell 0 the questions are right back where they were *T*-2: ` What *T*-1's going on?,' ` Can't anything be done *-4 about program trading?,' ` Doesn't the exchange understand?,' ` Where is the SEC on this *T*-3?"'
Mr. Mason says 0 he's convinced 0 the public still wants *PRO*-2 to invest in common stocks, even though they believe 0 the deck is stacked *-1 against them.
But "these wide swings scare them to death."
All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that *T*-1 have big "retail," or individual - investor, businesses.
After *PRO*-2 expanding rapidly during the bull - market years up to the 1987 crash, retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business *PRO* to pay the overhead.
*PRO* True, the amount of money 0 investors are willing *PRO*-3 to entrust *T*-1 to their brokers has been growing lately.
But those dollars have been going into such "safe" products as money market funds, which *T*-1 don't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms.
At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co., such "cash - equivalent" investments recently accounted for a record $8 billion *U* of the firm's $25 billion *U* of client's assets.
The brokers' hope has been that they could soon coax investors into *PRO*-1 shifting some of their hoard into the stock market.
And before last Friday, they were actually making modest progress.
A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed *-1 to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988, according to Securities Industry Association data.
In 1987, an average 19.7% of Big Board volume was retail business, with the monthly level never more than 21.4%.
The retail participation dropped to an average 18.2% in 1988, and shriveled to barely 14% some months during the year.
Yet in 1989, retail participation has been more than 20% in every month, and was 23.5% in August, the latest month for which figures are available *T*-1.
Jeffrey Schaefer, the SIA's research director, says that all of his group's retail - volume statistics could be overstated *-1 by as much as five percentage points because corporate buy - backs are sometimes inadvertently included *-2 in Big Board data.
But there did seem *-1 to be a retail activity pickup.
But "Friday didn't help things," says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Schaefer.
With the gyrations of recent days, says 0 *?* Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab, many small investors are absolutely convinced that "they shouldn't play in the stock market."
Joseph Grano, president of retail sales and marketing at PaineWebber Group Inc., still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market.
Investors will develop "thicker skins," and their confidence will return, he says 0 *T*-1.
Friday's plunge, he is telling PaineWebber brokers 0 *?*, was nothing more than a "tremendous reaction to leveraged buy - out stocks."
Meanwhile, PaineWebber remains among the leaders in efforts *PRO* to simply persuade investors *PRO*-1 to keep *-2 giving Wall Street their money.
"It *EXP*-1's more of an important issue *PRO* to keep control of those assets, rather than push the investor *PRO*-3 to move into (specific) products such as equities," Mr. Grano says *T*-2.
"The equity decision will come when the client is ready *T*-1 and when there's a semblance of confidence *T*-2."
It could be a long wait, say 0 *T*-1 some industry observers.
"Some investors will tiptoe back in," says *T*-1 Richard Ross, a market research director for Elrick & Lavidge in Chicago.
"Then there'll be another swing.
Given enough of these, this will drive everyone *ICH*-1 out except the most hardy," he adds *T*-2.
Mr. Ross, who *T*-1 has been studying retail investors' perception of risks in the brokerage industry, said 0 a market plunge like Friday's "shatters investors' confidence in their ability *PRO* to make any judgments on the market."
The long - term outlook for the retail brokerage business is "miserable," Mr. Ross declares 0 *T*-1.
Mellon Bank Corp. said 0 directors authorized the buy - back of as many as 250,000 common shares.
The bank holding company said 0 stock repurchased * will be used *-1 *PRO* to meet requirements for the company's benefit plans.
Mellon has 36.6 million shares outstanding.
Friday's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here.
Petco Options, an options trading firm owned * by the family of the deceased former Chicago Board of Trade chairman Ralph Peters, is getting out of the trade clearing *RNR*-3, or processing and guaranteeing *RNR*-3, business after *PRO*-1 sustaining a multimillion dollar loss Friday, options industry officials said 0 *T*-2.
Nearly 75 options traders on the Chicago Board Options Exchange who *T*-1 cleared trades through Petco, including a handful of traders who *T*-2 lost between $500,000 to $1 million *U* themselves as a result of Friday's debacle, are trying *PRO*-3 to transfer their business to other clearing firms, CBOE members said 0 *T*-4.
Timothy Vincent, Petco chief executive officer, confirmed that Petco was withdrawing from the clearing business.
"The owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business, and after Monday they felt 0 they didn't want *PRO*-2 to be exposed *-1 any more," he said *T*-3.
He added that Petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market's rapid plunge Friday and Monday's rebound.
A CBOE spokeswoman declined comment on Petco.
Over the weekend Fossett Corp., another options trading firm, transferred the clearing accounts of about 160 traders to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., because it couldn't meet regulatory capital requirements after Friday's market slide.
The unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry's desire *PRO* not to have its credibility tarnished *-1 by potentially widespread trading defaults on Monday.
The CBOE, American Stock Exchange, Options Clearing Corp. and Stephen Fossett, owner of Fossett, joined in *PRO*-1 putting up $50 million *U* *PRO*-2 to guarantee the accounts at First Options.
The head of another small options clearing firm, who *T*-2 asked *PRO*-5 not to be identified *-1, said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it *EXP*-4 increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business.
Prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s, most trading firms clustered * around the LaSalle Street financial district here were family operations handed * down from one generation to the next.
Most also were relatively undercapitalized compared with the size of most Wall Street securities firms.
Mr. Peters, a LaSalle Street legend among the post-World War II generation of commodity traders, was rumored *-1 to have amassed a multimillion - dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time 0 he died in May *T*-2.
Insurers face the prospect of *PRO*-1 paying out billions of dollars for damages caused * by this week's California earthquake.
*PRO* Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced *T*-1 after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane, says 0 *T*-1 George Reider, a vice president in Aetna Life & Casualty Insurance Co.'s claims division.
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, *PRO*-2 coming so soon after the hurricane, will help *PRO*-2 stem more than two years of intense price - cutting wars among business insurers.
*PRO*-1 Reflecting that logic, insurance - company stocks posted strong gains.
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects 0 *T*-1 to help them assess structural damage.
Most insurers already have mobilized their "catastrophe" teams *PRO*-1 to begin *-2 processing claims from their policyholders in northern California.
Since commercial air travel is interrupted *-3, Aetna, based * in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes 0 *T*-2 to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to *PRO*-1 drive to the Bay area.
About 25 adjusters *ICH*-2 were dispatched *-1 yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks.
Some adjusters, already in other parts of California, drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that *T*-2 could be used *-1 as makeshift claims - processing centers.
Insurers will be advertising 800 numbers *ICH*-4--probably on the radio--that policyholders can call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to get assistance on how *PRO* to submit claims *T*-3.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes 0 the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million *U* in damages 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to pay *T*-2 out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
State Farm, based * in Bloomington, Ind., is also the largest writer of personal - property earthquake insurance in California.
Earthquake insurance is sold *-1 as a separate policy or a specific endorsement "rider" on a homeowner's policy in California, because of the area's vulnerability to earthquakes.
State Farm said 0 about 25% of its policyholders in California have also purchased earthquake insurance.
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., said 0 about 23% of its personal property policyholders--about 28% in the San Franciso area--also have earthquake coverage.
The Association of California Insurance Companies estimated 0 damage to residential property could total $500 million *U*, but only $100 million to $150 million *U* is insured *-1, it said 0 *T*-2.
Officials from the American Insurance Association's property - claim service division, which *T*-1 coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.
They expect *PRO*-1 to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two.
Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear *-1 to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that *T*-1 collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.
Industry officials say 0 the Bay Bridge--unlike some bridges--has no earthquake coverage, either, so the cost of *PRO* repairing it probably would have *-2 to be paid *-1 out of state general operating funds.
However, the bridge, which *T*-1 charges a $1 *U* toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance 0 *T*-2 to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.
That coverage is provided *-1 by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based * in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based * in Philadelphia.
Earthquake - related claims aren't expected *-1 to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole.
Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said 0 the total capital of the industry is likely *-1 to be higher *ICH*-2 at year end than it was *?* at midyear.
Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.
For example, insurers may seek *PRO*-2 to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by *PRO*-3 increasing the amount of reinsurance 0 they buy *T*-1.
Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses 0 the reinsurers will bear *T*-3 from these two disasters, are likely *-4 to spur increases in reinsurance prices that *T*-2 will later be translated *-1 into an overall price rise.
Reinsurance is protection taken * out by the insurance firms themselves.
"We are saying 0 this is the breaking point, this is the event that *T*-1 will change the psychology of the marketplace," said *T*-3 William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that *T*-2 specializes in the insurance industry.
His firm, along with some others, issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday.
Among the insurance stocks, big gainers included American International Group, up $3.25 *U* to $102.625 *U*; General Re Corp., up $2.75 *U* to $86.50 *U*; Aetna, up $2.375 *U* to $59.50 *U*; and Marsh & McLennan Inc., up $3.125 *U* to $75.875 *U*.
Still, a few individual companies, most likely smaller ones, could be devastated *-1.
"I think 0 there is a damned good chance 0 someone is going *-1 to hit the skids on this," said *T*-2 Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Myron Picoult.
He suspects 0 some insurers who *T*-2 had purchased reinsurance *PRO*-3 to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover 0 that reinsurance was used *-1 up by Hurricane Hugo.
British, West German, Scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the San Francisco earthquake disaster.
Although it *EXP*-1's unclear how much exposure the London market will face *T*-2, U.K. underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to U.S. catastrophe coverage.
Jack Byrne, chairman of Fireman's Fund, said 0 this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market, *PRO*-1 causing these rates to soar.
The catastrophe losses sustained * by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation - adjusted basis since 1906--when another earthquake sparked the Great San Francisco Fire *T*-1.
Orin Kramer, an insurance consultant in New York, estimates that the 1906 San Francisco destruction, on an inflation - adjusted basis, included insured losses of $5.8 billion *U*.
He is estimating 0 this week's disaster will generate insured losses of $2 billion *U* to $4 billion *U*, following about $4 billion *U* in costs to insurers from Hurricane Hugo.
Michael Maynard offered the world a faster way 0 *PRO* to break eggs *T*-1.
As thanks, the egg industry tried *PRO*-1 to break him.
And the egg producers have done a pretty good job.
They tried *PRO*-1 to put Mr. Maynard out of business by an act of Congress.
Egg - industry lobbying helped *PRO*-2 persuade six states *PRO*-1 to ban Mr. Maynard's automatic egg - breaking machine because of fears over salmonella.
His company, Misa Manufacturing Inc., was forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated *-1.
Monthly sales of his Egg King machine--which he now is marketing *T*-1 through a new company--have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75, says 0 *T*-2 the 46 - year - old businessman.
Mr. Maynard isn't the first entrepreneur 0 *T*-1 to bump up against entrenched interests.
But his case is notable both for the scale of the fight--it isn't often that a congressional hearing is held *-2 *PRO* to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic *T*-1--and for what it tells *T*-3 about the pitfalls of *PRO* marketing a new product.
Now one might ask why people who *T*-3 sell eggs would fight someone who *T*-4 is trying *PRO*-1 to make it *EXP*-2 easier *PRO* to crack them *T*-5.
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry.
Many larger egg producers are also egg processors, who *T*-1 crack, inspect, and sanitize billions of eggs, *PRO* turning them into powdered, liquified or frozen egg products.
However, dozens of bakers, restaurant chefs and other food preparers who *T*-1 flocked to Mr. Maynard's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to eclairs lose some zip when the eggs come in 30 - pound cans instead of shells *T*-2.
But for companies that *T*-1 use hundreds of eggs a day, *PRO* breaking them by hand can get, well, out of hand.
The idea behind the Egg King is pretty simple: *PRO* put the eggs into a cylinder that *T*-1 contains perforated baskets, spin them at a high speed *PRO*-2 to break the shells and strain the edible part through the baskets.
One Egg King--which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide *T*-2 has been likened *-1 to the robot R2 - D2--can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour.
Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones, a big egg user can recover the Egg King's $3,390 *U* cost in a few months, says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Maynard.
Such centrifugal egg breakers have been around since the 1890s.
But when Mr. Maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s *T*-1 nobody else was offering them in the U.S. .
The main reason: salmonella.
Chickens carry this bacteria, which *T*-1 can cause upset stomachs and, in rare cases, death among people.
Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs, and it can also be found *-1 on unclean shells.
Thus, any machine that *T*-1 breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential *PRO* to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones.
Mr. Maynard claims 0 this is a manageable problem.
The Egg King carries written instructions *PRO* to break only high - grade eggs that *T*-3 have been properly sanitized *-1 and, as an added precaution, to use the eggs only in products that *T*-4 will be cooked *-2 enough *PRO* to kill bacteria.
With nearly 4,000 machines in use, there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed *-1, Mr. Maynard boasts 0 *T*-2.
He says 0 the handful of salmonella cases involving products that *T*-1 may have used eggs broken * by an Egg King stemmed from a failure *PRO* to adequately cook the products.
But he says 0 that's no more a reason for *PRO* banning Egg Kings than bad drivers are a reason for *PRO* banning cars.
Opponents don't buy such arguments.
"Human nature being what it is *T*-1, people don't always follow instructions," says *T*-2 Jack Guzewich, chief of food protection for the New York state Health Department.
Leading the assault against the Egg King has been *T*-1 United Egg Producers.
The Decatur, Ga., trade group has issued a "briefing book" that *T*-1 claims 0 the machine is "a health hazard" and that Mr. Maynard is trying "*PRO*-2 to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation's egg producers."
The UEP declines *PRO*-2 to comment, but the group's attorney, Alfred Frawley, says 0 the group's actions are motivated *-1 solely by "health concerns."
An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used *-1 at egg - processing facilities regulated * by the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service.
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard, another branch of the USDA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, was in charge of eggs.
After *PRO*-2 receiving complaints from egg producers, this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval, *PRO*-2 thus limiting the machine's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that *T*-1 aren't regulated *-3 by the USDA.
The egg producers also lobbied the Food and Drug Administration.
But the FDA in a 1985 letter to the United Egg Producers said that there was "little likelihood" of a health problem as long as instructions were followed *-1.
So the producers went to Capitol Hill, where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure *PRO* to ban centrifugal egg - breaking machines *T*-1.
Mr. Maynard, whose company at the time *T*-3 was based *-1 in Santa Ana, Calif., enlisted his local congressman, and the battle was joined *-2.
Mr. Maynard's forces finally defeated the measure, though it *EXP*-3 took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives *PRO* to do it.
Even then, opponents managed *PRO*-2 to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called *T*-1 *PRO*-3 an "unscrupulous" method for *PRO* breaking eggs.
*PRO*-1 Foiled *-2 in their effort *PRO* to get a national ban, the egg producers turned their attention to the states.
So far, New York, New Jersey, Nebraska, Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard's device, *PRO*-1 citing health concerns.
An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard's company filed *T*-1 in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur's woes.
The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard's company *PRO*-1 to pay over $100,000 *U* in legal fees to the defendants' lawyers.
Mr. Maynard says 0 the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court.
Now he has moved to Oklahoma where costs are lower *T*-2, and started a new company, Adsi Inc., 0 *T*-3 to market his machine.
But, so far, the change of scenery hasn't ended his string of bad breaks.
Mr. Maynard recently fell from a horse and fractured his arm.
Money - market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week, as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market.
Money - fund assets soared $4.5 billion *U* in the week ended Tuesday, to a record $348.4 billion *U*, according to IBC / Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass. - based newsletter.
"We were expecting it, following the fall of the Dow Friday," said *T*-1 Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
"It's the proverbial flight to safety."
Despite recent declines in interest rates, money funds continue *-1 to offer better yields than other comparable investments.
The average seven - day compound yield on the 400 taxable funds tracked * by IBC / Donoghue's was 8.55% in the latest week, down from 8.60%.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year.
Most short - term certificates of deposit are yielding about 8% or less at major banks, and the yields on Treasury bills sold * at Monday's auction fell to 7.61% for three months and 7.82% for six months.
Money - fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $1.6 billion *U* a week in recent months, Ms. Negus said 0 *?*, *PRO*-1 reflecting the relatively high yields.
In the latest week, funds open to institutions alone grew by $1.8 billion *U*.
Some fund managers say 0 inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday's 190.58 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"If you're selling equities, you don't start *-3 getting proceeds for five to seven days," said *T*-2 Frank Rachwalski, who *T*-1 manages the Kemper Money Market Fund.
Neal Litvack, marketing vice president for Fidelity Investments, said 0 inflows Friday into Fidelity's Spartan and Cash Reserves money - market funds were about twice normal levels, with about half coming from equity and junk - bond funds.
Monday and Tuesday "were lackluster in comparison," he said 0 *T*-1.
"People aren't necessarily running *PRO*-2 scared," Mr. Litvack said *T*-1.
"They're maintaining their attitude toward investing, which *T*-1 has leaned toward the conservative recently."
Money - fund yields tend *-1 to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments--short - term Treasury securities, commercial paper and the like--*PRO*-2 to capture the highest yields.
Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising *T*-1 and longer when they are falling *T*-2.
The average maturity of the funds tracked * by IBC / Donoghue's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week.
It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when rates were marching steadily upward *T*-1, and hit 42 days in August.
The average seven - day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21% this week from 8.26%.
The average 30 - day simple yield was 8.26%, compared with 8.27% the week before, and the 30 - day compound yield slid to 8.60% from 8.61%.
Some funds are posting yields far higher than the average.
The highest yielding taxable fund this week was Harbor Money Market Fund, with a seven - day compound yield of 12.75%.
That included capital gains that *T*-2 were passed *-1 along to customers.
Among the other high - yielding funds, Fidelity's Spartan Fund had a seven - day compound yield of 9.33% in the latest week.
The seven - day compound yield of the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund was 9.51%.
Two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten *PRO*-1 to hinder leveraged buy - outs by *PRO*-2 raising the price tags of such deals by as much as 10%.
Wall Street is seething over the rules, which *T*-1 would curtail the tax deductibility of debt used * in most LBOs.
The provisions, in deficit - reduction bills recently passed * by the House and Senate, could further cool the takeover boom that *T*-1 has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s, some tax experts and investment bankers argue 0 *T*-2.
Indeed, some investment bankers have already started *-1 restructuring deals *PRO*-2 to cope with the expected rules.
Wall Street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous Senate version of one of the provisions.
At issue is *T*-3 the deductibility of certain junk bonds that *T*-2 are used *-1 in most LBOs.
Such high - yield debt is similar to a zero - coupon bond in that it is sold *-1 at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid *-3 to the holder.
Under current rules, that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt.
The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction, and label any such debt as equity, which *T*-1 isn't deductible.
The less - rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years.
"You see these in just about every LBO," said *T*-1 Robert Willens, senior vice president in charge of tax issues at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
"It becomes a source of cash" for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and doesn't have *-1 to repay the debt for several years.
Typically, Mr. Willens estimates 0 *?*, this type of debt makes up 15% to 20% of the financing for LBOs.
These types of bonds have been used *-1 in buy - outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc., Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co.
A second provision passed * by the Senate and House would eliminate a rule allowing companies that *T*-1 post losses resulting from LBO debt to receive refunds of taxes paid * over the previous three years.
For example, if a company posted a loss of $100 million *U* from buy - out interest payments, the existing rule would allow the concern to be able *PRO*-2 to receive a refund from the tax 0 it paid *T*-1 from 1986 through 1989, when it may have been a profitable public company *T*-3.
But that rule is being virtually overlooked *-1 by Wall Street, which *T*-2 is concentrating on *PRO*-3 coping with the deduction issue.
"Prices for LBOs have *-1 to come down if you don't have that feature," argued *T*-2 Lawrence Schloss, managing director for merchant banking at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
Several Wall Street officials say 0 the proposed legislation already is having an impact.
An investment group led * by Chicago's Pritzker family recently lowered a $3.35 billion *U* bid for American Medical International, Beverly Hills, Calif., because of the threat of the legislation.
Moreover, one investment banker, who *T*-1 requested anonymity, said 0 his firm didn't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that *T*-2 wasn't concerned about the financing provision.
"We would have paid more if we thought 0 that law wasn't going *-2 to pass," he said *T*-1.
One possible solution for Wall Street is *PRO* to increase the equity part of the transaction--that is, give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments.
That would force the buy - out firm and the target company's management to *PRO*-1 reduce their level of ownership.
"The pigs in the trough may have *-1 to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through," said *T*-2 Peter C. Canellos, tax partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
Another solution, said 0 *?* a tax lawyer who *T*-1 requested anonymity, is for firms to use convertible bonds that *T*-2 sell at a discount.
Since they have a lower interest rate, they wouldn't fall under the junk - bond category that *T*-1 would lose its deductibility.
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five - year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five.
The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore isn't deductible.
The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid *-1.
Currently, even though the issuer doesn't pay tax, the debt holder is taxed *-1 on the accrued interest.
But those holders are often foreign investors and tax - exempt pension funds that *T*-1 don't pay taxes on their holdings.
The Senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $17 million *U* the first year and a total of $409 million *U* over five years.
The House version would raise slightly more.
Even if Wall Street finds ways around the new rules, a Senate aide contends 0 LBOs will become somewhat more difficult.
"There's no question 0 it will make LBOs more expensive," he said *T*-1.
"The interest deduction was the engine that *T*-1 made these things more productive.
Bond prices rambled yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply.
Early yesterday, bonds rose as investors rushed *PRO*-1 to buy Treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive California earthquake.
For example, some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies, which *T*-1 face massive damage claims, would get hit *-2 hard.
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead *T*-1, bonds drifted lower.
With stocks not a major focus, "we're waiting for the next guiding light," said 0 *T*-1 Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc.
"If the stock market tremors are behind us, then the bond market will go back to *PRO*-3 looking at the next batch of economic numbers *PRO*-2 to determine" where interest rates are heading *T*-1.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond, which *T*-1 jumped 3/8 point, or about $3.75 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, during the first hour of trading, ended *PRO*-2 little changed.
Interest rates barely budged from Tuesday's levels.
Most junk bonds, which *T*-2 have been battered *-1 in recent weeks, continued a slow recuperation and ended *PRO*-3 unchanged to slightly higher.
But some so - called high - quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues *PRO*-1 to raise cash.
RJR Holdings Capital Corp.'s 14.7% bonds due 2009 fell one point.
Other RJR issues fell between 1/2 point and 1 1/2 point.
In the latest sign of how difficult it *EXP*-1 is *T*-2 *PRO* to place certain junk bonds, Continental Airlines said 0 it was forced *-3 *PRO*-4 to scale back the size of its latest offering.
Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., slashed the size of its note offering from $150 million *U* to $71 million *U*.
The move had been widely expected.
In the multipart offering, the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes.
A Continental spokeswoman said 0 the notes may be offered *-1 at a later date.
"This was not a *PRO* do - or - die deal," she said *T*-1.
"I think 0 this is a market that *T*-1 required some level of security.
It *EXP*-1 did not make sense *PRO* to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market."
Investors have been speculating for weeks about the market's ability *PRO* to place the $7 billion to $10 billion *U* of new junk bonds scheduled * *PRO*-2 to be sold *-1 by year end.
Supply troubles were also on the minds of Treasury investors *ICH*-2 yesterday, who *T*-1 worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week.
"We're being bombarded *-1 by new Treasury and agency debt offerings," said *T*-2 William Sullivan Jr., director of money - market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
"The market is concerned about its ability *PRO* to underwrite all this debt at current levels."
In addition to the $15.6 billion *U* of Treasury bills 0 *T*-2 to be sold *-3 at next week's regular Monday auction, the government will sell $10 billion *U* of new two - year Treasury notes.
And Resolution Funding Corp. said late yesterday that it will sell $4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds Wednesday.
Refcorp is the financing unit of Resolution Trust Corp., a new government agency created * *PRO*-1 to rescue the nation's troubled thrifts.
Its securities have been dubbed *-1 "*PRO*-2 bailout bonds" by traders.
In when - issued trading, the two - year Treasurys had a yield of about 7.88%.
In the municipal market, all eyes were on California debt as investors tried *PRO*-1 to gauge the financial ramifications of Tuesday's earthquake.
But traders said 0 the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of California state and local municipal debt.
"There are certain bonds 0 traders refer to *T*-1 as ` earthquake' bonds because the (issuers) are on top of the San Andreas fault," said Zane Mann, editor of the California Municipal Bond Advisor, a newsletter for investors.
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield, an extra premium for the earthquake risk, they weren't materially affected *-1.
But some bond market analysts said 0 that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble *PRO*-1 to sell portions of their municipal portfolios *PRO* to raise cash 0 *PRO* to pay damage claims *T*-2.
"Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill *PRO* to reconstruct San Francisco," said *T*-1 Charles Lieberman, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as California is forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to issue new debt over time *PRO*-1 to repair public facilities.
A report issued * late yesterday by Standard & Poor's Corp. concluded 0 the quake won't cause "wide - scale credit deterioration" for issuers and debt issues in the 12 - county area of Northern California affected * by the quake.
Treasury Securities
Treasury bonds ended *PRO*-1 narrowly mixed in quiet trading.
The benchmark 30 - year bond ended at a price of 100 29/32 0 *PRO* to yield 8.03% *T*-1, compared with 100 28/32 0 *PRO* to yield 8.04% *T*-3 Tuesday.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 late at a price of 99 26/32 0 *PRO* to yield 8% *T*-2, compared with 99 25/32 0 *PRO* to yield 8.01% *T*-3.
Short - term rates were little changed *-1.
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporate bonds ended *PRO*-1 1/4 point lower.
The Continental junk bond offering, underwritten * by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was the only new issue priced * yesterday.
In the four - part offering, the $71 million *U* of secured equipment certificates was priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield 13.75% to 15.75%.
Municipals
Municipal bonds ended *PRO*-1 about 1/8 to 3/8 point lower, *PRO*-1 hurt *-2 by the circulation of two "bid - wanted" lists totaling $655 million *U*.
Chemical Securities Inc. is acting as agent for the seller.
Meanwhile, some California issues were down a touch more than the broad market, but traders said 0 there hadn't been much investor selling because of the quake.
But New York City general obligation bonds came under selling pressure.
Traders said 0 a steady stream of bonds was put *-1 up for sale yesterday, *PRO* pushing yields for longer maturities up 0.05 percentage point.
Traders said 0 investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city's finances and are nervous ahead of the Nov. 7 election.
Washington, D.C., topped the competitive slate yesterday with a sale of $200 million *U* of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes.
In late trading, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was off 1/4 point at 98 bid *.
The yield was 7.35%, up 0.01 percentage point.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities ended *PRO*-1 little changed after light dealings.
There was no appreciable market impact from the California earthquake.
Dealers said 0 there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced *-1 *PRO*-5 to sell mortgage securities *PRO*-3 to help *PRO* pay earthquake - related claims, but no selling materialized.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage Association, two dominant issuers of mortgage securities, have a sizable amount of California home loans in their mortgagebacked pools.
But their potential quake exposure is seen *-1 as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans 0 they purchase *T*-2.
And because Northern California home prices are so high, loans from the region often are too large 0 *T*-2 to be included *-3 in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae pools.
Meanwhile, Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for November delivery ended at 97 29/32, *PRO*-1 unchanged.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 4/32, down 1/32.
In derivative markets, Fannie Mae issued two $400 million *U* real estate mortgage investment conduits backed * by its 9% securities.
Foreign Bonds
British government bonds, or gilts, ended *PRO*-1 moderately lower as equities there recovered from Tuesday's drop.
The Treasury's 11 3/4% bond due 2003 / 2007 fell 11/32 to 111 31/32 *PRO*-1 to yield 10.08%, while the 12% notes due 1995 were down 7/32 to 103 22/32 *PRO*-2 to yield 11.04%.
Traders said 0 today may be an anxious day for the market.
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to give the annual "Mansion House" address to the financial community.
The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion *PRO*-1 to announce major economic policy changes.
Economists don't expect any such changes in this year's address, given Mr. Lawson's apparent reluctance *PRO* to adjust policy currently.
Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds retreated in quiet trading, *PRO*-1 stymied *-2 by the dollar's resiliency.
Japan's bellwether 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at 95.75 0 *PRO* to yield 5.315% *T*-1.
In West Germany, investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction.
The government's 7% issue due October 1999 fell 0.05 point to 99.90 *PRO*-1 to yield 7.01%.
Granges Inc., *PRO*-1 citing depressed gold prices, said 0 it plans *PRO*-2 to suspend operations for an indefinite period at its Tartan gold mine in Manitoba.
Granges said in Vancouver, British Columbia, that the production halt will be phased *-1 in over a 10 - week period.
Tartan currently produces gold at a cash operating cost of $393 *U* an ounce, which *T*-1 is high by industry standards and $25 *U* or so above the current spot price.
Granges said 0 it also plans *PRO*-1 in the third quarter to write down the carrying value of the Tartan mine by 2.5 million Canadian dollars (US$2.12 million *U*), and to write off most of the C$6.3 million *U* carrying value of its Windflower gold property in British Columbia.
Granges didn't say what impact the moves would have *T*-1 on total gold output or earnings, and company officials weren't available.
Randy Delchamps was named *-2 *PRO*-3 chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain.
Mr. Delchamps, 46 years old, succeeds A.F. Delchamps Jr., who *T*-1 died in a plane crash on Sunday at the age of 58.
Randy Delchamps retains his position as president.
Silicon Valley heaved a sigh of relief yesterday.
Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that *T*-1 shook the high - tech corridor along with the rest of the San Francisco Bay area, a spot check of computer makers turned up little, if any, potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment.
Analysts and corporate officials said 0 they expected practically no long - term disruption in shipments from the Valley of either hardware or software goods.
Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. were all up and running yesterday, though many workers were forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to stay home because of damaged roadways; others elected *PRO*-2 to take the day off.
"These systems are more rugged than many people would believe *?*," said *T*-2 Thomas Kurlak, who *T*-1 tracks the computer industry for Merrill Lynch Research.
"It's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit."
Other companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett - Packard Co., completely idled their operations because of Tuesday evening's temblor, which *T*-1 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
Personnel spent the morning *PRO*-1 inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses, mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors.
Still, many were confident that "in a day or two, everything should be back to normal," according to a spokeswoman for the Semiconductor Industry Association, based * in Cupertino.
IBM, for instance, said 0 it anticipates *PRO*-2 returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its San Jose plant, which *T*-1 puts out disk drives for the 3090 family of mainframes.
A Hewlett - Packard spokeswoman said that, while "things are a big mess," some 18,000 Valley employees have been called *-1 back to work today.
Apple Computer added that it was being "cautiously optimistic," despite *PRO*-1 not yet closely eyeballing all of its 50 buildings in the region.
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant Fremont plant, to the north of the Valley, was believed *-1 to be undamaged.
Sun Microsystems Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly.
Digital Equipment Corp., with major facilities in Santa Clara, Cupertino, Palo Alto and Mountain View, said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in Maynard, Mass., Tuesday night.
None sustained "significant" damage, a spokesman said 0 *T*-1, *PRO*-3 adding that "the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked *-2 and were all found *-2 to be operating normally."
For many companies, of course, there is still a slew of nagging problems 0 *PRO* to grapple with *T*-3, some of which *T*-2 have the potential *PRO* to become quite serious.
For example, a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said 0 the Sunnyvale chip maker is worried about blackouts.
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built *-1.
But, given what *T*-1 might have happened to the fragile parts that *T*-2 are at the heart of the microelectronics business, the bulk of Valley companies seemed *-3 to be just about shouting hosannas.
Several factors apparently spared the Valley--a sprawling suburban stretch from San Jose to Palo Alto--from the kind of impact felt * in San Francisco, an hour's drive north.
For one thing, buildings there tend *-1 to be newer and, thus, in step with the latest safety codes.
Also, the soil in the Valley is solid, unlike the landfill of San Francisco's downtown Marina District, which *T*-2 was hit *-1 with fires and vast destruction.
In addition, some microelectronics companies said 0 they were prepared for tremulous conditions like Tuesday's.
Their machine tools are even bolted *-1 to the shop floor.
Intel said that over the past decade, it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves, sensitive to the shake of an earthquake, in the pipes that *T*-1 snake through its plants.
Like other large Valley companies, Intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation, so that a breakdown at one location shouldn't leave customers *PRO*-1 in a total pinch.
That's certainly good news for such companies as Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, which *T*-1 has only a four - day supply of microprocessors from the Valley on hand because of a just - in - time manufacturing approach that *T*-2 limits the buildup of inventory.
Compaq said 0 it foresees no difficulties in *PRO*-1 obtaining parts in the immediate future.
Computer makers were scrambling *PRO*-1 to help customers recover from the disaster.
Digital Equipment has set up disaster - recovery response centers in Dallas, Atlanta and Colorado Springs, Colo.
These units were handling calls both from people in the San Francisco area and from computers themselves, which *T*-1 are set *PRO*-2 to dial Digital automatically when trouble arises *T*-3.
They then run remotely controlled self - diagnostic programs.
Digital also said 0 it has dispatched teams of technicians to California.
Meanwhile, several other major installations around the Valley--America's center of high - tech--said 0 they, too, fared as well as *PRO* could be expected *-1.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the Energy Department tests *RNR*-2 and conducts research on *RNR*-2 nuclear weapons *T*-1, had only "superficial damage," a spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
At Lockheed Corp.'s missiles and space systems group in Sunnyvale, about 40 miles south of San Francisco, workers were asked *-2 *-4 *PRO*-5 to head to work yesterday after it *EXP*-3 was realized *-1 that "there were no show - stoppers" in the 150 - plus buildings on its one - square - mile campus.
Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny *PRO*-3 to make sure 0 they weren't in danger of crumbling, but "the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape," an official said 0 *T*-2.
One of Lockheed's most lucrative sectors--accounting for more than half the aerospace company's $10.59 billion *U* in sales in 1988--the missiles and space group is the prime Pentagon contractor on the Trident II ballistic missile.
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called *PRO* *PRO*-1 the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Fortunately, the Hubble Space Telescope--set *PRO* to be launched *-2 on the shuttle next year in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted * 14 billion years ago from the farthest reaches of the universe--was moved *-1 from Sunnyvale to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the beginning of October.

whose Della Femina McNamee WCRS agency *T*-1 created liar Joe Isuzu, among others--announced a massive restructuring that *T*-2 largely removes it from the advertising business and includes *PRO*-3 selling the majority of its advertising unit to Paris - based Eurocom.
The complex restructuring, which *T*-1 was long expected *-2, transforms London - based WCRS from primarily a creator of advertising into one of Europe's largest buyers of advertising time and space.
It also creates a newly merged world - wide ad agency controlled * by Eurocom and headed * jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives.
The merged agency's admittedly ambitious goal: *PRO* to become one of the world's 10 largest agencies, while *PRO*-2 attracting more multinational clients than 0 the agencies were able *PRO*-3 to attract *T*-1 alone.
WCRS's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in Europe, where the only way 0 *PRO* to get a good price on advertising time and space *T*-1 is *PRO* to buy it in bulk *T*-2.
For Eurocom, meanwhile, the move gives it a strong U.S. foothold in Della Femina, and more than quadruples the size of its ad agency business world - wide.
It also gives the outspoken Mr. Della Femina--who *T*-1 often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients--an international platform that he most certainly won't be loath *PRO*-3 to use *T*-2.
According to terms, WCRS will pay 2.02 billion French francs ($318.6 million *U*) for the 50% 0 it doesn't already own *T*-3 of Carat Holding S.A., one of Europe's largest media buyers.
Meanwhile, Eurocom, which *T*-1 had held 20% of WCRS's ad unit, will pay #43.5 million *U* ($68.5 million *U*) *PRO*-2 to raise its stake to 60%.
That price also covers Eurocom raising to 60% its 51% stake in Europe's Belier Group, a joint venture ad agency network 0 it owns *T*-1 with WCRS.
Eurocom will also have the right *PRO* to buy the remaining 40% of the merged ad agency group in six years.
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd., or EWDB.
The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based * in New York, Eurocom's various agencies in France, the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS's other advertising and direct marketing operations.
Mr. Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight.
Both will report to Tim Breene, a former WCRS executive who *T*-1 will be chief executive officer at the new agency.
In an interview in New York, Mr. Breene, fresh from a Concorde flight from Paris where executives had worked through most of the night *T*-1, outlined big plans for the new agency.
"Our goal is *PRO* to develop quite rapidly to a top - 10 position...by the end of three years from now.
It implies very dramatic growth," he said *T*-1.
He added that Eurocom and WCRS had agreed *PRO*-1 to provide a development fund of #100 million *U* for acquisitions.
The new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in Spain, while Mr. Breene said 0 it also plans *PRO*-1 to make acquisitions in Scandinavia, Germany and elsewhere.
*PRO* Cracking the top 10 within three years will be difficult at best.
Della Femina had billings of just $660 million *U* last year and ranked as the U.S.'s 24th - largest ad agency.
The merged company that it now becomes part of *T*-1 will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion *U*--most of that in Europe--*PRO* bringing it to about 14th world - wide.
*PRO*-1 To make it to top - 10 status, it would have *-1 to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom's DDB Needham.
The merged agency's game plan *PRO* to attract multinational packaged - goods advertisers may prove *-1 equally difficult.
When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988 *T*-1, it said 0 it did so in order *PRO*-2 to attract larger clients, especially packaged - goods companies.
Since then, Della Femina won Pan Am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged - goods clients, including Dow Chemical Co.'s Saran Wrap.
But major packaged - goods players of the world--such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate - Palmolive and Unilever--have steadfastly eluded the agency.
"Three of our favorite names," Mr. Della Femina calls that roster *PRO*-4 *-1, *PRO*-2 adding hopefully, "We're a much more attractive agency *ICH*-3 to large multinationals today than we were *?* yesterday."
Still, the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media - buying firms that Europe has seen *T*-1.
As part of the restructuring, WCRS and Eurocom said 0 they will look for ways 0 *PRO* to combine their media buying across Europe *T*-1.
What *T*-1's more, both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross, who *T*-2 founded Carat, will acquire 14.99% stakes in WCRS Group, *PRO* creating a powerful link between Eurocom and Carat.
Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that WCRS is buying *T*-1, while Eurocom said 0 it expects *PRO*-2 to pay about #32 million *U* for its WCRS stake.
Mr. Della Femina says 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world - wide agency, *PRO*-2 serving as a sort of "creative conscience."
Louise McNamee, Della Femina's president, will continue *-1 running the U.S. agency day - to - day.
They and other top executives signed long - term employment contracts and Mr. Della Femina will receive an additional multimillion - dollar sum, which some industry executives pegged *T*-1 at about $10 million *U*.
WCRS Group, for its part, will now be able *PRO*-2 to follow its longstanding plan of *PRO*-3 becoming "a holding company for a series of media - related businesses," said 0 *T*-1 Peter Scott, the firm's chief executive.
In addition to Carat, WCRS will hold onto its public relations, TV programming and other businesses.
WCRS says 0 its debt will be cut *-1 to #24 million *U* from #66 million *U* as a result of the transaction.
For Carat, meanwhile, the alliance with Eurocom and WCRS is intended *-1 to strengthen its own push outside France.
Carat's Gross brothers invented the idea of large - scale buying of media space.
By *PRO*-1 buying the space in bulk, they obtain discounts as high as 50%, which they can pass on *T*-2 to customers.
They thus have won the French space - buying business of such advertising giants as Coca - Cola Co., Fiat S.p . A., Gillette and Kodak.
But now, other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing media - buying groups--and Carat wants *PRO*-1 to expand to the rest of Europe.
*PRO*-1 To help *PRO*-2 finance the Carat purchase, WCRS said 0 it plans an issue of Euroconvertible preferred shares once the market settles down.
But WCRS added that "in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets," it has arranged medium - term debt financing, which *T*-2 would be underwritten *-1 by Samuel Montagu & Co. Ltd.
Earthquake's Damage
Tuesday's earthquake brought the San Francisco ad scene to a screeching halt yesterday, with only a few staffers showing up at their offices, *PRO*-1 mainly to survey the damage or to wring their hands about imminent new - business presentations.
While no agencies reported injuries to employees, the quake damaged the offices of J. Walter Thompson, Chiat / Day / Mojo and DDB Needham, among others, spokesmen for those agencies said 0 *T*-1.
Staffers at Thompson, whose offices *T*-1 are in the ultramodern Embarcadero Center, watched pictures drop from the walls and then felt the skyscraper sway seven to eight feet, according to a spokeswoman.
Plaster fell and windows were broken *-2 at Chiat / Day / Mojo, a spokesman for that agency said 0 *T*-3.
Late yesterday afternoon, DDB Needham executives were scrambling *PRO*-5 to figure out what *PRO* to do *T*-3 about a new business presentation that *T*-2 had been scheduled *-1 for today, a spokesman said 0 *T*-4.
DDB Needham's office building may have sustained structural damage, the spokesman added 0 *T*-1.
"All operations have stopped," he said *T*-1.
A number of agencies, including Thompson and Foote, Cone & Belding, said 0 some employees who *T*-1 live outside of San Francisco, *PRO*-2 fearful that they wouldn't be able *PRO*-3 to get home, spent the night at the agency.

The dividend is payable Dec. 15 to stock of record Nov. 15.
FARMERS REAP abundant crops.
But how much will shoppers benefit *T*-1?
The harvest arrives in plenty after last year's drought - ravaged effort: The government estimates corn output at 7.45 billion bushels, up 51% from last fall.
Soybean production swells 24%.
As a result, prices paid * to farmers for the commodities, which *T*-2 are used *-1 in products as diverse as bubble gum and chicken feed, plummet 20% to 33%.
But *PRO* don't expect too much in the way of price breaks soon at the supermarket.
Economists expect consumer food prices to jump 5.5% this year to the highest level since 1980 and up from last year's 4.1% rise.
Next year may see a drop of one percentage point.
Beef prices, *PRO*-1 hovering near records since the drought, could drop in earnest this winter if ranchers expand herds.
Lower feed prices may help animals *PRO*-2 eat more cheaply, but humans have *-1 to factor in an expensive middleman: the processor.
Food companies probably won't cut their prices much, *PRO*-1 blaming other costs.
"Labor takes the biggest single chunk out of the ` food dollar,"' says *T*-1 Frank Pankyo of the Food Institute.
Stokely says 0 stores revive specials like three cans of peas for 99 cents.
Two cans cost 89 cents during the drought.
IF IN VITRO fertilization works, it usually does so after only a few tries.
Costly infertility problems and procedures proliferate as aging baby boomers and others decide *PRO*-1 to have children--now.
It's estimated that one in six couples experiences infertility, and in 1987, Americans spent about $1 billion *U* *PRO*-1 to fight the problem.
Only about five states now offer some form of insurance coverage, but more are expected *-1.
A letter in the New England Journal of Medicine notes that while technology offers "almost endless hope...when *PRO* to stop *T*-1 has become a difficult question...."
The authors, from Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, say that 84% of the 50 births 0 they followed *T*-1 occurred after only two in vitro cycles.
It adds that births were "extremely unlikely" after the fourth cycle and concludes 0 couples who *T*-2 don't achieve a pregnancy after four to six procedures should be advised *-1 that success is unlikely.
Some couples continue *-1 to try.
"Such determination may translate into extreme physical, emotional and financial costs," the letter warns *T*-1.
MARKET MOVES, these managers don't *?*.
Only three of the 25 corporate pension fund managers attending a Lowry Consulting Group client conference say 0 they plan *PRO*-1 to change the asset allocation mix in their portfolios because of the market drop.
WORLD ODDITIES come alive in a multimedia version of the Guinness Book of Records.
The $99 *U* CD - ROM disk (it can only be played *-1 on an Apple Macintosh computer at the moment) combines animation, music and sound.
Among the Guinness disk's wonders: the world's loudest recorded belch.
ARTY FAX from David Hockney begins a tongue - in - cheek exhibit today at New York's Andre Emmerich Gallery.

PACS GIVE and receive in a debatable duet with employees' favored charities.
The Federal Election Commission clears corporate plans *PRO* to donate to an employee's chosen charity in exchange for the worker's gift to the company political action committee.
Latest approvals: Bell Atlantic's New Jersey Bell and General Dynamics.
Companies get more political clout plus a possible tax - deductible charitable donation--so far no word from the IRS on deductibility.
Detroit Edison, the plan pioneer, generated $54,000 *U* in matching funds *ICH*-1 this year, up from $39,000 *U* in 1988.
But the utility may not continue next year.
"We're on a tight budget," says *T*-2 Detroit Edison's Carol Roskind.
Two election commission members opposed the matching plans.
Scott E. Thomas says 0 the plans give employees "a bonus in the form of charitable donations made * from an employer's treasury" in exchange for the political donation.
"The U.S. government could be, in effect, subsidizing political contributions to corporate PACs," he says *T*-1.
New Jersey Bell awaits state clearance.
Despite federal approval, General Dynamics says 0 it decided 0 it won't go ahead with the matching program.
CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS find a helping hand from some catalog companies.
Blunt Ellis & Loewi estimates 0 direct mail catalog sales rose to $12 billion *U* last year.
And while it's too soon 0 *PRO* to tell how sales will fare *T*-2 in the important 1989 Christmas season *T*-1, some companies take steps 0 *PRO* to ease the usual 11th - hour crush *T*-3.
Spiegel promises a "Guaranteed Christmas," with a pledge *PRO* to deliver goods before Christmas if *PRO* ordered *-1 by Dec. 20.
And, for an extra $6 *U*, Land's End will deliver orders within two days; customers can designate the day.
Spiegel, which *T*-1 also owns Eddie Bauer and Honeybee, says that since 1987, sales have doubled during the week before Christmas.
An L.L. Bean spokeswoman notes: "People are just used to *PRO*-1 living in a last - minute society."
Blunt Ellis, a Milwaukee brokerage firm, says 0 part of the reason 0 catalog sales grow in popularity *T*-3 is because consumers have more money but less time 0 *PRO* to spend it *T*-1.
L.L. Bean hires about 2,700 workers *ICH*-1 for the season rush, about 300 more than last year; Land's End hires 2,000.
BRIEFS:
Guarana Antarctica, a Brazilian soft drink, is brought *-1 to the U.S. by Amcap, Chevy Chase, Md.
New Product News says 0 the beverage "looks like ginger ale, tastes a little like cherries and smells like bubble gum ."...
"Amenities" planned * for Chicago's new Parkshore Tower apartments include an on - site investment counselor.
John E. Hayes Jr. was elected *-1 *PRO*-3 chairman, president and chief executive officer, *PRO*-1 succeeding David S. Black, who *T*-2 retired.
Mr. Hayes, 52 years old, left Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. *ICH*-2 in January, where he had been chairman, president and chief executive *T*-1, *PRO*-3 to join Triad Capital Partners, a St. Louis company with interests in solid waste and recycling, telecommunications and international venture capital.
He has resigned his posts at Triad *PRO*-1 to take the Kansas Power positions.
Kansas Power said 0 Mr. Black, 61, chose early retirement.
Gen. Paul X. Kelley, retired commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, was elected *-1 *PRO*-4 a director of this plastics, specialty materials and aerospace concern, *PRO*-1 succeeding Jewel Lafontant, who *T*-2 resigned *PRO*-3 to accept a government position.
Tandy Corp. said 0 it signed a definitive agreement *PRO* to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash.
The amount wasn't disclosed *-1.
The electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price *ICH*-1 at between $100 million and $200 million *U* for Datatronic's Victor microcomputer and Micronic hand - held computer subsidiaries.
In addition, Tandy will acquire rights to the Victor and Micronic names for computers.
During 1988, the Datatronic subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $200 million *U*.
The transaction will give Tandy a well - known European computer brand that *T*-1 includes 2,700 dealers and distributors marketing to medium - sized business and educational institutions.
Closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals, the company said 0 *T*-1.
Michelle Pfeiffer can't chew gum and sing at the same time.
But on the evidence of "The Fabulous Baker Boys," that may be the only thing 0 she can't do *T*-1, at least when she's acting in movies *T*-2.
As the tough, slinky lounge chanteuse in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself, and more than passably well.
Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way 0 the greats do *T*-3, like she's hearing the way 0 it should sound *T*-1 inside her head and she's concentrating on *PRO*-2 matching that internal tone.
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music.
When she isn't performing for an audience *T*-1, she prepares for a song by *PRO*-2 removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by *PRO*-2 sticking the gum back in.
Like almost everything in this wonderfully romantic and edgy movie, Ms. Pfeiffer's Susie seems like someone 0 you've seen *T*-1 before, in numerous show - biz stories (even her name, Susie Diamond, sounds like a character 0 Marilyn Monroe must have played *T*-2).
Yet nothing about "Baker Boys," and certainly nothing about Ms. Pfeiffer, really is like something from the video vault.
Steve Kloves, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for "*PRO* Racing With the Moon," a lovely *PRO* coming - of - age picture set * in the '40s.
Both movies are infused *-1 with the nostalgic sensibility of someone much older, someone who *T*-2 doesn't dismiss dreams, but who *T*-3 also has enough experience *PRO* to see his limits.
However, Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; "Baker Boys" is both bluesy and funny.
He's put a fresh spin on material that *T*-1 could come off terribly cliched; for example, the way 0 Susie wows an audience the first time 0 she sings with the Baker Boys *T*-6 *T*-2.
Of course, it *EXP*-1 doesn't hurt that Mr. Kloves has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who *T*-2 know exactly what they're doing *T*-3.
Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's slyly seductive lens work.
After *PRO*-7 working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder, the late German director, and more recently with Martin Scorsese ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style.
And Dave Grusin's witty score embraces the banal requirements of banquet - hall musicianship ("Feelings" is a must) without condescension.
Though Ms. Pfeiffer has the flashy part--she gets the best comic bits and *PRO*-1 to wear glamorous dresses and spiked heels the boys are pretty great, too.
What *T*-1 seemed like a good idea, *PRO* to cast the Bridges brothers (Jeff and Beau) as the Baker brothers, actually turned out *-2 to be a good idea.
Anyone who *T*-3's tried *PRO*-10 to appear "*-12 natural" in front of a camera knows that it *EXP*-2's much more natural *PRO* to end up *PRO*-11 looking like a stiff.
So it *EXP*-3's quite possible that the terrific play between the brothers isn't natural at all, that Jeff and Beau had *-12 to work like crazy *PRO*-13 to make their brotherly love--and resentment and frustration and rage--seem *-14 so very real.
When the movie opens *T*-14 the Baker brothers are doing what they've done *T*-1 for 15 years professionally, and twice as long as that for themselves: They're playing proficient piano, face - to - face, on twin pianos.
They're small time in the small time - hotels (not the best ones) and restaurants in Seattle.
Yet they don't disparage their audiences by *PRO*-15 disparaging their act.
They wear tuxedos most nights, unless circumstances (a regular gig at a "tropical" lounge, for example) require them *PRO*-1 to wear special costumes, like Hawaiian shirts.
Plump Beau, *PRO*-1 looking eager *PRO*-2 to please with his arched eyebrows and round face, plays the older brother, Frank.
Frank plans the program, takes care of business, and approaches the work like any other job.
He's even able *PRO*-16 to think of a job that *T*-1 takes him out of the house 300 nights a week as an ordinary job.
He's got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs; the audience sees only the house, and only near the end of the movie.
Frank grovels a little for the bookers, probably no more or less than he would have *-1 to *?* if he worked for a big corporation.
On his off - hours he wears cardigan sweaters.
Jeff Bridges is the younger brother, Jack, who *T*-1 fancies himself the rebellious artist; he lives in a loft with his sick dog and the occasional visit from the little girl upstairs, who *T*-2 climbs down the fire escape.
Yet Jack's the one who *T*-1 can remember every dive 0 they ever played *T*-2, and when, and he dutifully shows up for work night after night (he consoles himself with booze and by *PRO*-18 showing up at the last minute).
*PRO*-19 Looking leaner than he has *?* in a while, the younger Mr. Bridges's Jack is sexy and cynical and a far sadder case than Frank, who *T*-1's managed *PRO*-20 to chisel his dreams *PRO*-2 to fit reality without *PRO*-3 feeling too cheated.
He can live with little pleasures.
Mr. Kloves has put together some priceless moments.
These include Jennifer Tilly's audition *PRO* to be the Baker Boys' girl singer.
Ms. Tilly of the tweety - bird voice showed great comic promise during her stint as the mobster's girlfriend on the television show, "Hill Street Blues."
Here she delivers, especially during her enthusiastically awful rendition of the "Candy Man," which she sings *T*-2 while *PRO*-21 prancing around in a little cotton candy pink angora sweater that *T*-1 couldn't be more perfect.
(It matches her voice.)
And Ms. Pfeiffer's particular version of "*PRO* Making Whoopee"--and the way 0 Mr. Ballhaus photographs her *T*-22, from the tips of her red high heels right up her clingy red velvet dress--might make you think of Marilyn Monroe if Ms. Pfeiffer hadn't gone and become a star in her own right.
VIDEO TIP:
If you'd like *PRO*-23 to see the first time 0 Michelle Pfeiffer sang on screen *T*-24, and you have a lot of patience, *PRO* take a look at "Grease 2."
You'll find her there.
Better yet, *PRO* check out the emergence of her comic persona in "*PRO* Married *-1 to the Mob," Jonathan Demme's delightful Mafia comedy.
The government said 0 13.1% of Americans, or 31.9 million people, were living in poverty in 1988.
While last year's figure was down from 13.4% in 1987 and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate, the Census Bureau said 0 the 1988 drop wasn't statistically significant.
The bureau's report also showed that while some measures of the nation's economic well - being improved modestly in 1988, the fruits of prosperity were shared *-1 less equitably than the year before.
*PRO*-1 Summarizing data derived * from a March 1989 survey of 58,000 households, William Butz, associate director of the Census Bureau, said that "most groups either stayed the same or improved."
But, he added 0 *?*, "Since the late 1960s, the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal.
There was no reversal {of that trend} between 1987 and 1988."
Per capita income, a widely used measure of a nation's economic health, hit a record in 1988, *PRO*-1 rising 1.7% after inflation adjustment to $13,120 *U*.
But the median income of American families fell 0.2%, the first time 0 it has failed *-1 to rise *T*-2 since 1982.
Mr. Butz said 0 the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure, including the rising number of female - headed families and a sharp increase in income reported * by Americans who *T*-1 aren't living in families.
As a result of last year's decline, the government's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about 500,000.
The poverty threshold, defined * as three times food expenses as *PRO* calculated *-1 by the Agricultural Department, last year was $12,092 *U* for a family of four.
The Census Bureau counts all cash income in *PRO*-1 determining whether families are below the line, but it doesn't consider other government benefits, such as Medicare.
Thanks largely to the continued growth of the U.S. economy, the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the 1983 peak of 15.3%, but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years.
Poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other Americans.
In 1988, 31.6% of blacks lived in poverty, compared with 10.1% for whites and 26.8% for Hispanics.
But two - thirds of all poor Americans were white.
More than half of poor families were headed *-1 by women living without men, the bureau said 0 *T*-2.
More than three - fourths of poor black families were headed *-1 by women.
The poverty rate of children under 18 years old dropped last year to 19.7% from 20.5% in 1987, but remained far higher than a decade ago.
The rate among the elderly--12% in 1988--wasn't significantly lower than the year before.
If it weren't for Social Security payments, more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line, Mr. Butz said 0 *T*-1.
The Census Bureau also said:
-- Some 17.2% of all money income received * by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.
That is the greatest share reported * for any year since 1950, although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison.
-- The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.
The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier.
-- *PRO* Confirming other government data showing that wages aren't keeping pace with inflation, earnings of year - round, full - time male workers fell 1.3% in 1988 after *PRO* adjusting for higher prices, the first such drop since 1982.
Earnings of female workers were unchanged.
-- Women working full - time earned 66 cents for every dollar earned * by men, a penny more than in 1987 and seven cents more than in 1978.
-- Median household income--which *T*-1 includes both those living in families and those who *T*-2 aren't *?*--rose 0.3% last year to $27,225 *U* after inflation.
It rose sharply in the Northeast and Midwest and fell slightly in the South and West.
Median family income was $32,191 *U*, down 0.2%.
-- Per capita income of blacks, though *PRO*-1 still only 60% that of whites, rose 3.9% in 1988, while per capita income of whites rose only 1.5%.
-- Among married couples, the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply, as income of black families shot up 6.8% while income of whites didn't budge.
*PRO*-2 Fueling a controversy that *T*-1 has been simmering for years, the Census Bureau also said 0 its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold *PRO*-3 using an improved consumer - price measure adopted * in 1983.
The bureau said 0 some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988--and the poverty rate would have been 10.5% instead of 13.1%--under the alternative calculation.
Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years.
A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released * yesterday concluded, "It *EXP*-1 is misleading *PRO* to make this change without *PRO*-2 adjusting for other changes."
The official poverty threshold is set *-1 by the Office of Management and Budget.
One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention.
The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen * in the postwar years.
Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing *T*-1 is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed * by the Turks in the 16th century.
Today's Turks in Bulgaria, in other words, deserve what *T*-1 is coming to them four centuries later.
As if this weren't enough, the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act.
On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the "National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915 - 1923," suffered * at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire.
There can be no *PRO* quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering, but one has *-2 to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve *T*-1.
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that *T*-1 has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in *PRO*-1 resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that *T*-3 may lead to membership in the European Community *T*-2.
Turkey has been fighting its past for years, and thus far has been only partially successful.
Must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the genocide of another people?
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that *T*-1 surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in *PRO*-3 dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis *T*-2.
Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans.
Part of the problem 0 some Europeans have *T*-1 with Turkey seems *-2 to stem from its location--Turkey isn't really part of Europe.
Why, they wonder 0 *?*, should it belong to the EC *T*-2?
Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told *-1 0 *?*, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo - Christian tradition.
It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears *T*-2 that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore.
No one has *-1 to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire *PRO*-1 to reject that argument.
Turkey in any event is long past it.
The country has in recent years accepted more than 500,000 refugees from at least four bordering nations.
Kurds, *PRO*-2 suffering what many people consider *T*-1 to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria, Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey.
Now it is their fellow Turks arriving as refugees from Bulgaria.
The Turkish refugee tragedy and the ongoing crisis cannot be ignored *-2 and shuttled *-2 off to that notorious dustbin of history that *T*-1 has become so convenient recently.
Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time cannot be simply filed away *-1 and forgotten *-1.
But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done *T*-1 in *PRO*-2 supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end; it merely produces more controversy and embittered memories.
Congress has enough difficulty *PRO*-1 dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists.
Bulgaria's government has been behaving beyond the pale for months, and the U.S. does its values no credit by *PRO*-2 ignoring that while *PRO*-1 casting its votes into the past.
General Dynamics Corp. was awarded *-1 contracts totaling $589 million *U* for one Navy Trident submarine and for Air Force research on the National Aerospace plane.
Grumman Corp. won a $58.9 million *U* Navy contract for 12 F - 14 aircraft.
Raytheon Co. was issued *-1 a $19.2 million *U* Air Force contract for support of the Milstar communications satellite.
McDonnell Douglas Corp. got a $12.5 million *U* Air Force contract for support work on the National Aerospace plane.
As the citizens of San Francisco and surrounding communities began *-1 assessing the damage from Tuesday's devastating earthquake, NBC News began *-2 assessing the damage from what some said 0 *T*-4 was a failure *PRO* to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake's initial moments.
"In terms of coverage, it was a disaster equal to the earthquakes," said *T*-2 Eric Premner, president for broadcasting of King Broadcasting Co., which *T*-1 owns the NBC affiliate in Seattle, Wash.
While rival ABC News outstripped the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck--the network was broadcasting the World Series from Candlestick Park when the quake struck *T*-1--NBC News was unable *PRO*-2 to get its signal out of San Francisco for the first hour after the quake.
"I have *-2 to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster," said *T*-1 Mr. Premner.
"So before I start *-2 to be really critical of NBC, I would like *PRO*-3 to know more about what *T*-1 happened."
There were no complaints from affiliates of CBS Inc. and Cable News Network, a unit of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
But that was not the case at NBC News, which *T*-2 has been dogged *-1 with the image of *PRO*-1 not being aggressive on major breaking stories.
Last summer, the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student uprising in China.
"I was not pleased *-2 with the slow start, and neither was NBC News *?*," said *T*-1 Guy Hempel, general manager of NBC affiliate WAVE in Louisville, Ky.
A spokesman for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., said 0 the network was "looking into what *T*-1 happened."
The stations said 0 they were pleased *-1 with the extended coverage yesterday, including a special five - hour edition of "Today."
Don Browne, director of news at NBC News, said in an interview that "we couldn't get a signal out of San Francisco.
We were out of the box.
It was horrible.
The comment 0 we're hearing *T*-1 is that we were slow out of the box, but beat everyone else in the stretch."
NBC broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday.
The quake postponed the third and fourth games of the World Series.
In place of the games, ABC said 0 it planned *PRO*-1 to broadcast next week's episodes of its prime - time Wednesday and Thursday lineups, except for a one - hour special on the earthquake at 10 p.m. last night.
The series is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to resume Tuesday evening in San Francisco.
"There are no commercials 0 *PRO* to make up for *T*-1 since we're going *-2 to eventually broadcast the World Series," said *T*-3 a network spokesman.
Whitbread & Co. put its spirits division up for sale, *PRO*-2 triggering a scramble among global groups for the British company's brands.
Whitbread already has been approached *-1 by "about half a dozen" companies interested in *PRO* buying all or part of the spirits business, a spokesman said 0 *T*-3.
Analysts expect the spirits operations and some California vineyards that *T*-2 also are being sold *-1 to fetch about #500 million *U* ($788.8 million *U*).
Among the brands for sale are *T*-1 Beefeater gin, the No. 2 imported gin in the U.S., and Laphroaig single - malt whiskey.
Also for sale are *T*-2 Buckingham Wile Co., which *T*-1 distributes Cutty Sark blended whiskey in the U.S., and Whitbread's Atlas Peak Vineyards in California's Napa Valley.
Beefeater alone is worth as much as #300 million *U*, analysts said 0 *T*-1.
Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for #174.5 million *U*.
That purchase represented an attempt *ICH*-1 by Whitbread, a venerable British brewer, *PRO* to become a major player in the global liquor business.
But Whitbread has been squeezed *-1 by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry.
Now, it wants *PRO*-1 to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations.
For rival liquor companies, the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity *PRO* to acquire valuable brands.
"It's not very often 0 something like this comes up *T*-2," said *T*-1 Ron Littleboy, a liquor company analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London.
"The division will be sold *-1 off quite rapidly," predicted *T*-2 Neill Junor, an analyst at London brokers County NatWest WoodMac.
Among possible buyers, Grand Metropolitan PLC might find Beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio.
Grand Met owns Bombay gin, the No. 3 imported gin in the U.S.; rival Guinness PLC has the No. 1 imported brand, Tanqueray.
The Whitbread spirits auction "is an extremely interesting development...and naturally we'll be considering it carefully," a Grand Met spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Guinness, which *T*-2 owns several leading whiskey brands plus Gordon's gin, the world's No. 1 gin, is considered *-1 less likely *PRO*-3 to bid for the Whitbread spirits.
A Guinness spokesman declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Two other global liquor giants, Canada's Seagram Co. and Britain's Allied - Lyons PLC, also are possible buyers.
Seagram's gin is the world's No. 2 gin brand, but the company doesn't own any of the major gin brands imported * in the U.S. .
Allied - Lyons, while *PRO*-1 powerful in whiskey, doesn't own any major white - spirit brands.
"We will certainly have *-2 to take a look at" the Whitbread spirits business, an Allied - Lyons spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
"We would certainly like *PRO*-1 to have a major white - spirits brand in our portfolio."
A Seagram spokesman in New York wouldn't comment.
Smaller liquor companies, such as Brown - Forman Corp. and American Brands Inc. of the U.S., also are likely *-1 to be interested.
Such companies "are increasingly being left *-1 behind" in the global liquor business, says 0 *T*-2 Nomura's Mr. Littleboy.
In New York, a spokesman for American Brands wouldn't comment.
Brown - Forman, a Louisville, Ky. distiller, also declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Whitbread's wine, spirits and soft - drink operations had trading profit of #35.4 million *U* on sales of #315.5 million *U* in the year ended Feb. 25.
The company, which *T*-1 is retaining most of its wine *RNR*-2 and all of its soft - drink *RNR*-2 interests, didn't break out results for the businesses 0 it plans *PRO*-4 to sell *T*-3.
But analysts estimate their trading profit at #30 million *U*.
Whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended Feb. 25 of #223.2 million *U*, on sales of #2.26 billion *U*.
Whitbread's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel shakeup in the British beer industry.
Earlier this year, the government announced plans *PRO* to foster increased competition in the industry.
British brewers currently own thousands of pubs, which *T*-1 in turn sell only the breweries' beer and soft drinks.
Under new rules, many of the country's pubs would become "free houses," *PRO*-1 selling beers of their choice.
Whitbread now intends *PRO*-1 to bolster its brewing interests, in an effort *PRO* to grab a share of sales to free houses.
The company, which *T*-1 last month paid #50.7 million *U* for regional British brewer Boddington Group PLC, has about 13% of the British beer market.
Whitbread also owns the license *PRO* to brew and distribute Heineken and Stella Artois beers in Britain.
In addition, Whitbread intends *PRO*-1 to focus on its newer hotel, liquor store and restaurant businesses in Europe and North America.
In Britain, those interests include the Beefeater steakhouse chain and joint ownership with PepsiCo Inc. of the country's Pizza Hut chain.
In Canada and the U.S., Whitbread owns The Keg chain of steak and seafood restaurants.
*PRO* Focusing on beer, restaurants and hotels means 0 "we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively," Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's managing director, said 0 *T*-1 in a statement.
The spirits business "would require substantial additional investment *PRO* to enable it *PRO*-1 to compete effectively in the first division of global players."
Whitbread also announced that Mr. Jarvis, who *T*-1 is 48, will become the company's chief executive March 1.
At that time Sam Whitbread, the company's chairman and a descendant of its 18th - century founder, will retire from executive duties.
He will retain the honorary title of non-executive chairman.
From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second - deadliest earthquake in U.S. history, a scene of devastation *ICH*-1 emerges: a freeway crumbled * into a concrete sandwich, hoses pumping water into once - fashionable apartments, abandoned autos.
But this quake wasn't the big one, the replay of 1906 that *T*-2 has been feared *-1 for so many years.
Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives, and damage estimated * in the billions, most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area weren't greatly affected *-1.
The economic life of the region is expected *-1 to revive in a day or two, although some transportation problems may last weeks or months.
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter--20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland.
Also, the region's insistence on strict building codes helped *PRO*-1 prevent wider damage.
The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated *-1 by the distance, so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage--broken windows, falling brick and cornices, buckled asphalt or sidewalks.
Of course, the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation's capital of high technology.
Like other major American cities, the San Francisco--Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber - optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world's great natural harbors.
When the tremors struck *T*-1, the region's largely unseen high - tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air.
Michael L. Bandler, vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co., says 0 nearly all the network's computer switches, which *T*-1 move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power *T*-2.
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours, but that gave emergency crews time 0 *PRO* to turn on an emergency system that *T*-1 runs primarily on diesel fuel *T*-2.
Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell's network, only four *T*-1 went down.
One of those was in Hollister, Calif., near the earthquake's epicenter.
Few telephone lines snapped.
That's because the widely used fiber - optic cable has been installed *-1 underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.
The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated * by an earthquake.
Nevertheless, phone service was sporadic; many computer terminals remained dark, and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power.
Business in the nation's fourth - largest metropolitan region was nearly paralyzed *-1; an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home.
The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself, as virtually all businesses shut down.
The $125 - billion - *U* a - year Bay area economy represents one - fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto.
In high - tech, the Bay area accounts for 15% to 20% of the U.S. computer - related industry.
"This has been a major disruption for the Bay area economy," says *T*-1 Pauline Sweezey, the chief economist at the California Department of Finance.
"Obviously, things are going *-1 to have *-2 to go on hold for many companies."
The damage to the Bay area's roadways could cause significant economic hardship.
A quarter of a million people *ICH*-1 cross the Bay Bridge every day, far more than the 100,000 that *T*-5 use the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART)--which *T*-6 was working but wasn't stopping in the city's Financial District yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut *-3 off and the area was being checked *-4 for gas leaks.
California state transportation officials interviewed * by telephone say 0 they nevertheless don't expect serious problems for commerce in *RNR*-1 and out of *RNR*-1 the Bay area.
All major roadways except Interstate 880, known * as the Nimitz Freeway, and the Bay Bridge were open by 1 p.m. yesterday.
Officials expect difficulty *PRO*-1 routing traffic through downtown San Francisco.
The earthquake caused many streets to *PRO*-1 buckle and crack, *PRO*-2 making them impassible.
Other roads were obstructed *-1 by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines, an emergency relief spokesman says 0 *T*-2.
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $2 billion *U*.
But many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short - lived.
Of the scores of companies contacted * by this newspaper, few reported any damage that they didn't expect *PRO*-1 to have *-2 remedied *T*-3 within a day or two.
It *EXP*-3 is possible, of course, that some of the most seriously damaged companies couldn't be reached *-4, particularly in areas nearest the epicenter.
Typical, perhaps, was *T*-1 the situation at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the General Motors Corp. - Toyota joint - venture auto plant in Fremont, about 35 miles south of Oakland.
Ten of the plant's workers were injured *-1 when the quake hit about a half - hour into the afternoon shift *T*-3; seven were hospitalized *-2.
Metal racks on the plant floor fell over, and water mains ruptured, a spokeswoman says 0 *T*-1.
The plant was evacuated *-1 and workers sent *-2 home.
But the plant was able *PRO*-1 to resume limited production of its Toyota Corollas and Geo Prizms by 6 a.m. yesterday, and absenteeism was only 7% of the work force, about twice normal.
Computer maker Hewlett - Packard Co., based * in Palo Alto, says 0 one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked *-1 off its foundation *T*-2.
Other buildings had broken glass, dangling light fixtures and broken pipes, a spokesperson says 0 *T*-1, *PRO*-2 estimating the cost of reconstruction "in the millions."
Most banks were closed but were expected *-1 to reopen today with few problems anticipated *-2.
At the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Vice President Robert Fienberg says 0 operations were "steaming along as usual" yesterday afternoon.
` When the quake hit *T*-2, we turned on our emergency generator and brought our computers up," he says *T*-1.
The Fed serves as a middleman for banks, *PRO*-2 taking checks from one bank and sending them to another, an operation that it handled *T*-1 smoothly Tuesday night after the quake.
"The volume 0 we received *T*-1 from the banks was a lot lower than usual," he says *T*-2.
A disaster - contingency plan in which the Los Angeles Fed would come to San Francisco's aid *T*-1 wasn't needed *-3, he adds 0 *T*-2.
Most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from congestion.
The telephone network simply couldn't handle the large number of people seeking *PRO* to make a call at the same time.
The volume resulted in dial - tone delays that *T*-1 were as short as 15 seconds and as long as five minutes.
Mr. Bandler puts traffic volume at 10 to 50 times normal.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Inc. and United Telecommunications' U S Sprint unit were blocking phone calls into the Bay area *PRO*-1 to alleviate congestion.
The companies block traffic much as highway on - ramps are blocked *-1 when traffic backs up *T*-2.
William E. Downing, Pacific Bell's vice president of customer services for the Bay area, says 0 most long - distance companies were blocking about 50% of all calls.
Pacific Telesis says 0 its Pacific Bell unit also was blocking about 50% of its calls locally.
Ironically, the long - term effect of the earthquake may be *PRO*-1 to bolster the Bay area's economic fortunes and, indeed, the nation's gross national product.
It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double - deck highways.
"It would in the near - term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people 0 *T*-1 to help," says *T*-2 Beth Burnham Mace, a regional economist at DRI / McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
The construction industry is sure *-1 to feel increased demand.
"There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state, federal and local employment," Ms. Mace says *T*-1.
Adds *ICH*-1 Stacy Kotman, an economist at Georgia State University, "There's nothing positive about an earthquake, but it will probably generate more construction activity."
Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by *PRO*-1 bidding up stocks of construction and related companies.
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc., a cement maker, rose sharply in anticipation of stepped - up demand.
In Greenwich, Conn., Lone Star spokesman Michael London says, 0 "Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely *-3 to be construction projects that *T*-1 wouldn't otherwise have been anticipated *-2.
But any increase isn't likely *-1 to be any kind of a surge.
It's something likely *PRO* to be spread *-1 out over a long period of time.
There will be a lot of repair work that *T*-1 won't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new constructon would *?* *T*-2."
Lone Star's San Francisco facilities weren't damaged *-1 in the quake.
The earthquake is likely *-1 to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins.
The first effects are, of course, negative as work is disrupted *-1 and people lose income and cut spending.
Corporate profits may also dip initially.
Many of the lost tourism dollars won't be recovered *-1; many trips delayed * never take place.
Subsequently, however, the ill effects are likely *-2 to be offset *-1, at least in economic terms, as construction activity begins.
Because of the way 0 the government keeps its books *T*-2, the damage to the Bay Bridge, however costly, won't be counted *-1 as a minus.
The money spent * on repairs will be counted *-1 as a plus.
"It *EXP*-1's very difficult *PRO* to model the long - term impact of this," says *T*-3 Andrew Goldberg, who *T*-2 studies the public - policy and crisis - management aspects of earthquakes at the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington, D.C.
"You certainly can say 0 it's going *-1 to be extremely severe.
We really are talking about *PRO* shutting down a major American city for a number of days, maybe for a few weeks."
Mr. Goldberg says 0 the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $1 billion *U* and could reach $4 billion *U*.
He cautions that early damage estimates are often low; the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received *-1.
The earthquake damage, of course, would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco.
A direct hit on a major city, Mr. Goldberg figures 0 *?*, would cause $20 billion *U* to $40 billion *U* of damage.
Experts caution that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake's total damage, but it *EXP*-2's clear that insurers are likely *-1 to pay out enormous sums.
Jack Byrne, the chairman of Fireman's Fund Corp., which *T*-2 is based *-1 in Novato, Calif., estimates 0 insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $2 billion *U*.
The impact on the insurance industry "will be big and harsh, but less than {Hurricane} Hugo," says 0 *T*-2 Mr. Byrne, who *T*-1 toured the Bay area by car yesterday afternoon *PRO*-3 to get a sense of the company's exposure to the earthquake.
Mr. Byrne says 0 Fireman's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million *U*.
The company was able *PRO*-2 to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property 0 it insures *T*-1.
Fireman's Fund had claims adjusters on the streets of San Francisco right after sunrise yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could *?* right on the spot.
Fireman's Fund insures 37,300 homes and autos and 35,000 businesses in the Bay area.
In addition to *PRO*-1 paying for earthquake and fire damage, the insurer must cover worker - compensation claims and also losses due to businesses being shut *-2 down by lack of power or phone service.
But many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage 0 *PRO* to pay for damages to their property *T*-1.
The Independent Insurance Agents of America says 0 fewer than one of every five California homeowners has earthquake insurance.
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection, but the great majority aren't covered *-1.
Earthquake insurance typically runs $200 or more *U* a year for a small house.
Whatever the long - term economic effect *T*-1, the scene from the helicopter above Oakland is one of tragedy.
Gargantuan sections of a double - decker freeway have been heaved *-1 about like plastic building blocks.
Atop them sit *T*-1 cars and trucks abandoned * in a terrifying scramble *PRO* to safety the day before.
In areas where the freeway made giant concrete sandwiches of itself *T*-3 lie *T*-4 cars that police say 0 *T*-2 have been flattened *-1 into foot - thick slabs.
On the periphery, rescue workers seem, from the air, *-1 to move in slow motion.
They peck away at the 1 1/2 - mile section of rubble, *PRO*-1 searching for more of the 250 people thought *PRO* to have died here.
About 20 other deaths were also attributed *-1 to the earthquake.
The heart of the earthquake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was 50 miles to the south, near Santa Cruz, but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway, a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco.
Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District.
Just a short span across the bay to the west, the quake also showed its mettle: A four - square - block area of the Marina District lies *PRO*-1 smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped * onto rubble *PRO* to prevent it from *PRO*-2 blazing anew.
Many of the buildings, mostly condominiums and apartments, were flattened *-1 almost instantly as the underlying soil--much of it landfill--was literally turned *-2 to ooze by the quake's intensive shaking, *PRO* rupturing gas lines.
Onlookers say 0 three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck *T*-1.
Efforts *PRO* to fight the blaze were hampered *-1 because water mains were severed *-2 as well.
From the air, ribbons of yellow fire hose carry water from the bay to high - pressure nozzles trained * on the site.
As onlookers stand behind barricades, helmeted firemen and building inspectors survey rows of nearby buildings that *T*-1 were twisted *-2 from their foundations and seem *-2 on the verge of collapse.
In the Marina District, residents spent yesterday *PRO* assessing damage, cleaning up and trying *PRO*-1 to find friends and neighbors.
Evelyn Boccone, 85 years old, has lived in the district most of her life.
Her parents lost everything in the 1906 earthquake.
"Now, we realize what our mothers must have gone through *T*-1," she says *T*-2.
"We always heard about the earthquake, but as children we didn't always listen.
Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France reportedly plan *PRO*-2 to form an international air - freight company this year, a move that *T*-1 could further consolidate the industry.
Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the three giants plan *PRO*-1 to integrate their cargo computers and ground - cargo and air - cargo systems.
They reportedly will invest a total of 20 billion yen ($140 million *U*) in the venture, whose headquarters *T*-1 would be in France or West Germany.
The action follows Federal Express Corp.'s acquisition of Flying Tiger Line Inc. in August.
After that, "it *EXP*-1 would make sense for airlines to talk about *PRO*-3 doing things jointly," said 0 *T*-2 Cotton Daly, director of cargo services for New York consulting firm Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc.
Mr. Daly said 0 such discussions are motivated *-1 by the competitive threat posed * by Federal Express, United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other fast - growing air - freight companies.
Many airlines are talking about cargo ventures, and there have been rumors about such a tie between JAL and European airlines.
In Tokyo, a JAL spokesman said 0 he couldn't confirm or deny the latest Japanese report.
But he said 0 JAL is talking to Lufthansa and Air France about some sort of cargo venture.
"It is just one of a number of strategies 0 JAL has embarked upon *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to come to terms with the situation in Europe after 1992," the deadline for *PRO* ending trade barriers in the EC, he said 0 *T*-1.
In Frankfurt, a Lufthansa spokesman confirmed 0 talks are under way, but declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
A Lufthansa spokeswoman in Tokyo said 0 the head of Lufthansa's cargo operations had been in Toyko last week for talks with JAL.
In Paris, Air France declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
"Nothing is defined or signed *-1 at this point," Mr. Daly said *T*-2 of the talks.
Whatever accord the three carriers reach *T*-1, he said 0 *?*, he is skeptical 0 it would create a separate airline.
If the three companies pool their air - freight businesses, their clout would be considerable.
According to figures from the International Air Transport Association, they carried a combined 1.8 million tons of freight last year.
Federal Express and Flying Tiger, as separate companies, carried a combined 2.6 million tons.
Air France and Lufthansa last month concluded a far - reaching cooperation accord that *T*-1 includes air - freight activities.
They plan *PRO*-1 to increase cooperation in freight ground - handling and create a world - wide computer system 0 *T*-2 to process cargo.
Other airlines would have access to the system, they said 0 *?*, and negotiations with partners were already under way.
Both European airlines operate extensive fleets of Boeing 747 freighters and 747 Combis, aircraft that *T*-1 carry both freight and passengers on the main deck.
They currently have large orders for cargo planes.
Several airlines, including Lufthansa, JAL and Cathay Pacific Airways, are working on a so - called global cargo system and are trying *PRO*-2 to attract other carriers to join, Mr. Daly said 0 *T*-1.
JAL also has signaled 0 it is looking for toeholds in Europe before the end of 1992.
Last month, the carrier said 0 it wanted *PRO*-1 to lease crews and planes from British Airways so it could funnel its passengers from London to other European destinations.
British Airways said 0 it hasn't received a proposal from JAL.
But last week there were air - traffic negotiations between the U.K. and Japan, a likely first step to any commercial agreement between JAL and British Airways or another U.K. carrier.
G.D. Searle & Co., a Monsanto Co. unit, is launching a program 0 *T*-2 to give consumers more information about its drugs when doctors prescribe them *T*-1.
*PRO*-3 Called *-1 *PRO*-5 Patients in the Know, the program features fact sheets designed *PRO*-2 to be easy 0 *PRO* to understand *T*-4.
The sheets tell how the medicine works *T*-1, describe how *PRO* to use it *T*-2 and list its possible side effects.
They are designed *PRO*-3 to be given *-1 to patients by their doctors when the medicines are prescribed *-2 *T*-4 and include space 0 for the doctor to *PRO*-5 write special instructions *T*-6.
In addition, Searle will give pharmacists brochures on the use of prescription drugs for distribution in their stores.
Consumer groups have long advocated that drug companies and doctors make more information available to patients.
"We believe that every drug that *T*-1's marketed *-3 to a consumer should have a consumer label," said *T*-2 Douglas Teich of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader affiliate.
Dr. Teich said 0 Searle is "the only company 0 I know *T*-2 that *T*-1 voluntarily" will make consumer information available.
According to federal officials and drug - industry studies, nearly half of the 1.6 billion prescriptions filled * each year aren't used *-3 properly, *PRO* meaning that money is wasted *-1 on some prescriptions and patients are deprived *-2 of the benefits of medication.
"We think 0 it *EXP*-1's very important *PRO* to provide as much information as possible on the drugs 0 consumers take *T*-2," said *T*-3 Searle Chairman Sheldon Gilgore.
PRINCE HENRI is the crown prince and hereditary grand duke of Luxembourg.
An article in the World Business Report of Sept. 22 editions incorrectly referred to his father, Grand Duke Jean, as the crown prince.
Four years ago, Pittsburgh was designated *-1 *PRO*-3 the most - livable U.S. city by Rand McNally's Places Rated Almanac, and the honor did wonders *PRO*-2 to improve Pittsburgh's soot - stained image.
"People asked, is it really true?" says *T*-2 Maury Kelley, vice president, marketing services, for Beecham Products USA, a maker of health and personal - care products that *T*-1 used the ranking in its recruiting brochure.
Yuba City, Calif., meanwhile, ranked *PRO*-1 dead last among 329 metro areas.
*PRO*-2 Unamused, residents burned Rand McNally books and wore T - shirts that *T*-1 said: "*PRO* Kiss my Atlas."
The almanac will be making new friends and enemies on Oct. 27, when an updated version will be released *-1 *T*-2.
Pittsburgh figures 0 it will be dethroned *-1 but plans *PRO*-2 to accept its ouster graciously.
The city's Office of Promotion plans media events 0 *T*-1 to welcome its successor.
"We're encouraging a graceful transition," says *T*-1 Mary Kay Poppenberg, the organization's president.
"Our attitude is that (the ranking) is like Miss America.
Once you're Miss America, you're always Miss America."
*PRO* Tell that to Atlanta, which Pittsburgh replaced *T*-1 as the most - livable city in 1985.
Many Atlantans thought 0 Pittsburgh was an unworthy heir.
A columnist in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution wrote: "Who *T*-1 did the research for this report?
Two guys from Gary, Ind.?"
Not so.
Co-authors David Savageau and Richard Boyer, live in Gloucester, Mass., and Asheville, N.C., respectively.
"Atlanta," Mr. Savageau sniffs *?*, "has unrealistic pretensions to world - class status."
The new edition lists the top 10 metropolitan areas as Anaheim - Santa Ana, Calif.; Boston; Louisville, Ky.; Nassau - Suffolk, N.Y.; New York; Pittsburgh; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle; and Washington.
Mr. Savageau says 0 earthquake or not, San Francisco makes the list.
But attention also rivets on who *T*-1 finishes last, and Pine Bluff, Ark.--which *T*-2 finished third to last in 1981 and second to last in 1985--is certainly in the running.
"I hate *PRO*-1 to dignify the publication by *PRO*-1 commenting on the obscene rating," Mayor Carolyn Robinson says *T*-4, *PRO*-2 adding that cities have no way 0 *PRO* to rebut the book *T*-5.

You don't know which way *PRO* to punch *T*-1.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said 0 it fined Capcom Futures Inc. $500,000 *U* and accepted its withdrawal from membership as part of a settlement of disciplinary actions against the firm.
Capcom Futures is a Chicago subsidiary of Capcom Financial Services Ltd., a London financial firm that *T*-2 was implicated *-1 last year in a scheme *PRO* to launder drug money.
The case is pending.
The firm was indicted *-1 in Tampa, Fla., on money - laundering charges.
In June, the Chicago Board of Trade said 0 it suspended Capcom Financial.
The Capcom Futures unit withdrew from Board of Trade membership voluntarily in August, a Board of Trade spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
Capcom Futures, while *PRO*-2 neither admitting nor denying the Merc charges, said in a statement that the Merc charges were "technical in nature" and that "no customers were hurt *-1" as a result of the violations cited * by the Merc.
The Merc alleged that, among other things, from April 1987 through October 1988 Capcom Futures failed *-1 to document trades between Capcom Futures and people or entities directly or indirectly controlled * by Capcom Futures shareholders.
Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y., and Digital Equipment Corp. said 0 they agreed *PRO*-1 to jointly develop software 0 *T*-2 to help *PRO*-3 manage Digital's Vax computers.
Computer Associates has carved out a huge business *PRO*-1 selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs *-1 to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year.
The market for system - management software for Digital's hardware is fragmented *-1 enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there.
At the same time, the market is smaller than the market for IBM - compatible software.
For one thing, Digital, Maynard, Mass., has sold fewer machines.
In addition, its machines are typically easier 0 *PRO* to operate *T*-1, so customers require less assistance from software.
Federal Paper Board Co. said 0 it completed the previously announced purchase of Imperial Cup Corp., a closely held maker of paper cups based * in Kenton, Ohio.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Imperial Cup has annual sales of approximately $75 million *U*.
Federal Paper Board sells paper and wood products.
Control Data Corp. agreed *PRO*-1 to sell its idle supercomputer manufacturing plant here to Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. for $5.8 million *U*.
The tentative agreement calls for 3M to use the 115,000 - square - foot plant and 19 acres of land for research laboratories.
Control Data has been seeking a buyer for the facility since it folded its ETA Systems Inc. supercomputer unit this past April.
A group of investors, including Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. and Sasea Holding S.A., have agreed *PRO*-1 to buy 76.66% of Odeon Finanziaria, a financially troubled Italian TV station.
Florio Fiorini, managing director of Geneva - based Sasea, said 0 the investors would pay only a symbolic one lira for the station, "but we have agreed *PRO*-2 to raise the capital that *T*-1 will enable the company to continue *-3 operating.
It's sort of a Chapter 11 situation," he added *T*-3, *PRO*-2 referring to the U.S. bankruptcy law that *T*-1 protects companies from creditors while they restructure.
Milan - based Odeon, which *T*-1 draws about 3% of Italian TV viewers, has debt of 250 billion lire ($181.9 million *U*), Mr. Fiorini said 0 *T*-2.
He added that details of the recapitalization still have *-3 to be worked *-1 out, but that Pathe will take 50% of Odeon, Rome film producer Bruno Lucisano will take 10% and the remaining 16.66%, currently owned * by Sasea, will eventually be sold *-2 to other investors.
Calisto Tanzi, Odeon's owner, will retain his 23.34% stake.
Italy's Supreme Court this year ordered Parliament *PRO*-2 to write a law that *T*-1 will regulate media ownership.
"We think that it *EXP*-1's going *-4 to be far more favorable *ICH*-6 *PRO* to own a station before the law is passed *-3 than *PRO* to try *PRO*-2 to buy one afterward," Mr. Fiorini said *T*-5.
NEWHALL LAND & FARMING Co., Valencia, Calif., announced a 2 - for - 1 split in the real estate limited partnership's units and increased its regular quarterly cash distribution 33%, to 40 cents a unit.
The real estate limited partnership also said 0 it will pay a special year - end cash distribution of 10 cents a unit.
Both distributions are payable Dec. 4 to limited partners of record Nov. 3.
Senate Republicans have settled on a proposal that *T*-1 would cut the capital - gains tax for individuals and corporations.
At the same time, a small group of Senate Democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon.
Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), the lead sponsor of the GOP proposal, said 0 he intends *PRO*-2 to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation *T*-1 comes along, particularly this month's bill 0 *T*-3 to raise the federal borrowing limit.
He gave 10 - to - 1 odds that a capital - gains tax cut of some sort would be approved *-2 this year, though it probably won't be included *-3 in the pending deficit - reduction bill.
He added that he expects *PRO*-2 to talk to the Democrats who *T*-1 also wanted *PRO*-3 to *PRO*-4 cut the gains tax about *PRO* drafting a joint proposal.
For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held * for more than one year.
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year 0 the asset was held *-1 *T*-2 until it reached a maximum of 35%.
The exclusion would apply to assets sold * after Oct. 1, 1989.
As an alternative, he said 0 *?*, taxpayers could chose *PRO*-1 to reduce their gains by an inflation index.
For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held * for more than three years would be cut *-1 to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.
That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held * for 15 years.
The Packwood plan would also include a proposal, designed * by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that *T*-1 would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts.
The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn *-1 *PRO*-3 tax - free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home and *PRO* to pay education and medical expenses *T*-2.
Current IRAs could be rolled *-1 over into the new IRAs but would be subject to tax.
For their part, the group of Democrats are working on a plan that, like the Packwood proposal, *T*-2 would grant larger exclusions to assets the longer 0 they were held *-1 by individuals and companies.
Newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held *.
An extra exclusion would be given *-1 to long - held stock in small and medium - size corporations just starting up.
No one in the Senate is considering the capital - gains plan passed * by the House.
That plan would provide a 30% exclusion to assets sold * over a 2 1/2 - year period ending Dec. 31, 1991.
After then, the House measure would boost the tax rate to 28% and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation.
Senators are focusing on *PRO*-1 making a capital - gains differential permanent.
Separately, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill .) of the House Ways and Means Committee said 0 he didn't want the capital - gains tax cut or any other amendments attached * to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit.
The current debt limit expires Oct. 31.
He also urged House and Senate negotiators *PRO*-2 to rid the deficit - reduction bill of all provisions that *T*-1 increase the budget deficit, including the House - passed capital - gains provision.
Natural upheavals, and most particularly earthquakes, are not only horrible realities in and of themselves, but also symbols through which the state of a society can be construed *-1 *T*-2.
The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed, quite literally, a city whose larger structures *T*-2 had been built *-1 with sand.
The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference.
The larger parallel after the earthquake centered * south of San Francisco is surely with the state of the U.S. economy.
Did the stock - market tremors of Friday, Oct. 13, presage larger fragility, far greater upheavals?
Are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the spans of the Bay Bridge?
The eerie complacency of the Reagan - Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements.
A licensed government intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so *PRO* to speak *T*-1, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization.
His observations were taken *-1 seriously.
But we are, in reality, witnessing the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism: not so much the end of history but the history of the end.
The financial equivalent of the sand used * by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy - outs associated * with them.
Builders get away with *PRO*-3 using sand and financiers junk when society decides 0 it *EXP*-1's okay, necessary even, *PRO* to look the other way *T*-2.
And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason 0 *PRO*-2 to welcome junk bonds, to look the other way *T*-1.
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment.
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate--net pretax profits divided * by capital stock--peaked in 1965 at 17.2%.
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that *T*-1 followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987.
Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was *T*-1--in the early 1980s--the drop in the number arrived at * if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated * with Prof. James Tobin.
In theory, the value attached * to a firm by the market and the cost of *PRO* replacing its assets should be the same.
But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock--its assets--means nothing if the firm is not producing profits.
This is indeed what the market decided *T*-1.
By 1982 the ratio was 43.5%, *PRO* meaning that the market was valuing every dollar's worth of the average firm's assets at 43 cents.
From the history of capitalism we can take it *EXP*-1 as a sound bet that if it *EXP*-2 takes only 43 cents *PRO* to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way.
His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and 0 the capital assets 0 he bought *T*-1 on the cheap will soon be *-2 producing profits, *PRO* thus restoring the market's faith in them.
Hence the LBO craze.
But here is *T*-4 where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet *T*-1, and where society was maybe foolish *PRO*-3 to look the other way *T*-2.
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988.
Result: a landscape littered * with lemons, huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America.
The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980s.
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue *-1 shielding its eyes.
Mainstream economists and commentators, *PRO*-3 craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads *PRO*-2 to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy - outs, claimed 0 the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall.
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found *-1 *T*-2.
The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon *T*-1 was the topic figure of '80s capitalism, Michael Milken's $517 million *U* salary in one year.
Left - stream economists 0 I associate with *T*-1--fellows in the Union of Radical Political Economists, most particularly Robert Pollin of the economics faculty at the University of California at Riverside--were not hypnotized *-2 in the manner of their pliant colleagues.
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities.
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher, and now we have an extremely high - interest burden relative to cash flow.
The consequences of *PRO* building empires with sand are showing up.
In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2% or 3%, a Harvard study published * in April of this year (and discussed * in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18) found 0 the default rate on these junk bonds is 34%.
What *T*-1 is the consequence of a high - interest burden, high default rates and continued low profitability?
Corporations need liquidity, in the form of borrowed funds.
Without liquidity from the junk - bond market or cash flow from profits, they look to the government, which *T*-1 obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital - gains tax rate or bailouts.
The consequence can be inflation, brought * on as the effect of a desperate bid *PRO* to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash.
Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort: an assault on wages.
Mr. Fukuyama, *PRO*-2 peering through binoculars at the end of history, said in his essay that "the class issue has actually been successfully resolved *-1 in the West ...
the egalitarianism of modern America represents the essential achievement of the classless society envisioned * by Marx."
Mr. Fukuyama might want *PRO*-1 to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism.
From its peak in 1972 of $198.41 *U*, the average American weekly wage had fallen to $169.28 *U* in 1987--both figures being expressed *-1 in 1977 dollars.
In other words, after the glory boom of the Reagan years, wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16% as capitalists, *PRO*-1 helped *-2 by the government, turned down the screws or went offshore.
But there are signs *ICH*-2 now--the strikes by miners, Boeing workers, telephone workers, etc.--that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted *-1.
These are long - term Richter readings on American capitalism.
The whole structure is extremely shaky.
Governments have become sophisticated in *PRO*-3 handling moments of panic (a word 0 the London Times forbade my father to use *T*-1 when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929 *T*-2).
But sophistication has its limits.
The S&L bailout could cost $300 billion *U*, *PRO* computing interest on the government's loans.
These are real costs.
Under what weights will the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation totter *T*-1?
Capitalism may now be engineered *-3 *PRO*-4 to withstand sudden shocks, but there are fault lines--the crisis in profits, the assault on wages, the structural inequity of the system--that *T*-1 make fools of those who *T*-2 claim that the future is here and that history is over.
Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and LA Weekly.
The space shuttle Atlantis boosted the Galileo spacecraft on its way to Jupiter, *PRO*-1 giving a big lift as well to an ambitious U.S. program of space exploration.
*PRO*-1 Seven years late in the launching, $1 billion *U* over budget and a target of anti-nuclear protestors, Galileo has long been a symbol of trouble for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
But yesterday, as Atlantis rumbled into a patch of clear sky above Florida with storm clouds closing in on it, NASA sought *PRO*-1 to turn Galileo into a symbol of triumph.
"NASA did it right; that's the message," said *T*-1 J.R. Thompson, the agency's deputy administrator.
The $1.4 billion *U* robot spacecraft faces a six - year journey *PRO* to explore Jupiter and its 16 known moons.
If all goes well, it will parachute a probe into the dense Jovian atmosphere in July 1995 *PRO*-4 to pick up detailed data about gases that *T*-3 may be similar to the material from which the solar system was formed *-2 *T*-1 4.6 billion years ago.
Jupiter is so enormous--its mass is 318 times that of Earth--that its gravity may have trapped these primordial gases and never let them escape.
*PRO* Investigating Jupiter in detail may provide clues to what astronomer Tobias Owen calls *T*-2 *PRO*-3 the "cosmic paradox" of life: Jupiter and other bodies in the outer solar system are rich in elements such as hydrogen that *T*-1 are essential for life on Earth, but these planets are lifeless; Earth, on the other hand, has a diminished store of such material but is rich in life.
Some scientists have suggested that comets and asteroids may have brought enough of this kind of material *ICH*-1 from the outer solar system to Earth *PRO* to spawn life.
Beginning in December 1995, Galileo will begin a two - year tour of the Jovian moons.
In 1979, two Voyager spacecraft sent back stunning photos of Jovian moons Io and Europa that *T*-1 showed them to be among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system.
The photos showed active geysers on Io spewing sulfurous material 190 miles into its atmosphere and indicated that Europa may have an ocean hidden * under a thick sheet of ice.
Galileo's photos of Europa will be more than 1,000 times as sharp as Voyager's, according to Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist, and may show whether it actually has the only known ocean other than those on Earth.
Atlantis lifted Galileo from the launch pad at 12:54 p.m. EDT and released the craft from its cargo bay about six hours later.
"Galileo is on its way to another world in the hands of the best flight controllers in this world," Atlantis Commander Donald Williams said *T*-1.
"*PRO* Fly safely."
The five - member Atlantis crew will conduct several experiments, including *PRO* growing plants and processing polymeric materials in space, before their scheduled landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., Monday.
The Galileo project started in 1977, and a number of project veterans were on hand *PRO*-1 to watch the launch.
An ebullient Mr. Johnson, *PRO*-1 wearing a NASA baseball cap and carrying a camera and binoculars, called the launch "*PRO*-2 fantastic."
Benny Chin, manager of the Galileo probe, compared it to *PRO* watching a child leave home.
"I'm happy and sad," he said *T*-1.
Anti-nuclear activists took a less positive view.
*PRO*-1 Having argued that Galileo's plutonium power source could have released lethal doses of radiation if the shuttle exploded yesterday, they weren't quieted *-1 by yesterday's successful launch.
Galileo will skim past Earth in 1990 and 1992, *PRO*-1 collecting energy from the planet's gravitational field *PRO*-2 to gain momentum for its trip to Jupiter.
The protesters point out that Galileo also could crash to Earth then.
They said 0 they dropped plans *PRO* to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center after NASA beefed up its security.
One protest did get past NASA's guard, though; a computer virus caused anti-Galileo messages to flash onto some computer screens at NASA centers.
The successful launch continues a remarkable recovery in the U.S. space - science program.
An unmanned spacecraft, Magellan, already is heading to Venus and is due *-1 to begin *PRO*-2 mapping the planet next August.
Voyager 2 sent back spectacular photos of Neptune and its moon, Triton, this summer.
Next month, NASA plans *PRO*-2 to launch a satellite 0 *T*-1 to study cosmic rays dating from the birth of the universe.
In December, the shuttle Columbia will try *PRO*-2 to retrieve a satellite that *T*-1's been in orbit for nearly five years *PRO*-3 measuring the deleterious effects of space on materials and instruments.
Next March, the shuttle Discovery will launch the Hubble space telescope, a $1.5 billion *U* instrument designed * *PRO*-1 to see the faintest galaxies in the universe.
Not all of NASA's space - science work will be so auspicious, though.
Around Thanksgiving, the Solar Max satellite, which NASA repaired *T*-1 in orbit in 1984, will tumble back into the Earth's atmosphere.
NASA won't attempt a rescue; instead, it will try *PRO*-1 to predict whether any of the rubble will smash to the ground and where *?* *T*-2.
After *PRO*-1 failing *-2 to find a buyer for the Sears Tower in Chicago, Sears, Roebuck & Co. is negotiating with Boston pension fund adviser Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch Inc. *PRO*-1 to refinance the property for close to $850 million *U*, according to people close to the negotiations.
Under the proposed agreement involving the world's tallest building, Chicago - based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage.
At the end of the term of the convertible loan, Sears could still own half the building, and AEW could own the other half.
Neither side would comment.
The parties are currently negotiating over who *T*-2 would manage the building, which *T*-3 will be emptied *-1 of 6,000 employees from Sears' merchandise group, which *T*-4 is moving elsewhere.
The new manager will face the daunting task of *PRO* leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market.
Also, it *EXP*-4 has not yet been decided *-1 exactly how much of the mortgage AEW will be able *PRO*-3 to convert *T*-2 into equity.
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way 0 *PRO* to finance prestigious buildings of late *T*-1.
In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option *PRO* to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term.
During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return.
The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal.
Sears said 0 it would put the 110 - story tower on the block *ICH*-1 almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring.
But Japanese institutions shied away from *PRO*-1 bidding on the high - profile tower out of fear 0 their purchase of the property would trigger anti-Japanese sentiment.
Last summer, Sears appeared *-1 to have a deal with Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd.
But that deal fell through in September after it *EXP*-1 became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax reassessment, *PRO* raising property taxes, and making it *EXP*-2 difficult *PRO* to lease the building at competitive prices.
Real estate industry executives said 0 Sears' investment banker, Goldman, Sachs & Co., sought financing in Japan.
However, Japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity.
Sears then went back to AEW, the Boston pension adviser that *T*-1 had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring.
AEW has $3.5 billion *U* of real estate investments nationwide, according to a spokesman.
Program traders were buying and selling at full steam Monday, the first trading session after the stock market's 190.58 - point plunge Friday.
They accounted for a hefty 16% of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday, the fourth busiest session ever.
On Friday, 13% of volume was in computer - guided program trades.
In August, by contrast, program trading averaged 10.3% of daily Big Board turnover.
Program traders were publicly castigated *-1 following the 508 - point crash Oct. 19, 1987, and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from *PRO*-2 using this strategy for a while.
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988, they resumed.
Some observers thought that after Friday's sharp drop, the firms would rein in their program traders *PRO*-1 to avoid *PRO*-2 stoking more controversy.
But the statistics released * yesterday show 0 the firms did nothing of the sort.
One reason, they said 0 *?*, was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause.
Stock - index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves, if *PRO*-1 not actually causing them.
In it, traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock - index futures contracts *PRO*-1 to profit from fleeting price discrepancies.
Under the exchange's definitions, program trading also describes a number of other strategies that, in the opinion of some traders, *T*-1 don't cause big swings in the market.
The Big Board's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual.
Though it collects such data daily, its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends.
The September figures are due *-2 to be released *-1 this week.
The Big Board declined *PRO*-1 to name the Wall Street firms involved * in the activity Friday and Monday, or the type of strategies used *.
But traders on the exchange floor, who *T*-1 can observe the computer - guided trading activity on monitor screens, said 0 most of the top program - trading firms were active both days.
Through August, the top five program trading firms in volume were Morgan Stanley & Co., Kidder, Peabody & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading, one sign of what an issue it remains *T*-1 was that few executives would comment on the record.
Besides *PRO*-1 reciting the pardon for program trading contained * in the Brady Commission report, they said 0 stock - index arbitrage was actually needed *-2 Monday *PRO* to restore the markets' equilibrium.
On Friday, the stock - index futures market was unhinged *-1 from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract *T*-2--a "circuit breaker" procedure instituted * after the 1987 crash and implemented * for the first time.
Futures trading resumed a half - hour later, but the session ended shortly thereafter, *PRO* leaving the stock market set * up for more sell programs, traders said 0 *T*-1.
By Monday morning, they said 0 *?*, stock - index arbitrage sell programs helped *PRO*-1 re-establish the link between stocks and futures.
But stunning volatility was produced *-1 in the process.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged a breathtaking 63.52 points in the first 40 minutes of trading Monday as stock - index arbitrage sell programs kicked in.
At about 10:10 a.m. EDT, the market abruptly turned upward on stock - index arbitrage buy programs.
By day's end, the Dow industrials had rebounded 88.12 points, or nearly half of Friday's drop.
Resolution Funding Corp. plans *PRO*-1 to sell $4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds Wednesday in the agency's first sale of securities.
The new bonds will be dated *-1 *PRO*-2 Oct. 30 and mature Oct. 15, 2019.
Tenders for the bonds, available in minimum denominations of $1,000 *U*, must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EDT Wednesday at Federal Reserve banks.
Refcorp, created * by the thrift - overhaul law enacted * in August, will use the proceeds *PRO*-2 to merge *RNR*-1 or sell off *RNR*-1 ailing savings - and - loan institutions.
Congress authorized $50 billion *U* 0 *T*-1 to be borrowed *-2 *PPA*-3 *PRO* to pay for the thrift bailout.
Of that amount, $20 billion *U* *T*-2 has already been borrowed *-1 by the Treasury Department.
Unless *PRO* otherwise specified in a particular offer, the bonds won't be subject to redemption prior to maturity.
Interest payments on the bonds will be payable semiannually.
The bonds are subject to federal taxation *ICH*-1 in the U.S., including income taxes.
At the state and local level, the bonds are subject to surtaxes and estate, inheritance and gift taxes, but exempt from taxation as to principal and interest.
John V. Holmes, an investment - newsletter publisher, and three venture - capital firms 0 he organized *T*-2 were enjoined *-1 from *PRO*-1 violating the registration provisions of the securities laws governing investment companies.
As part of an agreement that *T*-1 settled charges brought * by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a receiver was also appointed *-2 for the three venture - capital firms.
Mr. Holmes was the subject of a page one profile in The Wall Street Journal in 1984, after the SEC questioned him about ties between him and companies 0 he touted *T*-1 in a newsletter.
In 1986, in another consent agreement with the SEC, Mr. Holmes was enjoined *-1 from *PRO*-1 violating the stock - registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws.
Without any admission or denial of guilt by Mr. Holmes, that agreement settled SEC charges that Mr. Holmes sold unregistered securities and misled investors.
In charges filed * last week in federal district court in Charlotte, N.C., the SEC alleged that Venture Capitalists Inc., Venture Finance Corp. and New Ventures Fund Inc., all of Charlotte, failed repeatedly *-1 to file proper documents.
The SEC also charged that Mr. Holmes acted as an officer or director of New Ventures, in violation of his previous consent agreement.
"Some companies were delinquent in filings and other actions, all of which *T*-1 cost money," Mr. Holmes said *T*-2.
Two of Mr. Holmes's business associates who *T*-2 worked for Venture Capitalists, Kimberly Ann Smith and Frederick Byrum, also consented *PRO* to being enjoined *-1 from violations of registration provisions of the securities laws.
Ms. Smith also agreed to a permanent injunction barring her from *PRO*-1 acting as an officer, director or investment adviser of any mutual fund, unit investment trust or face - amount certificate company.
Mr. Byrum and Ms. Smith couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
In *PRO*-1 consenting to the injunctions, none of the individuals or companies admitted or denied the allegations.
Enron Corp. said 0 a subsidiary and two United Kingdom firms are studying the feasibility of *PRO* constructing a 1,500 megawatt gas - fired power plant in northern England as an outgrowth of the government's privatization program.
Enron Power Corp., a unit of the Houston natural gas pipeline company, would design, construct and run the plant.
Gas 0 *T*-2 to fuel it would be piped *-1 from the North Sea.
A subsidiary of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries would buy electricity and steam from the proposed station.
Surplus power would be sold *-1 on the open market, Enron said 0 *T*-2.
Also participating in the study, Enron said 0 *?*, is *T*-2 the National Power division of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board.
Upon privatization, National Power will be responsible for 70% of the country's power generating business.
The Treasury plans *PRO*-1 to raise $700 million *U* in new cash with the sale Tuesday of about $10 billion *U* in two - year notes 0 *PRO* to redeem $9.29 billion *U* in maturing notes *T*-3.
The offering will be dated *-1 *PRO*-2 Oct. 31 and mature Oct. 31,
Tenders for the notes, available in minimum $5,000 *U* denominations, must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
Michael F. Klatman, director of corporate public relations at Data General Corp., was named *-1 to the new position of vice president, corporate communications, of this maker of data storage equipment.
Denis C. Smith was named *-1 to the new post of vice president of world - wide advanced materials operations for this chemicals concern.
Mr. Smith, 50 years old, was formerly responsible for advanced materials, which *T*-1 include plastic composites and alloys, in North America only.
Himont is 81% - owned by Montedison S.p . A. of Milan, Italy.
The average publicly offered commodity fund fell 4.2% in September, largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies, according to Norwood Securities.
The firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the 122 funds 0 it tracks *T*-1.
For the first nine months of the year, Norwood said 0 the average fund has lost 3.3%.
Many in Washington say 0 President Bush will have *-1 to raise taxes *PRO*-2 to pay for his war on drugs.
We have a better idea: *PRO* Dismantle HUD *PRO*-1 to pay for the war on drugs.
Housing and Urban Development's budget is $17 billion *U*.
From what we and the nation have been *-2 reading *T*-3, the money isn't being spent *-1 very well.
The single most important contribution 0 the government could make *T*-1 now *PRO*-2 to help the poor is *PRO* to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods.
If that takes money, *PRO* take it away from this discredited federal department.
But of course the Democrats pillorying HUD in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind.
Instead, they're scrambling *PRO*-1 to protect the very programs at the heart of the HUD scandal.
This month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms 0 *T*-1 to improve management at HUD.
No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing *PRO*-1 to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently.
Congress is unlikely *-1 to go even that far.
Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members.
They were appalled, for instance, that he wanted *PRO*-2 to target more of the $3 billion *U* Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low - income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that *T*-1 have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies.
These development grants mainly enrich developers who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to put up shopping centers and parking garages.
They also give those in Congress political credit for *PRO*-1 bringing home the pork, and so they are popular with such Members as Mary Rose Oakar.
Rep. Oakar, a Democrat from Cleveland, wants a $6.9 million *U* grant so Cleveland can build an 18 - story Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
She says 0 it'd create 600 jobs and bring Cleveland tourist revenue.
HUD says 0 the project doesn't qualify, and Mr. Kemp says that rock 'n' roll musicians and the music industry ought *PRO*-1 to put up the money.
At the hearing, Rep. Oakar started wailing about "phoney baloney regulations" that *T*-1 would stand between her and "housing for downtown Cleveland."
Rep. Chalmers Wylie, an Ohio Republican, rallied to the cause: "I think 0 the gentlelady is making an important statement.
The implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there's something wrong, I think 0 *T*-1 is most unfortunate."
We're sure 0 some theologian can explain the difference between what the Republican consultants have been doing *T*-1 with HUD and what these gentleladies and gentlemen want *PRO*-3 to do *T*-2 with HUD.
Our view is that given Congress's attitude toward HUD, the place probably is beyond reform.
For more than 50 years the federal government has tried various ways 0 *PRO* to provide housing for the poor and revive cities *T*-1.
In the process HUD has wasted untold billions, created slums and invited corruption.
Much of HUD's spending actually is disguised welfare for developers or the middle class.
That includes the CDBG funds and the Federal Housing Administration, which *T*-1 loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered *PRO*-1 to be $4 billion *U* in the hole.
*PRO* Selling the FHA's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers untold billions in future losses.
Some HUD money actually does trickle down to the poor, and *PRO* zeroing out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage *RNR*-1 and even own *RNR*-1 their units.
The rest ought *PRO*-1 to be used *-2 *PRO* to clean out drugs from the neighbhorhoods.
Rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones.
Even suburban Prince George's County, Md., reported last week 0 there have been a record 96 killings there this year, most of them drug - related.
Innocent bystanders often are the victims.
A man in a wheelchair was gunned *-1 down in the crossfire of a Miami drug battle.
A three - year - old Brooklyn boy was used *-1 as a shield by a drug dealer.
Decent life in the inner cities won't be restored *-1 unless the government reclaims the streets from the drug gangs.
Until then, the billions 0 HUD spends *T*-2 on inner - city housing simply is wasted *-1.
It *EXP*-3's still unclear whether Secretary Kemp wants *PRO*-1 to completely overhaul the engine room at HUD or just tighten a few screws here and there.
No doubt he believes 0 the place can be salvaged *-1.
*PRO*-1 Having seen the hypocrisy with which Congress has addressed the HUD scandals *T*-2, we disagree.
It's time 0 *PRO* to scrap the politically infested spending machine 0 HUD has become *T*-1 and channel the resources into the drug war *T*-2.
Congress sent President Bush an $18.4 billion *U* fiscal 1990 Treasury and Postal Service bill providing $5.5 billion *U* for the Internal Revenue Service and increasing the Customs Service's air - interdiction program nearly a third.
Final approval came on a simple voice vote in the Senate, and the swift passage contrasted with months of negotiations over the underlying bill which *T*-2 is laced with special - interest provisions for both members and the executive branch.
An estimated $33 million *U* was added *-1 for university and science grants, including $1.5 million *U* for Smith College.
And Southwest lawmakers were a driving force behind $54.6 million *U* for U.S. - Mexico border facilities, or more than double the administration's request.
More than $1.8 million *U* is allocated *-1 for pensions and expenses for former presidents, and the budget for the official residence of Vice President Quayle is more than doubled *-2, with $200,000 *U* designated *-3 for improvements to the property.
Even the Office of Management and Budget is remembered *-1 with an extra $1 million *U* 0 *T*-4 to help offset pay costs that other government departments are being asked *-3 *PRO*-5 to absorb *T*-2.
Within the IRS, nearly $1.95 billion *U* *ICH*-2 is provided *-3 for *PRO* processing tax returns, a 12% increase over fiscal 1989 and double what the government was spending *T*-4 five years ago.
Investigation and taxpayer service accounts would grow to $1.6 billion *U*, and Congress specifically added $7.4 million *U* for stepped up criminal investigations of money laundering related * to drug traffic.
The large increase in Customs Service air - interdiction funds is also intended *PRO*-1 to counter smuggling, and the annual appropriations level has more than quadrupled in five years.
The $196.7 million *U* provided * for fiscal 1990 anticipates the purchase of a Lockheed P - 3 surveillance aircraft and five Cessna Citation II jets.
Despite administration reservations, the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from Cessna's home state, Kansas.
Among legislative provisions attached * to the bill is *T*-1 a ban on any Treasury Department expenditure for enforcement of a 1986 tax provision intended *PRO* to counter discrimination in employee - benefit plans.
Small - business interests have lobbied against the so - called Section 89 tax rules.
Repeal is considered *-1 likely now, but the Treasury Department bill has been used *-2 as a vehicle *PRO* to raise the profile of the issue and block any action in the interim.
Less noticed is *T*-2 a bit of legislative legerdemain by Houston Republicans on behalf of HEI Corp. of Texas 0 *PRO* to retroactively "move" a Missouri hospital from one county to the next *PRO*-1 to justify higher Medicare reimbursements *T*-3.
The provision seeks *PRO*-1 to wipe out an estimated $1.4 million *U* in claims made * by the Health Care Finance Administration against HEI, which *T*-1988 owned the hospital in Sullivan, Mo., during most of the four - year period--1983 - 1987--covered * in the amendment.
In a separate development, a private meeting *ICH*-1 is scheduled *-2 this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss .) and Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark .) in an effort *PRO* to end a dispute which for two weeks *T*-3 has delayed action on an estimated $44 billion *U* agriculture bill.
A House - Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill, but final settlement has been stalled *-5 because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas - based program 0 *T*-1 to provide technical information to farmers seeking *PRO* to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
The program's nonprofit sponsors received $900,000 *U* in fiscal 1989 through an Extension Service grant, but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in *PRO* insisting that the program be cut *-1 in 1990.
The 79 - year - old Mississippian takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement *PRO* to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork - barrel politics, he is believed *-1 to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border.
Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the San Francisco Bay area for months 0 *T*-2 to come.
But rail, air and ocean - shipping links to the area escaped Tuesday's earthquake with only minor damage, and many are expected *-1 to be operating normally today, government and corporate transport officials said 0 *T*-2.
Air traffic at San Francisco International Airport was running about 50% of normal yesterday afternoon, but airport officals said 0 they expect a return to full operations by Saturday.
The major gateway to Asia and one of the nation's 10 busiest airports was closed *-1 to all but emergency traffic from the time 0 the quake hit Tuesday afternoon *T*-2, until 6 a.m. PDT yesterday when controllers returned to the tower *T*-3.
*PRO* Getting to and from the airport in coming weeks may be the problem, however.
"People's ability *PRO* to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted *-1," said *T*-2 a spokesman for the American Automobile Association.
Tom Schumacher, executive vice president and general manager of the California Trucking Association in Sacremento, said 0 his organization urged trucking firms *PRO*-3 to halt all deliveries into the Bay area *ICH*-2 yesterday, except for emergency - medical supplies.
"Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume Thursday," he said *T*-1.
"Right now most of the roads into the Bay area are closed *-1, but the list of closings changes about every 20 minutes.
This {Wednesday} morning the San Mateo bridge was open and now we are informed *-1 that it is closed," Mr. Schumacher said *T*-2.
United Parcel Service, Greenwich, Conn., said 0 its operations in the San Francisco area have been reduced *-1 to 40% of normal.
A UPS spokesman said that although none of the company's terminals, trucks or airplanes were damaged *-1 in the quake, road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages.
The spokesman noted four - hour to five - hour traffic delays on the San Mateo bridge, for example.
In addition, power failures prevented its package - sorting facilities from *PRO*-1 operating, *PRO* causing delays.
But freight railroads reported that damage to their facilities was relatively minor, with Santa Fe Pacific Corp.'s rail unit the least affected by the quake.
Santa Fe stopped freight trains Tuesday night while its officials inspected track but resumed service at 10:45 p.m. when they found no damage *T*-1.
Union Pacific Corp.'s rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its Oakland yard, its track, bridges and structures were unharmed.
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused * by employees unable *PRO* to get to work.
Southern Pacific Transportation Co., the hardest hit of the three railroads in the Bay area, said 0 service on its north - south coastline, which *T*-3 is used *-2 by an Amtrak train between Los Angeles and Seattle, was suspended *-1 temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake.
But service on the line is expected *-1 to resume by noon today.
"We had no serious damage on the railroad," said *T*-1 a Southern Pacific spokesman.
"We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact 0 businesses are shut *-1 down."
Amtrak said 0 it suspended train service into its Oakland station, which *T*-1 sustained "heavy structural damage" during the quake.
The passenger railroad said 0 it terminated some runs in Sacramento, *PRO*-1 relying on buses *PRO*-2 to ferry passengers to the Bay area.
Amtrak said 0 it planned *PRO*-1 to resume some train operations to Oakland late yesterday.
Rail - transit operations suffered little damage, according to Albert Engelken, deputy executive director of the American Public Transit Association in Washington.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit "withstood the earthquake perfectly," said 0 *T*-1 Mr. Engelken, *PRO*-2 adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of 45 trains during the day *PRO*-3 to provide an alternative for highway travelers.
"The highway system is screwed *-1 up" by the earthquake, Mr. Engelken said 0 *T*-2.
"The transit system is how people are going *-1 to be getting around *T*-2."
He added that San Francisco's trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels.
Although air - traffic delays in San Francisco were significant yesterday, they didn't appear *-1 to spread to other airports.
The earthquake shattered windows at San Francisco International's air - traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers, three of whom *T*-1 suffered minor injuries.
Terminals at San Francisco International also were damaged *-1, but the tower itself was intact.
Tuesday night, thousands were diverted *-1 to other airports and had *-1 to wait a day *PRO*-2 to resume travel.
Runways at San Francisco weren't damaged *-2, but traffic was being limited *-1 yesterday to 27 arrivals and 27 departures an hour--down from 33 to 45 an hour normally--mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows, an FAA spokeswoman said 0 *T*-3.
While the airport was closed, flights were diverted *-2 to airports in Sacramento and Stockton, Calif.; Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; and Los Angeles.
United Airlines, the largest carrier at San Francisco, was operating only 50% of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal, which in turn *T*-1 was causing delays for travelers headed to the Bay area.
A United spokesman said 0 14 of its 21 gates were unusable, mainly because of water damage caused * when a sprinkler system was triggered *-1 by the tremors *T*-2.
The United spokesman said 0 none of its people were injured *-1 at the airport; in fact, as the airport was being evacuated *-2 Tuesday night, two babies were born *-3.
Yesterday, the United ticket counter was active, with people trying *PRO*-1 to get flights out, but the airline said 0 demand for seats into the city also was active, with people trying *PRO*-2 to get there *PRO*-2 to help family and friends.
The airports in San Jose and Oakland were both fully operational by noon yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration said 0 *T*-1.
In terms of diversions, Denver's Stapleton International may have experienced the most far - flung: A United flight from Japan was rerouted *-1 there.
"I think 0 that's the first nonstop commercial passenger flight from Japan 0 *T*-3 to land here," an airport spokesman said *T*-2.
A Japan Air Lines spokesman said 0 its flights into *RNR*-2 and out of *RNR*-2 San Francisco weren't affected *-1, but *PRO* getting information about its operations was difficult.
Its telecommunications headquarters in Burlingame, Calif., had been knocked *-1 out since the quake.
"We're in the dark," he said *T*-1.
A grand jury here indicted Norton Co.'s former director of advanced - ceramics research, *PRO*-1 charging him with interstate transportation of stolen property.
Norton and General Electric Co. last month filed a lawsuit against the former research manager, Chien - Min Sung, *PRO*-1 charging him with *PRO*-2 stealing trade secrets.
Mr. Sung formerly worked at General Electric in research on synthetic diamonds.
The criminal charges brought * against him involved GE technology, according the court documents.
If *PRO*-1 convicted *-2, he could be imprisoned *-1 for up to 10 years and fined *-1 $250,000 *U*.
Mr. Sung couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
He earlier denied the allegations against him in the lawsuit by Norton and GE.
Norton makes sandpaper and other abrasives, diamond tools, specialty plastics and ceramics.
Addington Resources Inc. said 0 it called for redemption on Nov. 21 its $25.8 million *U* outstanding of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2013.
The debentures were issued *-1 in the face amount of $46 million *U* on July 11, 1988, the Ashland, Ky., coal mining, water transportation and construction company said 0 *T*-2.
The company said 0 the redemption is permitted *-1 because the price of Addington's stock has equaled or exceeded $19.60 *U* for 20 consecutive trading days, a condition set * in the terms of the debentures.
Debenture holders are expected *-1 to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received * in a conversion would exceed the $1,103.11 *U* redemption price.
The government moved aggressively *PRO*-3 to open the spigots of federal aid for victims of the California earthquake, but its reservoir of emergency funds must be replenished *-1 soon if the aid is *-2 to continue.
President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties.
The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing, grants and low - cost loans 0 *T*-1 to cover uninsured property losses.
In addition, an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved *PRO*-1 to provide specialized assistance.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared *PRO*-1 to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left *PRO* *PRO*-3 homeless, the Agriculture Department was set *PRO*-2 to divert food from the school - lunch program to earthquake victims, and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for *PRO* directing traffic.
But the pool of federal emergency - relief funds already is running *PRO*-1 low because of the heavy costs of *PRO* cleaning up Hurricane Hugo, and Congress will be under pressure *PRO* to allocate more money quickly.
In Hugo's wake, Congress allocated $1.1 billion *U* in relief funds, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 0 $273 million *U* of that money remains and could be diverted *-1 for quick expenditures related to the earthquake.
Now, though, enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief.
"That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the emergencies that *T*-1 are now facing us, and we will have *-2 to consider appropriate requests for follow - on funding," Mr. Fitzwater said *T*-3.
The federal government isn't even attempting yet *PRO*-1 to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it *T*-2.
But Mr. Fitzwater said, "There will be, I think quite obviously 0 *?*, a very large amount of money required * from all levels of government."
In Congress, lawmakers already are looking for ways 0 *PRO* to add relief funds *T*-1.
Money could be added *-1 to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which *T*-2 coordinates federal disaster relief.
More likely, relief funds could be added *-1 to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is *-2 to begin *-4 considering *T*-3 next week.
But it isn't just Washington's relief dollars that *T*-3 are spread *-1 thin; its relief manpower also is stretched *-2.
FEMA still has special disaster centers *ICH*-2 open 0 *T*-1 to handle the aftermath of Hugo, and spokesman Russell Clanahan acknowledged that "we're pretty thin."
Mr. Clanahan says 0 FEMA now possibly may have the heaviest caseload in its history.
*PRO* To further complicate relief efforts, the privately funded American Red Cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big Hugo operation.
"It's been a bad month money-wise and every other way," said *T*-1 Sally Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross.
"It just makes it a little rough when you have *-1 to worry about the budget *T*-2."
The Red Cross has opened 30 shelters in the Bay area, *PRO*-1 serving 5,000 people.
Twenty - five trucks capable of *PRO* cooking food were dispatched *-1 from other states.
All the precise types of federal aid that *T*-3 will be sent *-2 to California won't be determined *-1 until state officials make specific requests to FEMA, agency officials said 0 *T*-4.
And in the confusion after the earthquake, "the information flow is a little slow *PRO*-2 coming in from the affected area," said 0 *T*-1 Carl Suchocki, a FEMA spokesman.
Still, some aid is moving westward from Washington almost immediately.
HUD officials said 0 they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that *T*-1 are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected *-2 *PRO* to ensure 0 they are sound.
Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made *-1 available, officials said 0 *?*, and some housing and community - development funds may be shifted *-2 from other programs or made *-2 available for emergency use.
Another federal agency not normally associated * with disaster relief--the Internal Revenue Service--moved quickly as well.
The IRS said 0 it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable *PRO* to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake's devastation.
The agency plans *PRO*-1 to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days.
And the Treasury said 0 residents of the San Francisco area will be able *PRO*-1 to cash in savings bonds even if they haven't held them for the minimum six - month period.
One advantage that federal officials have *T*-3 in *PRO*-1 handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area, facilities that *T*-2 provide a ready base of supplies and workers.
Even before the full extent of the devastation was known *-1, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare *PRO*-2 to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance.
By yesterday afternoon, Air Force transport planes began *-1 moving additional rescue and medical supplies, physicians, communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California.
A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials *PRO*-1 to survey the damage.
And the Pentagon said 0 dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert "*PRO*-1 awaiting orders *PRO* to move emergency supplies."
Two Air Force facilities near Sacramento, and Travis Air Force Base, 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, were designated *-1 *PRO*-2 to serve as medical - airlift centers.
Some victims also were treated *-1 at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco and at the Naval Hospital in Oakland.
In addition, 20 military police from the Presidio, a military base in San Francisco, are assisting with traffic control, and a Navy ship was moved *-1 from a naval station at Treasure Island near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco *PRO* to help *PRO*-2 fight fires.
*PRO*-1 To help residents in Northern California rebuild, FEMA intends *PRO*-1 to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies, said 0 *T*-2 Robert Volland, chief of the agency's individual assistance division.
At these offices, earthquake victims will be helped *-1 in *PRO*-1 filling out a one - page form that they will need *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to qualify for such federal assistance as home - improvement loans and to repair houses.
And federal officials are promising *PRO*-1 to move rapidly with federal highway aid *PRO*-1 to rebuild the area's severely damaged road system.
The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program 0 *T*-1 to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged * by natural disasters.
The account currently has $220 million *U*.
And though federal law dictates that only $100 million *U* *ICH*-3 can be disbursed *-1 from that fund in any one state per disaster, administration officials expect Congress to move in *PRO*-2 to authorize *PRO* spending more now in California.
*PRO*-2 To get that money, states must go through an elaborate approval process, but officials expect red tape to be cut *-1 this time.
Keith Mulrooney, special assistant to Federal Highway Administrator Thomas Larson, also said that after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake in Southern California, the state set tougher standards for bridges, and with federal aid, began a program 0 *T*-1 to retrofit highways and bridges for earthquake hazards.
The first phase of the program has been completed *-1, but two other phases are continuing.
The two major structures that *T*-881 failed Tuesday night *ICH*-1, he said 0 *?*, were both built *-2 well before the 1971 earthquake--the San Francisco Bay Bridge, completed * in the 1930s, and the section of I - 880, built * in the 1950s.
The I - 880 section had completed the first phase of the retrofitting.

The frenetic stock and bond markets cooled off, but the dollar slumped.
Stocks rose slightly as trading activity slowed from the frenzied pace earlier this week.
Prices of long - term Treasury bonds hovered in a narrow band most of the day, *PRO*-1 finishing *PRO*-2 little changed despite the dollar's weakness and fears about a wave of government borrowing coming soon.

But many investors remain wary about stocks, partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk - bond market that *T*-2 would make it *EXP*-1 more difficult *PRO* to finance corporate takeovers.
"I'm surprised 0 we didn't see more volatility" in stocks, said 0 *T*-1 Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.
"I think 0 the problems in the junk - bond area are just beginning, and this will be very unsettling for companies that *T*-1 have issued junk bonds.
In a bull market, credit does not matter," Mr. DeVoe added *T*-1.
"But when it does matter *T*-2, then it's the only thing that *T*-1 matters."
However, many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market's plunge as "a great buying opportunity," said 0 *T*-1 Charles I. Clough, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
"Things are beginning *-1 to settle down.
The markets are returning to normalcy."
Oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in Northern California would disrupt production.
But prices later reversed course, *PRO*-1 finishing *PRO*-2 slightly lower, as investors concluded that any cuts wouldn't be large and that foreign oil producers would quickly pick up the slack.

The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door - to - door nationwide polls conducted * for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.
The two surveys, which *T*-2 asked different questions, were conducted *-1 *PRO* using national random probability samples.
The poll conducted * by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30, 1989.
The poll conducted * by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15, 1989.
Responses were weighted *-1 on the basis of age and gender *PRO*-1 to conform with U.S. Census data.
For each poll, the odds *ICH*-2 are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought *PRO*-1 to survey every household in the U.S. *PRO*-3 using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.
The margin of error for subgroups--for example, married women with children at home--would be larger.
In addition, in any survey, there is always the chance that other factors such as question wording could introduce errors into the findings.
This temblor - prone city dispatched inspectors, firefighters and other earthquake - trained personnel *PRO*-1 to aid San Francisco.
But a secondary agenda among officials in the City of Angels was *PRO* to learn about the disaster - contingency plans that *T*-1 work and those that *T*-2 don't *?*.
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley used the opportunity *PRO*-2 to push the City Council harder *PRO*-1 to pass a measure establishing a loss - recovery reserve of $100 million *U*.
The amount would help Los Angeles cope in the first few weeks after its own anticipated quake, while *PRO*-1 waiting for federal assistance to arrive.
After San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos spoke on television of the need for building inspectors to check the soundness of buildings, Los Angeles dispatched 32 inspectors 0 *T*-1 to help.
And the county of Los Angeles placed its firefighters and sheriffs on alert, *PRO*-3 ready *PRO*-2 to send in reinforcements, and alerted San Francisco that the city has 1,000 hospital beds at its disposal.
Two Los Angeles radio stations initiated Red Cross donation campaigns, and one Los Angeles bank manager forked over $150,000 *U* of his own money for relief purposes, the Red Cross said 0 *T*-1.
The Los Angeles Red Cross sent 2,480 cots, 500 blankets, and 300 pints of Type - O blood.
It is also pulling 20 people *ICH*-1 out of Puerto Rico, who *T*-2 were helping Huricane Hugo victims, and sending them to San Francisco instead.
Without federal subsidies to developers of beach houses, the economic and structural damage by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina would have been much less, as *PRO* highlighted *-1 by your Oct. 3 editorial "*PRO* Subsidizing Disaster."
Congress should stop *-1 throwing tax dollars out to sea by *PRO*-1 subsidizing the development of beach communities on ecologically fragile coastal barrier islands, such as the hard - hit Isle of Palms near Charleston.
As you mentioned, subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed *-1 in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System.
The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by *PRO*-1 enacting "The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989."
This bill simply says that if you want *PRO*-1 to develop property on a barrier island you have *-2 to do so without taxpayer support.
Private - property rights would be upheld *-1 because the legislation would not ban coastal development.
However, home builders would have *-1 to bear the full costs of such beach - house construction.
A Taxpayers Union study concluded 0 the bill would save taxpayers up to $9.3 billion *U* in barrier - island subsidies over 20 years.
Already, the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $800 million *U*.

San Francisco area officials gave the media high marks for *PRO*-1 helping people find shelter and obtain emergency information after Tuesday's catastrophic earthquake.
"The press has been doing an excellent job.
They are telling people what roads *T*-1 are closed and *PRO* just keeping the public *PRO*-4 informed has helped *PRO*-2 to keep the panic down," said *T*-3 James Ball, a station supervisor at Daly City Police Department.
Mr. Ball noted that television stations featured people holding up phone books, *PRO*-1 explaining where *PRO* to call for help *T*-2.
Radio stations provided an emergency number for people who *T*-1 smelled gas but didn't know how *PRO* to turn off their gas supply *T*-2.
Kim Schwartz, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Los Angeles, said 0 television and radio stations in San Francisco played a "very positive role" by *PRO*-2 providing the address of 28 shelters of the Red Cross and by *PRO*-2 giving out the Red Cross number for contributions 0 *T*-1 to help earthquake victims (1-800-453-9000).
The San Francisco Examiner issued a special edition *ICH*-1 around noon yesterday that *T*-3 was filled *-2 entirely with earthquake news and information.
The Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were able *PRO*-2 to publish despite Tuesday's quake, which *T*-1 occurred close to deadline for many newspapers.
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar (D., Ohio) at last week's hearings on irregularities in programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development:
I don't want *PRO*-1 to feel guilty *PRO*-2 representing my constituents.
And if I think that some people {on HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's} staff are off base in terms in which they're evaluating certain things affecting my hometown *T*-1, I have *-2 to tell you something--I'm not going *-3 to take it.
I think that I'm elected *-2 *PRO*-3 to represent the people that *T*-1 sent me here.
And one of our charges is *PRO* to be an ombudsman for our area.
And if we're not ombudsman for our area, we ought *PRO*-2 to be thrown *-1 out of office.
On the other hand, if we're asking for something unreasonable or unethical and so on, then that's a whole different story.
But if I feel that there are situations where I'm trying *PRO*-1 to get housing for our area--whatever it happens *-3 to be *T*-2--*T*-6 and I have *-4 to feel that I can't even ask a question, I've got *-5 to tell you, 0 I think 0 that's outrageous . .
I think 0 these regulations that *T*-1 would prohibit well - operated programs in areas across this country would be wrong 0 *PRO* to change *T*-2....
I don't want *PRO*-1 to see some guidelines change that *T*-2's going *-3 to inhibit my city's opportunity *PRO* to use its money.
Sterling Software Inc. said 0 it lost its bid *PRO* to supply software services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif.
Sterling, which *T*-1 estimated the value of the contract at $150 million *U*, said 0 NASA selected another bidder for final negotiations.
In 1988, Dallas - based Sterling protested a similar decision by NASA involving the same contract, *PRO*-1 claiming 0 it had submitted the lowest bid.
As a result, last March the General Services Administration board of contract appeals directed NASA *PRO*-1 to reopen negotiations on the contract.
Sterling said 0 it had requested a briefing by NASA but had not decided whether *PRO*-1 to protest the agency's latest decision.

Part of a Series}
Betty Lombardi is a mild - mannered homemaker and grandmother in rural Hunterdon County, N.J.
But *PRO* put her behind a shopping cart and she turns ruthless.
If Colgate toothpaste offers a tempting money - saving coupon, she'll cross Crest off her shopping list without a second thought.
*PRO* Never mind that her husband prefers Crest.
Some weeks when her supermarket runs a double - coupon promotion *T*-1, she boasts that she shaves $22 *U* off her bill.
Money isn't the only thing that *T*-1 makes her dump once favorite brands.
After she heard about the artery - clogging hazards of tropical oils in many cookies, she dropped Pepperidge Farm and started *-1 buying brands free of such oils.
"I always thought 0 Pepperidge Farm was tasty and high quality," Mrs. Lombardi says *T*-1.
"But I don't want any of that oil for my grandkids."
(Pepperidge Farm says 0 it can't tell exactly how many customers it has lost *T*-1, but it hopes *PRO*-2 to remove the objectionable tropical oil from all its products by year end.)
Clearly, people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits.
She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who *T*-1 puts bargain prices, nutritional and environmental concerns, and other priorities ahead of old - fashioned brand loyalty.
While brand loyalty is far from dead, marketing experts say 0 it has eroded during the 1980s.
Marketers themselves are partly to blame: They've increased spending for coupons and other short - term promotions at the expense of image - building advertising.
What *T*-1's more, a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands, many of which *T*-2 are virtually carbon copies of one other.
"Marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use" of promotions, contends 0 *T*-1 Joe Plummer, an executive vice president at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ad agency.
"Without some real product improvements, it *EXP*-1's going *-2 to be difficult *PRO* to win that loyalty back."
The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products 0 they use *T*-1.
For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates asked some 2,000 consumers, including Mrs. Lombardi, whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty.
More than half the users of 17 of the 25 products included * in the survey said 0 they're brand switchers.
Overall, 12% of consumers aren't brand loyal for any of the 25 product categories.
About 47% are loyal for one to five of the products.
Only 2% are brand loyal in 16 to 20 of the categories, and no one is loyal for more than 20 types of products.
For such products as canned vegetables and athletic shoes, devotion to a single brand was quite low, with fewer than 30% saying 0 they usually buy the same brand.
Only for cigarettes, mayonnaise and toothpaste did more than 60% of users say 0 they typically stick with the same brand.
People tend *-2 to be most loyal to brands that *T*-1 have distinctive flavors, such as cigarettes and ketchup.
Kathie Huff, a respondent in the Journal survey from Spokane, Wash., says 0 her husband is adamant about *PRO*-1 eating only Hunt's ketchup.
He simply can't stomach the taste of Heinz, she says 0 *T*-1.
The 31 - year - old homemaker adds, "The only other thing 0 I'm really loyal to *T*-1 is my Virginia Slims cigarettes.
Coke and Pepsi are all the same to me, and I usually buy whichever brand of coffee *T*-1 happens *-2 to be on sale."
Brand imagery plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes, perfume and beer.
People often stay with a particular brand because they want *PRO*-3 to be associated *-1 with the image 0 its advertising conveys *T*-2, whether that's macho Marlboro cigarettes or Cher's Uninhibited perfume.
Loyalty lags most for utilitarian products like trash bags and batteries.
Only 23% of trash - bag users in the Journal survey usually buy the same brand, and just 29% of battery buyers stick to one brand.
Underwear scored a middling 36% in brand loyalty, but consumer researchers say 0 that's actually quite high for such a mundane product.
"In the past, you just wore Fruit of the Loom and didn't care," says *T*-1 Peter Kim, U.S. director of consumer behavior research for the J. Walter Thompson ad agency.
"The high score reflects the attempts *PRO* to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women."
He believes 0 there's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty.
What loyalty 0 there is *T*-3 to gas brands, he believes 0 *?*, is a matter of *PRO* stopping at the most conveniently located service stations.
Brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the Journal survey.
Nearly one - fourth of participants age 60 and older claim brand loyalty for more than 10 of the 25 products in the survey; only 9% of those age 18 to 29 have such strong allegiance.
Higher - income people also tend *-1 to be more brand loyal these days, the Journal survey and other research studies indicate 0 *T*-2.
Marketers speculate that more affluent people tend *-3 to lead more pressured lives and don't have time 0 *PRO* to research the products 0 they buy *T*-1 for the highest quality and most reasonable price *T*-2.
An established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality, if not always the best value for the money.
It's sort of loyalty by default.
Meanwhile, "the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal," says 0 *T*-1 Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the ad agency FCB / Leber Katz Partners.
"They're buying whatever *T*-1's cheaper."
The biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game: How those hotly pursued but highly unpredictable baby boomers will behave *T*-1 as they move into middle age.
They grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less allegiance so far.
But now that they're settling down and raising families, might they also show more stability in their brand choices?
Mr. Kim of J. Walter Thompson doesn't think so.
He believes 0 baby boomers will continue *-1 to be selective in their brand loyalties.
"Earlier generations were brand loyal across categories," he says *?*, "but boomers tend *-1 to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water, but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances."
While *PRO*-1 not as brand loyal as in the past, consumers today don't buy products capriciously, either.
Rather, they tend *-1 to have a set of two or three favorites.
Sometimes, they'll choose Ragu spaghetti sauce; other times, it will be Prego.
Advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands.
If a more absorbent Pampers hits the market, you can be sure 0 a new and improved Huggies won't be far behind.
The BBDO Worldwide ad agency studied "brand parity" and found that consumers believe 0 all brands are about the same in a number of categories, particularly credit cards, paper towels, dry soups and snack chips.
"When there's a clutter of brands *T*-5, consumers simplify the complexity by *PRO*-6 telling themselves, ` All brands are the same so what difference does it *EXP*-2 make *T*-1 which I buy *T*-3,"' says *T*-4 Karen Olshan, a senior vice president at BBDO.
"Too often, advertising imagery hasn't done a good job of *PRO*-1 forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer."
But given such strong brand disloyalty, some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising.
A small but growing number of companies are also trying *PRO*-1 to instill more fervent brand loyalty through such personalized direct - marketing ploys as catalogs, magazines and membership clubs for brand users.
While discount promotions are essential for most brands, some companies concede 0 they went overboard in *PRO*-1 shifting money from advertising to coupons, refunds and other sales incentives.
Some people argue that strong brands can afford *PRO*-1 to stop *-2 advertising for a time because of the residual impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent * on advertising through the years.
But most companies are too afraid *PRO*-1 to take that chance.
And perhaps with good reason.
Says *ICH*-2 Clayt Wilhite, president of the D'Arcy Masius ad agency's U.S. division, "Every time 0 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement *T*-1, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly--even for a powerful brand like Budweiser."
*PRO* Consider, for example, what *T*-1 happened to Maxwell House coffee.
The Kraft General Foods brand stopped *-1 advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business.
But since *PRO*-1 returning to advertising, Maxwell House has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival Folgers.
"Now, Philip Morris {Kraft General Foods' parent company} is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for Maxwell House," says *T*-1 Dick Mayer, president of the General Foods USA division.
"Even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee, we need advertising *PRO*-1 to maintain and strengthen it."
Campbell Soup Co., for one, has concluded that it *EXP*-3 makes good sense *PRO* to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who *T*-4 buy competitive brands.
"The probability of *PRO* converting a non-user to your brand is about three in 1,000," says *T*-1 Tony Adams, the company's vice president for marketing research.
"The best odds are with your core franchise.
Our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week, and we'd like *PRO*-1 to increase that."
So Campbell is talking to its "brand enthusiasts," *PRO*-1 probing their psychological attachment to its soup.
In one consumer focus group, a fan declared that, "Campbell's soup is like *PRO* getting a hug from a friend."
That helped persuade the company *PRO*-1 to introduce a new advertising slogan: "A warm hug from Campbell's."
Diamond - Star Motors Corp., a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said 0 it will begin *-1 shipping Mitsubishi Eclipse cars to Japan next week, *PRO*-1 emulating other Japanese auto ventures shipping U.S. - built vehicles back to Japan.
Diamond - Star said 0 it will export about 1,500 Eclipse cars to Japan by year's end.
Honda Motor Co., the first Japanese auto maker 0 *T*-1 to ship cars to Japan from the U.S., is now exporting more than 5,000 Accord Coupes a year from its Marysville, Ohio, factory.
Digital Equipment Corp. is planning a big coming - out party on Tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers.
But an uninvited guest is expected *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to crash the party.
On the morning of the long - planned announcement, International Business Machines Corp. is *-1 to introduce its own new mainframe.
"Their attitude is, ` You want *PRO*-1 to talk mainframes, we'll talk mainframes,"' says *T*-2 one computer industry executive.
"They're deliberately trying *PRO*-1 to steal our thunder," a Digital executive complains *T*-2.
"Maybe we should take it as a compliment."
Digital's target is the $40 billion *U* market for mainframe computers, the closet - sized number - crunchers that nearly every big company needs *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to run its business.
IBM, based * in Armonk, N.Y., has dominated the market for decades.
That doesn't scare Digital, which *T*-1 has grown *PRO*-2 to be the world's second - largest computer maker by *PRO*-2 poaching customers of IBM's mid-range machines.
Digital, based * in Maynard, Mass., hopes *PRO*-1 to stage a repeat performance in mainframes, and it has spent almost $1 billion *U* *PRO*-2 developing the new technology.
A spoiler, nimble Tandem Computers Inc. in Cupertino, Calif., jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry.
IBM appears *-3 more worried about Digital, which *T*-1 has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line, dubbed *PRO* *PRO*-2 the VAX 9000.
"It's going *-2 to be nuclear war," says *T*-1 Thomas Willmott, a consultant with Aberdeen Group Inc.
The surge in competition is expected *-1 to stir new life into the huge mainframe market, where growth has slowed to single digits in recent years *T*-2.
IBM's traditional mainframe rivals, including Unisys Corp., Control Data Corp. and NCR Corp., have struggled recently.
Digital is promising a new approach.
Robert M. Glorioso, Digital's vice president for high performance systems, says 0 Digital's mainframe is designed *-1 not as a central computer around which everything revolves *T*-2, but as part of a decentralized network weaving together hundreds of workstations, personal computers, printers and other devices.
And unlike IBM's water - cooled mainframes, it doesn't need any plumbing.
The challengers will have a big price advantage.
Digital is expected *-1 to tag its new line from about $1.24 million *U* to $4.4 million *U* and up, *PRO* depending on configuration.
That's about half the price of comparably equipped IBM mainframes.
Tandem's pricing is just as aggressive.
The heightened competition will hit IBM at a difficult time.
The computer giant's current mainframe line, which *T*-1 has sold well and has huge profit margins, is starting *-2 to show its age.
The new 3090s due next week will boost performance by only about 8% to 10% *U*.
And IBM isn't expected *-1 to deliver a new generation of mainframes until 1991.
Still, no one expects IBM's rivals to deliver a knockout.
IBM has a near - monopoly on mainframes, with an estimated 70% share of the market.
IBM is five times the size of Digital--and 40 times the size of Tandem--and wields enormous market power.
It counts among its customers a majority of the world's largest corporations, which *T*-1 entrust their most critical business information to IBM computers.
"We're not going *-1 to walk in and replace a company's corporate accounting system if it's already running on an IBM mainframe," concedes *T*-2 Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president.
He says 0 Digital will target faster - growing market segments such as on - line transaction processing, which *T*-1 includes retail - sales tracking, airline reservations and bank - teller networks.
Tandem, which *T*-1 already specializes in on - line transaction processing, is a potent competitor in that market.
A key marketing target for Digital will be the large number of big customers who *T*-1 already own both Digital and IBM systems.
One such company is Bankers Trust Co.
Stanley Rose, a vice president, technological and strategic planning at Bankers Trust, says that despite Digital's low prices, "we aren't about *-1 to unplug our IBM mainframes for a DEC machine.
The software conversion costs would dwarf any savings."
But Mr. Rose is still looking seriously at the 9000.
Bankers Trust uses Digital's VAX *PRO*-2 to run its huge money - transfer and capital markets accounts, *PRO*-2 juggling hundreds of billions of dollars each day, he says 0 *T*-3.
As that system grows, larger computers may be needed *-1.
"In the past, customers had *-1 to go to IBM when they outgrew the VAX *T*-2.
Now they don't have *-1 to *?*," he says *T*-2.
"That's going *-1 to cost IBM revenue."
Analysts say 0 Digital can expect this pent - up demand for the new VAX to fuel strong sales next year.
Barry F. Willman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., estimates 0 the 9000 could boost sales by more than $1 billion *U* in the fiscal year beginning in July.
He bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of Digital's largest customers.
Although Digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week, it isn't expected *-1 to begin *PRO*-2 shipping in volume until next year.
The first model available will be the 210, which *T*-1 is likely *-2 to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested * in the optional super-charger, or vector processor, says 0 *T*-3 Terry Shannon of International Data Corp., a market research concern.
Four more models, aimed * squarely at IBM's commercial customers, are expected *-1 to begin *PRO*-2 shipping in late June.
Most analysts don't expect the new mainframes to begin *-2 contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter, which *T*-1 begins next July 1.
Digital's new line has been a long time *PRO*-1 coming.
The company has long struggled *PRO*-1 to deliver a strong mainframe - class product, and made a costly decision *ICH*-2 in 1988 *PRO* to halt development of an interim product meant *PRO* to stem the revenue losses at the high end.
Digital's failure *PRO* to deliver a true mainframe - class machine before now may have cost the company as much as $1 billion *U* in revenue in fiscal 1989, Mr. Willman says 0 *T*-1.
IBM will face still more competition in coming months.
Amdahl Corp., backed * by Japan's Fujitsu Ltd., has a growing share of the market with its low - priced, IBM - compatible machines.
And National Advanced Systems, a joint venture of Japan's Hitachi Ltd. and General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems, is expected *-1 to unveil a line of powerful IBM - compatible mainframes later this year.

The Berlin Wall still stands.
But the man who *T*-1 built it has fallen.
East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort *PRO* to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.
But while it was a move that *T*-1 stunned the East bloc, it hardly ushers in an era of reform--at least anytime soon.
For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker, who *T*-1 had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut * of the same cloth: Egon Krenz, the most recent internal - security chief and a longtime Honecker protege.
East Germany, it is clear 0 *?*, is no Poland, where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union *T*-2.
Nor is it a Hungary, where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant *PRO* to help *PRO* turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy *T*-2.
Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West.
It raises the long - cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification--a prospect that *T*-1 almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow, Washington and Western Europe.
Mr. Krenz, 52, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 the new party chief just minutes after the Party's 163 - member Central Committee convened in East Berlin.
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed 0 Mr. Honecker had asked *PRO*-2 to be relieved *-1 of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said 0 the 26 - man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday.
(Mr. Honecker was twice hospitalized *-1 this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media.)
ADN said 0 Mr. Honecker, a hard - line Stalinist who *T*-2 in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall, also was relieved *-1 of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military.
Mr. Krenz is expected *-2 to be formally named *-1 to all three positions once the nation's parliament convenes later this week.
Mr. Honecker's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron - handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker, now 77 years old, built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc *T*-1.
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied * by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West.
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers' uprising in 1953.
In Washington, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.
The official line was *PRO* to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz, provided 0 he is willing *PRO*-1 to institute reforms.
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer.
President Bush told reporters: "Whether that {the leadership change} reflects a change in East - West relations, I don't think so.
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker."
One top U.S. expert on East Germany added: "There is no clear - cut champion of reform, that we know of *T*-1, in the East German leadership."
Indeed, Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups.
He said, 0 while dialogue is important, enough forums *ICH*-1 already exist "in which different interests" can express themselves *T*-2.
The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party.
According to West German government sources, Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week *PRO*-1 to delay any decisions about a leadership change.
But, with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity, Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle, officials say 0 *T*-1.
Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag, who *T*-1 has long headed economic affairs, and Joachim Hermann, chief of information policy.
Both men were also relieved *-1 of their duties yesterday.
Although other resignations may follow, it *EXP*-1's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government's resistance to fundamental change *T*-2.
Clearly, the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz.
*PRO*-1 Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended *T*-2.
Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he represents the postwar generation that *T*-1 has grown up during Germany's division.
Since *PRO*-1 joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member, Mr. Krenz had acquired the nickname "crown prince," a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand - picked successor to Mr. Honecker.
In fact, the two men have had strikingly similar career paths, both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position.
Moreover, both men have hewn to a similar hard - line philosophy.
Notably, one of Mr. Krenz's few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing *T*-1.
He later defended the Chinese government's response during a separate visit to West Germany.
East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz, in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed *-2 to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who *T*-1 had sought refuge in the Church *T*-3.
However, Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for *PRO*-1 being politically savvy.
His shrewd ability *PRO* to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated *-1 by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. Honecker.
Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that *T*-1 toppled Mr. Honecker.
In recent days, Mr. Krenz has sought *PRO*-1 to project a kinder image.
According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin, it was Mr. Krenz who *T*-1 ordered police *PRO*-4 to stop *-2 using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig.
"He doesn't want *PRO*-1 to have the image of the gun man," says *T*-2 Fred Oldenburg, an expert at the Bonn - sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne.
"He's not a reformer--he wants *PRO*-1 to have the image of a reformer."
As part of his image polishing, Mr. Krenz is expected *-1 to take modest steps toward reform *PRO*-3 to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority.
Besides *PRO*-2 sacking other senior Politburo officials who *T*-1 allied themselves with Mr. Honecker, Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups.
But will it be enough?
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful.
"He doesn't signify what people want *T*-1, so the unrest will go on," Mr. Oldenburg predicts *T*-2.
At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue *-1 to grow.
Says *ICH*-2 one West German official: "What *T*-1's necessary now is the process of democratization.
Not just that people are being heard *-1 but that their interests are being taken *-2 seriously."
Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz *PRO*-1 to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects.
Reports in the West German press, *PRO*-1 citing sources in East Germany, suggest 0 Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader.
Adding to that speculation is *T*-2 Mr. Krenz's reputation as a heavy drinker, who *T*-1 is said *-3 to also suffer from diabetes.
"This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step," the Bonn official adds *T*-1.
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany's rigid stance.
Two reform - minded party leaders favored * by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker, Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, were passed *-1 over.
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify.
In Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that *T*-1 appeared *-2 to urge the new leadership *PRO*-3 to heed growing calls for change.
According to the Soviet news agency Tass, "Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of {East} Germany, *PRO*-2 being sensitive to the demands of the time,...will find solutions to complicated problems 0 the GDR {German Democratic Republic} encountered *T*-1."
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country.
The older generation has been torn *-1 between a fear of *PRO*-1 tampering with the status quo and a fear of what *T*-2 might happen if they didn't *?*.
From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that *T*-1 smack of capitalism and Western - style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being.
Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War.
*PRO* Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering 0 that implies *T*-1, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map.
Which *T*-1 is what the Old Guard fears *T*-2.
"I'm sure 0 they'll formulate a reform that *T*-2 will be a recipe for the GDR's future as a separately identifiable state," says *T*-4 Michael Simmons, a British journalist whose book on East Germany, entitled * *PRO*-5 "The Unloved Country," *T*-3 was published *-1 this month.
Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort *ICH*-1 by former leader Walter Ulbricht *PRO* to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed * by Mr. Honecker's campaign *PRO* to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.
Neither man achieved perfection.
Early in 1987, Mr. Honecker and his team stopped *-1 paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in *PRO* rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems.
The less - self - confident Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians, in contrast, declared their intentions *PRO* to reform, while *PRO*-1 doing nothing concrete about it.
The East German media soon began *-1 presenting Mr. Gorbachev's speeches only as sketchy summaries, and giving space to his opponents.
By late 1988, they were banning Soviet publications.
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to *PRO*-1 insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought *-2 to travel its own road.
Mr. Honecker spoke of "generally valid objective laws of socialism" and left no room for debate.
With this year's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union, and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary, the East German leadership grew still more defensive.
Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a "grave concern" over Hungarian democracy.
"Under the banner that *T*-2 proclaims the ` renewal of socialism,"' he said *?*, "forces *ICH*-1 are at work that *T*-5 are striving *PRO*-3 to eliminate socialism."
Some loyal voices, in *RNR*-1 and out of *RNR*-1 the East German Communist party, saw the nation's unrest coming.
The first signs were economic.
Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries, East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead.
In 1988, for the first time, economic growth came to a dead stop.
Gingerly, some economists began *-1 to blame central planning.
Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of *PRO* introducing democracy, at least in the workplace.
By summer, an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered *T*-1 before.
But they are stalwart socialists.
Their proclaimed purpose is *PRO* to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the West.
One of their pastors has envisioned a "new utopia" of "creative socialism."
Meanwhile, the man 0 Mr. Krenz replaces *T*-1 has left an indelible mark on East German society.
*PRO*-2 Imprisoned *-3 by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who *T*-1 took their cues from Moscow.
He was a "socialist warrior" who *T*-1 felt *PRO*-2 rankled *-3 by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal *PRO* to recognize the legitimacy of his state.
Finally, during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition 0 he had long sought *T*-1.
But ultimately he was undone *-1 by forces unleashed * by his own comrade, Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Honecker's removal "was bound *-1 to happen," says *T*-2 one aide to Chancellor Kohl.
"It was only a matter of time."
The European Community Commission increased its forecast for economic growth in the EC in 1989 to 3.5%, slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25%.
In its annual economic report for 1989 - 1990, the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 EC members at 3%.
EC inflation was seen *-3 at 4.8% in 1989, higher than 1988's 3.6% price rise.
However, inflation for 1990 was seen *-1 slowing to 4.5%.

Slower growth countries included Greece, at 2.5%, the U.K., at 2.25%, and Denmark, at 1.75%.
Inflation is expected *-2 to be highest in Greece, where it is projected *-1 at 14.25% *T*-3, and Portugal, at 13%.
At the other end of the spectrum, West German inflation was forecast *-1 at 3% in 1989 and 2.75% in 1990.
Nestle Korea Ltd. opened a coffee and non-dairy - creamer plant in Chongju, South Korea.
An official at Nestle Korea, a 50 - 50 joint venture between Nestle S.A. and the Doosan Group, said 0 the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble, roasted and ground coffee, coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer.

Brands made * by the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos. had about 95% of the market share.
Nestle currently has only about a 2% share with its Taster's Choice coffee.
Poland plans *PRO*-1 to start negotiations *ICH*-3 soon on *PRO* purchasing natural gas from Iran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported 0 *T*-2.
The agency said 0 Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi of Poland's willingess *PRO* to purchase the gas during Mr. Vaezi's current visit to Warsaw.
The agency didn't mention possible quantities and didn't say how the gas would be delivered *-1 *T*-2.
A Chinese official harshly criticized plans *PRO* to close a British naval base in downtown Hong Kong.
Hong Kong officials announced last week that the base will be relocated *-1 to a small island *PRO* to allow downtown redevelopment.
But Beijing wants *PRO*-1 to use the base for the People's Liberation Army after 1997, when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty *T*-2.

The chairman *RNR*-3 and a director *RNR*-3 of one of the Republic of Singapore's leading property companies, City Development Ltd., or CDL, were charged *-4 yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 Singapore dollars (about US$409,000 *U*).
Kwek Hong Png, chairman of CDL, and director Quek Leng Chye were arrested *-1 by the republic's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night.
In addition to *PRO*-3 abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust, Kwek Hong Png was also charged *-3 with *PRO*-3 dishonestly receiving US$500,000 *U* that *T*-2 had been stolen *-1.
Both men were charged *-1 in a subordinate court and released *-1 on bail of US$1 million *U*.
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning CDL that *T*-1 have depressed the company's share price *NOT* and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned * by CDL's controlling Quek family, brokers in Singapore say 0 *T*-3.
The Queks control the Hong Leong Group, which *T*-1 has widespread interests in manufacturing, property and finance in both Malaysia and Singapore.
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped *PRO* to push prices on the Singapore Stock market *PRO*-2 sharply lower in early trading yesterday, but brokers said that the market and CDL shares recovered once it *EXP*-4 became apparent 0 the charges were limited *-5 to the two men personally.

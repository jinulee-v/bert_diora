The House Ethics Committee officially cited Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif .) for *PRO*-1 sexually harassing two female employees, but didn't recommend formal disciplinary action.
Rep. Bates said 0 he accepted the finding, but one of the victims, Dorena Bertussi, denounced the ethics panel's action as "absurd."
*PRO*-2 Acting more than a year after Ms. Bertussi filed a complaint, the panel issued a "letter of reproval" saying 0 Rep. Bates had admitted conduct that *T*-1 violated a House rule forbidding discrimination against employees on account of their sex.
It ordered Rep. Bates *PRO*-1 to write letters of apology to Ms. Bertussi and to a second complainant, Karen Dryden.
Rep. Bates said 0 he would write the letters as *PRO* ordered *-1.
"I accept the resolution of the matter by the Ethics Committee," he said *T*-1.
The panel also warned Rep. Bates that any further violations "may result in a recommendation that disciplinary action be considered *-1."
But Ms. Bertussi asked, "Who in their right mind *T*-1 is going *-2 to file another complaint with the Ethics Committee?"
Rep. Bates has publicly begged for forgiveness from voters and was re-elected *-1 with 60% of the vote last November.

Steven C. Walker, senior vice president of this bank holding company, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president, chief executive officer and a director of both Commercial National and Commercial National Bank.
He succeeds James E. Burt III, who *T*-1 resigned from all three posts *PRO*-2 to pursue other interests.
The lethal shudders that *T*-1 wracked the San Francisco Bay Area--rated *PRO* *PRO*-2 a 6.9 on the Richter scale--didn't match the great earthquake of 1906, rated * at 8.25.
The difference of just 1.35 points on the scale, designed * by Charles Richter of CalTech in the 1930s, means 0 the older quake was "10 to 20 times stronger," says *T*-1 Lane Johnson, director of the University of California Berkeley Seismographic Station.
The ground ruptured along a 20 - to - 30 - mile stretch of the San Andreas Fault on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson added 0 *T*-1.
In 1906, the rupture was 300 miles long and a couple feet wide.
Though the epicenter of Tuesday's temblor was located *-1 10 miles north of the town of Santa Cruz, and 50 miles south of San Francisco, its havoc hopscotched up the coast in seemingly random fashion.
But the greatest damage was visited *-1 on buildings and roadways perched * upon landfill, as were *?* the Marina District of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge--two areas of maximum devastation.
"Landfill--loose and unconsolidated earth--may feel like rock but it behaves like liquid when you shake it *T*-1," said *T*-2 Douglas Segar, professor of geosciences at San Francisco State University in a televised interview.
"It liquefies in a patchwork quilt pattern.
Our quake behaved much like the Mexico City earthquake, where great damage was miles from the epicenter *T*-1."
Mr. Johnson, of the Berkeley seismographic station, said: "Landfill can be done *-2 if it's properly compacted *-1.
You can drive piles on it and build on it."
He cited the example of San Francisco's financial district, where many new glass towers survived *PRO*-2 almost unscathed *T*-1.
But the public policy issues raised * by earthquake damage will be difficult 0 *PRO* to address *T*-1, Mr. Johnson predicted 0 *T*-2.
"The attention span of the public is short," he said *T*-1.
"We've known for years and years 0 we've got lots of old {pre-1950s} unreinforced brick and masonry buildings."
One old building, the Golden State Bank Building on Front Street, had its yellow brick facade sheared *-1 off by the shock of the quake, *PRO* leaving a wedge of its third floor *PRO*-3 open to the air, while piles of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below *PRO*-2 narrowly missing rush - hour pedestrians and cars.
*PRO* Reinforcing such old building stock, Mr. Johnson said 0 *?*, "comes down to money.
It's a danger.
We know 0 it's there.
And sooner or later, we have *-1 to do something about it."
The urgency is heightened *-1 because this week's earthquake--while *PRO* major and followed * by hundreds of aftershocks--didn't release enough pent - up energy tension *ICH*-2 along the faultlines *PRO* to preclude more and bigger quakes soon.
"The big one is still due," Mr. Johnson predicted *T*-1 in an interview.
"The Bay Area has three very dangerous faults, the San Andreas, the Hayward fault and the Calaveras fault.
It {Tuesday's quake} hasn't solved our problem.
In California, this is the reality.
The public sector borrowing requirement, the most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or surplus, showed a deficit of #200 million *U* in September, compared with a deficit of #765 million *U* in August and a deficit of #1.08 billion *U* in September 1988, the Treasury said 0 *T*-1.
In the six months since the current fiscal year began April 1, the surplus totaled #500 million *U*, compared with a surplus of #3.6 billion *U* in the year - earlier period.
The government is projecting a #14 billion *U* surplus for the fiscal year.
The reported figures for the public sector borrowing requirement include receipts from the sale of state - owned industries.
*PRO* Excluding those receipts, the government deficit would have totaled about #2.5 billion *U* in the first six months, compared with #1.3 billion *U* a year earlier, the Treasury said 0 *T*-1.
Sotheby's Inc., the world's biggest auction house, is taking a huge Wall Street - style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of John T. Dorrance Jr., the Campbell Soup Co. heir.
The Financial Services division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $100 million *U* for the collection, regardless of what the bids for the art works total *T*-1, people close to the transaction say 0 *T*-2.
The collection, which *T*-1 includes two early Picassos, a van Gogh, a Monet, other paintings, furniture and porcelains, went on sale last night in the first of six auctions.
What Sotheby's is doing *T*-1 closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank.
A corporation that *T*-1 wants *PRO*-3 to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm, which *T*-2 purchases the securities outright, *PRO*-4 accepting the financial risk of *PRO*-5 finding buyers.
If the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer *?*, it makes a profit.
At the initial sale last night, for example--the sale featuring the Impressionists masters--bids totaled $116 million *U*.
That was slightly above Sotheby's presale estimate of $111 million *U*.
Normally, Sotheby's would have earned 20% of the total in commissions.
Instead, people familiar with the transaction said 0 *?*, the auction house opted *PRO*-1 to forgo that percentage in order *PRO*-1 to obtain the collection and in exchange for *PRO*-1 taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $100 million *U*.
Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price, a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented.
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America division, vehemently denies 0 it offered the Dorrance heirs a money - back guarantee, *PRO*-1 calling such reports "*PRO*-2 inaccurate."
*PRO*-2 Buried *-1 in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale, however, appears the statement, "Sotheby's has an interest in the property in this catalog."
Explains 0 *ICH*-2 a Sotheby's spokeswoman, the statement "means exactly what it says *T*-1.
We have some level of financial interest" in the collection.
"We don't disclose specifics."
Frank Mirabello, a lawyer for the Dorrance estate with the Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, declines *PRO*-1 to comment on the financial arrangements.
Sotheby's made the $100 million *U* guarantee *PRO*-1 to keep the Dorrance collection away from its archrival, auction house Christie's International PLC; Christie's has handled smaller sales for the Dorrance family over the years.
When Christie's officials asked why the firm wasn't picked *-3 *PRO*-4 to sell the Dorrance collection *T*-5 *T*-2, representatives of the Dorrance family "told us 0 it was a question of financial considerations," said 0 *T*-1 Michael Findlay, Christie's head of impressionist and modern paintings.
Collectors who *T*-1 have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped *PRO*-2 fuel the art boom, but recently it appears 0 Sotheby's has been returning the compliment.
In November 1987, Sotheby's essentially offered a Wall Street - style "bridge loan" of about $27 million *U* to Australian businessman Alan Bond *PRO*-1 to enable him *PRO*-2 to purchase Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million *U*.
It was the highest bid in history for a work of art.
But two weeks ago, Sotheby's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid *-1.
Sotheby's is offering such deals because it's an art sellers' market, at least where the best works are concerned *-1 *T*-3, says 0 *T*-2 Ralph Lerner, an attorney and author of the book "Art Law."
"There seems *-1 to be a lot of art for sale, but there's more competition.
The competition gives the seller the ability *PRO* to cut a better deal," he says 0 *T*-1.
The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $100 million *U*, people familiar with the transaction said 0 *T*-1.
But it *EXP*-1's likely that Sotheby's will take a higher than usual commission, called *PRO* *PRO*-2 an override, on the amount exceeding the guarantee.
Sotheby's has been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale.
At a news conference last May announcing plans for the auction, Sotheby's estimated its value in excess of $100 million *U*.
More recently, Sotheby's has predicted 0 the collection will fetch $140 million *U*.
That's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history.
The decision *PRO* to put the entire collection on the block stunned many, since Mr. Dorrance had served as chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and it *EXP*-3 had been assumed *-1 0 many of the works would be donated *-2 to the institution.
At last night's sale, 13 of 44 works that *T*-2 sold were purchased *-1 by Aska International Gallery, the art - acquisition unit of Aichi Financial, a Japanese conglomerate that *T*-3 owns 7.5% of Christie's.
Meanwhile, Sotheby's guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world.
"The consumer has *-1 to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman," says *T*-2 New York art dealer David Tunick.
While he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who *T*-1 sell works in which they have a financial interest *T*-3, "It ought *PRO*-2 not to be hidden *-4 in some small print."
In such situations, he says, the house "is going *-1 to put the best light on things."
For example, an auction house's comments on the condition of a work of art that *T*-2 is up for sale should be looked at *-1 with "very open eyes," he says 0 *T*-3.
"There's more and more of this cash - up - front going on at every level," says *T*-1 Bruce Miller, president of Art Funding Corp., an art lender.
Dealers and auction houses "know 0 if they don't lay out a half a million for this, another one will *?*; it's that competitive."
In January, two small New York galleries, the Coe Kerr Gallery and Beadleston Fine Arts, snatched a major art collection owned * by the Askin family away from rival auction - house bidders with an up - front payment of about $25 million *U*.
A Christie's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller's commission *PRO*-1 to attract art works--it still gets a commission from the buyer--Christie's won't offer financial guarantees because "Christie's believes 0 its primary role is as an auction house, and therefore as an agent {for buyer and seller}, not as a bank.
StatesWest Airlines said 0 it submitted an offer *ICH*-1 to the directors of Mesa Airlines *PRO* to acquire the Farmington, N.M., carrier.
Except *PRO*-1 to characterize its offer as "fair and generous and in the best interests of Mesa shareholders," StatesWest declined *PRO*-1 to discuss details of its proposal.
It also asked Mesa *PRO*-1 to keep the proposal *PRO*-2 confidential.
A Mesa official confirmed receipt of the offer and said 0 directors would meet *PRO*-1 to consider it.
Last week, Mesa rejected a proposal *ICH*-1 by StatesWest *PRO* to acquire it or merge.
StatesWest has a 7.25% stake in Mesa, which *T*-1 operates 20 twin - engine *RNR*-2 and two single - engine *RNR*-2 turboprops among 42 cities in New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado and Texas.
StatesWest operates four twin - engine turboprop aircraft, *PRO*-1 connecting 10 cities in California, Arizona and Nevada.
The carrier hasn't yet turned a profit.
South Africa negotiated a new debt agreement *ICH*-1 with its major foreign creditors for about $8 billion *U* of its foreign debt outstanding, said 0 *T*-2 Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank and the country's chief debt negotiator.
The new agreement will last for 3 1/2 years starting July 1, 1990, when the current agreement expires *T*-1.
The announcement coincides with the start of the Commonwealth Ministers Conference in Kuala Lumpur, where proposals for renewed sanctions against South Africa, including moves 0 *T*-2 to block settling of a new debt agreement, were scheduled *-3 to be discussed *-1 *T*-4.
As with the previous pact, the new agreement covers the country's debt "inside the net," which *T*-1 applies mainly to repayments due to overseas creditor banks by the private sector.
The agreement calls for South African debtors to make repayments in eight installments, starting in December of next year.
The redemption then would be at 1.5% of the total debt, *PRO*-1 increasing to 2.5% in February 1991 *NOT*, and to 3% at six - month intervals thereafter.
A revised provision *ICH*-2 would be included *-1 for the conversion of short - term claims inside the net to long - term loans outside the net.
These claims would be repayable over a 10 - year period.
Foreign debt falling outside the net of affected indebtedness--which Mr. Stahl estimated *T*-1 at $12 billion *U*--would remain not subject to the debt arrangements.
The Canadian government auctioned 750 million Canadian dollars (US$637.5 million *U*) of 9.25% bonds due Dec. 15, 1994.
The average accepted yield bid * was 9.617% for a price equivalent of 98.523.
Proceeds of the sale will be used *-1 *PRO*-2 to redeem C$675 million *U* of government bonds maturing Nov. 1 and for general government purposes.
The stock market's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish 0 they could buy some sort of insurance.
After all, they won't soon forget the stock bargains that *T*-1 became available after the October 1987 crash.
But while they want *PRO*-2 to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now, they're afraid of *PRO*-3 being hammered *-1 by another terrifying plunge.
The solution, at least for some investors, may be a hedging technique that *T*-1's well known to players in the stock - options market.
*PRO*-2 Called *-1 *PRO*-3 a "married put," the technique is carried *-2 out by *PRO* purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock.
It's like "fire insurance," says 0 *T*-1 Harrison Roth, the senior options strategist at Cowen & Co.
Because a put option gives its owner the right *RNR*-1, but not the obligation *RNR*-1, *PRO* to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option's expiration date, the investor is protected *-2 against a sudden drop in the stock's price.
But most investment advisers don't recommend *PRO* using married puts all the time.
That's because the cost of *PRO* buying put options eats into an investor's profit when stock prices rise *T*-1.
"This is the type of fire insurance 0 you only buy *T*-1 when the nearby woods are on fire *T*-3," says *T*-2 Mr. Roth.
"You always want your house insured *-2, but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured *-1."
In addition to *PRO* hedging new stock purchases, the married - put technique can be used *-2 *PRO* to protect stocks that an investor already owns *T*-1.
In either case, the investor faces three possible outcomes:
-- If the stock goes up in price between now and the put's expiration date, the put will probably expire *PRO*-1 worthless.
The investor will be out the cost of the put, which *T*-2 is called *-1 *PRO*-3 the "premium," and this loss will reduce the stock - market profit.
-- If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date, the investor's loss will be limited *-1 to the cost of the put, less any amount realized * from a closing sale of the put.
The worst - case scenario would be if the put expires *PRO*-1 worthless.
-- If the price of the stock declines, the put will increase in value.
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar.
The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life.
When a stock falls below the put's strike price *T*-1, the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit.
Or, the investor can exercise the put, by *PRO*-2 tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who *T*-1 has sold a put on the same stock.
Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp., which *T*-1 guarantees all option trades.
The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks *T*-1.
Though *PRO* not reflected *-3 in the table, an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset *-1 by any dividends that the stock pays *T*-2.
For example, Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents, which *T*-1 would be received *-2 before the February option expires and, thus, reduce the cost of *PRO* using the technique by that amount.
In this case, the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment.
*PRO* To simplify the calculations, commissions on the option and underlying stock aren't included *-1 in the table.
There are more than 650 stocks on which options *T*-2 may be bought and sold *-1, including some over - the - counter stocks.
But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then *PRO* hedging their individual holdings.
They can do this by *PRO*-3 purchasing "index puts," which *T*-1 are simply put options on indexes that *T*-2 match broad baskets of stocks.
For instance, the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option, commonly called *PRO* *PRO*-1 the OEX.
It is based *-1 on the stocks that *T*-2 make up Standard & Poor's 100-stock index.
Unlike options on individual issues, index options are settled *-1 only in cash, and no stock is ever tendered *-2.
But while index options are convenient, they have several disadvantages.
For one thing, an investor's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100.
As a result, the OEX insurance may *RNR*-1 or may not *RNR*-1 fully protect an investor's holdings in the event of a market decline.
In addition, OEX options were suspended *-501 from trading last Friday afternoon, after the stock - market sell - off got under way and trading in the S&P - 500 futures contract was halted *-502.
So an investor who *T*-1 wanted *PRO*-2 to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck.
On the other hand, only a handful of individual issues were suspended *-1 from trading on Friday.
Normally, once the underlying investment is suspended *-1 from trading, the options on those investments also don't trade.
Ultimately, whether the insurance provided * by *PRO* purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.
That cost rises in times of high market volatility.
But it still might be cheaper than *PRO* taking a major hit.
The protection from *PRO* using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded * by another options strategy 0 some investors consider *PRO*-3 using *T*-2 during troubled times: *PRO* selling call options on stocks 0 the investor owns *T*-1.
A call option is similar to a put, except that it gives its owner the right *PRO* to buy shares at a stated price until expiration.
*PRO* Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock - market decline.
That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received * from the sale of the call.
But if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option, the stock is almost certain *-1 to be called *-2 away.
And in that case, the investor misses out on any major upside gain.
These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid * and dividends received * from the stock.
All prices are as of Monday's close.
(During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that *T*-1 stand as milestones of American business history.)
THE YOM KIPPUR WAR, WHEN EGYPT CRASHED into Israel on Oct. 6, 1973, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar *T*-1, lasted barely a month.
But one far - afield effect is still with us.
The Arab states, always bitterly resentful of U.S. support toward Israel, realized 0 they held an irresistable weapon--oil.
Early in October, six Arab nations in the Persian Gulf jacked up prices sharply.
On Oct. 22, *PRO*-2 led *-1 by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, they embargoed oil shipments to the U.S. and to the Netherlands, Israel's staunchest European ally.
The timing was perfect.
The Arabs had tried embargos before.
In 1956, when Britain, France and Israel invaded Egypt *PRO*-1 to seize the Suez Canal *T*-2, Arab producers cut off supplies to Europe.
Texas simply pumped harder.
U.S. oil supplies, however, had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining.
Imports, then six million barrels a day, came primarily from Venezuela and Canada.
But Middle East supplies were growing in importance.
By 1973, the U.S. was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day, more than 10% of the 17.3 million barrels consumed * daily.
Politics and economics conspired.
Japan and Europe, far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S., wouldn't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies.
The U.S. did manage *PRO*-2 to supply the Dutch with oil by *PRO*-3 relabeling supplies; once oil is shipped *-1, no one can tell its source.
But car - happy Americans panicked, and so did *T*-1 the U.S. and other oil - consuming governments.
"Shortage" and "crisis" became buzz words, although neither really applied.
The spot dislocations that *T*-1 showed up were largely the result of confusion (much of it in Washington), though that was cold comfort for drivers waiting in mile - long lines at the gas pumps.
The embargo lasted only six months, but the price hikes became a fact of life.
What the Arabs started *T*-1, inflation finished *T*-2.
Once and for all, $5 *U* - a - barrel crude oil and 35 - cents - a - gallon gasoline were history.
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, *PRO*-2 brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued *-1 again, said 0 the currency's current level against the dollar is "appropriate."
His comments, made * in response to reporters' questions at the National Press Club here, signaled that Seoul is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency's value.
The U.S. wants a higher won *PRO* to make South Korea's exports more expensive and help *PRO*-1 trim Seoul's trade surplus.
Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead, *PRO*-1 arguing that the won's recent gains already have weakened the country's export performance.
Mr. Roh also said 0 South Korea is taking steps that *T*-1 would free the won *PRO*-2 to respond to market forces.
Seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason 0 the won's value remains heavily controlled *T*-1.
Mr. Roh said 0 a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved *-1 "satisfactorily" but gave no hint when that will happen *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Speaking to a joint meeting of Congress earlier, he said 0 South Korea can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues "without *PRO*-2 causing political and social trauma.
NCNB Corp. raised $1 billion *U* in new capital during the third quarter.
In yesterday's edition, the amount of new capital was misstated *-1.
Cincinnati Microwave Inc. said 0 it introduced two radar detectors.
One unit, called *PRO* *PRO*-3 the Escort, uses a new digital signal - processing technology *PRO*-1 to detect radar signals much sooner than *PRO* was previously possible, the company said 0 *T*-2.
The other, called *PRO* *PRO*-3 the Solo, is battery operated and is the first high - performance radar detector that *T*-1 doesn't need a power cord, the company said 0 *T*-2.
Whether or not "great cases make bad - law"--as Justice Holmes asserted *?*--who *T*-1 can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee's response to these great cases *T*-2 they make bad judicial history?
Ethan Bronner's "Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America *T*-1" (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50 *U*) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done * with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.
While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious.
What *T*-1 shook America was not a battle for justice but for naked power, in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge 0 they had demonized *T*-2 *T*-3.
In its basic structure and style the book is novelistic, with piquant character portrayal, hard - wire action and devious intrigue of the sort more likely *PRO* to be encountered *-1 in a Washington docudrama than in a constitutional history.
Mr. Bronner seems *-1 to believe that the hearings could have gone either way.
I doubt that.
Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. Bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings, it *EXP*-2 was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of *PRO* being confirmed *-1.
As Mr. Bronner himself says 0 *?*, the smell of "raw meat" was in the air.
Perhaps because they won, Mr. Bork's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders.
Ralph Neas was the organizing genius, *PRO*-1 whipping a conglomerate of pressure groups into an irresistible attacking force.
Harvard's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy, *PRO*-2 laying out legal strategies 0 for the senators and witnesses to follow *T*-1.
But it was Ted Kennedy who *T*-1 scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America"--the parade of imaginary horribles that *T*-2 would follow logically, he claimed 0 *?*, from the positions 0 Mr. Bork had taken *T*-3 over the space of two decades.
Sen. Kennedy, *PRO* never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground, emoted brilliantly.
I add two others.
Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania engaged the nominee in a verbal contest aimed * at *PRO*-1 showing that Mr. Bork was willing *PRO*-2 to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while *PRO*-2 remaining rigid in all the others.
It achieved a good media play, and enabled Sen. Specter and others *PRO*-1 to vote against Mr. Bork out of "conscience."
Further ammunition came from left legal theorist Ronald Dworkin, who in the New York Review of Books *T*-1 painted a picture of a constitutional zombie willfully reading his personal prejudices into the Constitution, particularly in the area of "original intent."
The charge of *PRO* being "outside the mainstream" of legal thought gravely undercut Mr. Bork's scholarly standing, *PRO*-1 leaving him *PRO*-2 bleeding on the platform.
The nomination still might have been salvaged *-1 if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines.
But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin 0 *T*-1 to punish them in their next Senate elections.
Demographics converged with "mainstream" and demonizing *PRO*-1 to seal Robert Bork's fate.
The upshot?
Mr. Bork's opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it.
Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war.
Another upshot, however, was the chilling message 0 the Bork hearings sent *T*-1 into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent *T*-2.
The word *ICH*-1 went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey, with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen.
Unfortunately, the author simply doesn't supply the philosophical frame 0 *T*-1 to sustain his reportorial talents.
He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture.
*PRO*-1 Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.
He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. Bork's closest friend at Yale, whose influence on the judge *T*-1 goes well beyond Mr. Bronner's reporting.
Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one.
His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which *T*-1 keeps the Court *PRO*-2 clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.
Unfortunately, Mr. Bork failed *-2 to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that *T*-3 must be settled *-1 judicially if it is *-4 to cohere.
The question of segregated schools, in Brown vs. Board of Education, was such an issue.
In our time abortion has become another, best left * to a line of Supreme Court decisions rather than to the chaos of 50 state legislatures.
A reflective and growing consensus of Americans clearly wishes *PRO*-1 to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters (decided * in the Griswold case) to abortion as well.
One can understand Mr. Bork's fear that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched *-1, though a Supreme Court composed * of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able *PRO*-2 to manage it.
What *T*-1 is certain is that if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus, it will be at their peril.

Zurn Industries Inc. said 0 it received approval *PRO* to proceed on four separate projects with a total contract value of $59 million *U*.
The projects include construction of a 29,400 kilowatt waste - to - energy plant for Ada Cogeneration L.P., Ada, Mich.; a steam generating plant at Ontario, Calif., that Zurn will own and operate *T*-1, and two waste - water control projects in Orange County, Calif.
A surprising surge in the U.S. trade deficit raised fears that the nation's export drive has stalled, and caused new turmoil in financial markets.
The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion *U* *ICH*-2, the Commerce Department reported 0 *?*, a sharp deterioration from July's $8.24 billion *U* and the largest deficit of any month this year.
Exports fell for the second month in a row, while imports rose to a record.
"This is one of the worst trade releases 0 we've had *T*-2 since the dollar troughed out in 1987," said *T*-1 Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc.
Like most analysts, Mr. Dennis was hesitant *PRO*-1 to read too much into one month's numbers; but he said, "It indicates perhaps that the balance in the U.S. economy is not as good as we've been led *-2 *PRO*-3 to believe."
The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street, *PRO* suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may underlie last Friday's stock market slide.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report's release, before *PRO*-1 recovering *PRO*-2 to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73.
"This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline," said *T*-1 Norman Robertson, chief economist for Mellon Bank.
"It raises questions about more deep - seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability *PRO* to come to grips with them."
The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987.
On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped *PRO*-1 trigger a steep market decline.
The slide continued until the record 508 - point market drop on Oct. 19.
In 1987, however, the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade, while the current report comes after a period of improvement.
The bleak trade report was played *-1 down by the Bush administration.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures "disappointing *PRO*-1 after two very good months."
And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 0 the deficit was "an unwelcome increase," *PRO*-1 adding that "we're hopeful that it simply is a one - month situation and will turn around."
But the figures reinforced the view *ICH*-1 of many private analysts that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam.
"The figures today add further evidence 0 *T*-1 to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion *U* annual rate," said *T*-2 Jeffrey Scott, a research fellow at the Institute for International Economics here.
"That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one *PRO*-2 to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage 0 we can *?* *T*-1 out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit."
Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August, *PRO*-1 slipping 0.2% to $30.41 billion *U*, the Commerce Department reported 0 *T*-2.
Imports, on the other hand, leaped 6.4% to a record $41.18 billion *U*.
Not only was August's deficit far worse than July's, but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $7.58 billion *U* deficit 0 it had initially reported *T*-1 last month.
Many economists contend that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed *-1 before further trade improvement can occur.
That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, *PRO*-1 overwhelming the nation's capacity *PRO* to export.
"People are sick and tired of *PRO*-2 hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem," said *T*-1 Mr. Robertson.
In addition, the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country's competitiveness.
Since March, exports have been virtually flat.
At the same time, William T. Archey, international vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, notes: "Clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive" by *PRO*-1 causing their prices to decline.
Most economists expect the slowing U.S. economy to curb demand for imports.
But they foresee little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down.
"The best result 0 we could get *T*-1 from these numbers would be *PRO* to see the administration and Congress get serious about *PRO* putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing," said *T*-2 Howard Lewis, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
"That must start with *PRO* cutting the federal budget deficit."
August's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies, capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles, parts and engines.
The jump in imports stemmed from across - the - board increases in purchases of foreign goods.
The numbers were adjusted *-1 for usual seasonal fluctuations.

Northgate Exploration Ltd. said 0 it is proposing *PRO*-1 to amalgamate four of its associated companies.
Under a proposed two - step amalgamation involving share swaps, ABM Gold Corp., a gold exploration and management company, will merge with Neptune Resources Corp., United Gold Corp. and Inca Resources Inc.
ABM will also increase its stake in Sonora Gold Corp. to 42% from 26%.
Northgate said 0 it will own about 50% of the equity *RNR*-1 and 81% of the votes *RNR*-1 of ABM after the amalgamation.
The amalgamations are subject to regulatory approval and require approval by shareholders of ABM, Inca, United and Neptune at special meetings on Nov. 10.

Figgie is a fire protection, electronics and industrial products concern.
Prospect Group Inc., whose recent hostile tender offer for Recognition Equipment Inc. *T*-1 failed for lack of financing, apparently has gained a measure of control over the troubled company anyway.
As part of what a Recognition spokeswoman termed *T*-1 *PRO*-2 an "amiable agreement," Prospect Group will wind up with control of top management posts and an increased stake in the maker of data management equipment.
In a management restructuring, Thomas L. Ringer resigned as chairman, chief executive and a director, while Israel Sheinberg resigned as a director.
Mr. Sheinberg remains as executive vice president.
Thomas M. Hurley and Robert A. Vanourek, who *T*-2 had been designated *-3 *PRO*-5 to take over Recognition's top spots had Prospect's tender offer succeeded, were named *-1 *PRO*-4 co-chief executives and directors.
Mr. Hurley was formerly a vice president and general manager of an Avery International division; Mr. Vanourek was a former group vice president of Pitney Bowes Inc.
In addition, the agreement calls for Gilbert H. Lamphere, chairman of Prospect Group's executive committee, to be named *-1 *PRO*-3 chairman of a restructured board that *T*-2 will include four new independent directors.
Also named *-2 to the revised board was *T*-1 Thomas A. Loose, Recognition's senior vice president and general counsel.
Prospect, a New York - based leveraged buy - out firm, also agreed *PRO*-2 to invest $15 million *U* in Recognition, which *T*-1 in turn agreed *PRO*-3 to repurchase as much as $20 million *U* of its stock.
That would increase Prospect's ownership of the company's fully - diluted shares outstanding to 20% from 14.1%.
Under the agreement, Prospect is permitted *-1 *PRO*-2 to increase its stake in Recognition to 30%.
Beyond that, Prospect said 0 it wouldn't offer *PRO*-1 to acquire additional shares for less than $11.25 *U* a share during the next year or less than $14.06 *U* a share during the subsequent two years.
Recognition also said 0 it obtained a commitment *ICH*-2 from Chemical Bank and Bank of Boston *PRO* to convert an estimated $18 million *U* in bank debt to a new, 24 - month secured term loan 0 *T*-3 to be repaid *-1 through the sale of certain assets.
In August, Recognition said 0 it was in violation of certain terms of its debt agreements with bank lenders because of a $3.9 million *U* loss for the third quarter ended July 31.
The company attributed the loss to declining revenue and litigation costs relating to criminal charges against the company and two former executives, William G. Moore Jr. and Robert W. Reedy.
The former executives were indicted *-1 last October on charges of fraud, theft and conspiracy related to efforts *ICH*-2 by the company *PRO* to win $400 million *U* in Postal Service contracts.
Recognition Equipment said 0 it expected *-1 to put the agreement with Prospect to a vote of its stockholders at a special meeting in January.
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Recognition rose 87.5 cents to $6.625 *U*.
Prospect slipped 25 cents to $10.50 *U* in national over - the - counter trading.
Egon Krenz, the man tapped * yesterday *PRO*-2 to become East Germany's new leader, faces the same task that *T*-1 has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues: *PRO* reforming a country in crisis.
But unlike the other new leaders in the East Bloc, Mr. Krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification.
Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known *-1 as an old - guard ironfist, one likely *PRO* to continue the method of *PRO* running a country that the Berlin Wall made *T*-2 famous.
Even if he were *-1 to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of *PRO*-2 losing a country.
Mr. Krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of Erich Honecker, his rigid predecessor as dictator.
Mr. Krenz has followed much the same career path as Mr. Honecker: Both spent years *PRO*-2 overseeing the Freie Deutsche Jugend, the youth group that *T*-1 is the communist regime's principal tool for *PRO* stamping young Germans into socialist citizens.
More recently, Mr. Krenz has been in charge of East German security, and is the youngest member of the ruling Politburo.
*PRO*-1 Faced *-3 with another Mr. Honecker, so many despairing East Germans *ICH*-2 are likely *-1 to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground.
But if East Germany's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough *PRO* to permit Mr. Krenz *PRO*-1 to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental.
*PRO* Abandoning socialism means *PRO* abandoning the East German state's reason for existence, and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall.
In this scenario it *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to imagine that a pale imitation of the Federal Republic could avoid *PRO*-1 being pulled *-3 into some kind of tie--economic, federal or stronger--with West Germany.
Mr. Krenz may need a bit of time *PRO*-2 to consolidate his empire, which *T*-1 would do a lot 0 *T*-3 to promote Reunification Scenario One.
Cartoonists in West Germany have already mocked the exodus by *PRO*-1 imagining an advertisement placed * by Mr. Honecker: "Wanted *-2: one people."
The West German embassies in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are continuing *-1 to find refugees at their gates.
Of course East Germany, *PRO*-1 true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further.
Two of the last gestures of the Honecker regime were *PRO* to close the border to Czechoslovakia and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier.
But with world - wide opinion--even, apparently in Moscow--against East Germany, the country would have *-1 to turn itself into an Albania *PRO*-1 to clamp down further on refugees.
There have been some reports that Mr. Krenz is moving *PRO*-2 to "soften" his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who *T*-1 kept East Germany's state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month.
But even if he effects a Hyde - to - Jekyll transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two.
The problem is one that East Germany shares *T*-1 with other half - states, such as North Korea, but one 0 it must shoulder *T*-2 alone in the East Bloc.
When Poland moves *PRO*-2 to reform *T*-1, it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short - lived Joseph Pilsudski's interwar republic *T*-3, it was a nonsocialist democracy.
Czech reformers can recall the Wilsonian ideals of the same period in their country.
Even the Soviet Union has Peter the Great 0 *PRO* to rediscover *T*-1, should it choose *PRO*-2 to *?*.
But East Germany is merely "the land of truly existing socialism."
Beyond that, it has *-1 to compete with West Germany for a claim to the German identity.
Up to now, the main weapon of the "worker and peasant state" has been the ideology of socialism.
With talk today of a second economic miracle in West Germany, East Germany no longer can content itself with *PRO*-1 being the economic star in a loser league.
Without Moscow's military and party behind it, East Germany runs the risk of disintegrating.
If it goes capitalist, and increases trade with West Germany, it will convert itself, willy - nilly, into an economic annex of the Federal Republic.
There's a certain cruel logic at work here: It *EXP*-3's particularly appropriate--and tragic--that the land that *T*-4 produced Karl Marx should prove *-6 socialism's failure in an experiment that *T*-5 uses its own people as controls.
There may be forces that *T*-1 would delay this scenario.
Ideologues are the last 0 *T*-1 to surrender, and Germans are an ideological people.
The protesters who *T*-1 greeted Mikhail Gorbachev at East Berlin's airport earlier this month weren't shouting "Go U.S.A"--they were chanting "Gorby, *PRO* Help Us."
Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process.
Helmut Kohl's governing conservative coalition is proving *-1 admirably true to the West German constitution by *PRO*-1 making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone.
But within the government and in the think tanks outside it, many West Germans maintain that they don't want immediate reunification.
Politically, this currently is wisdom--particularly given a nervous neighboring France.
But it would be ironic if Germany's reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin.
In a statement that *T*-1 was as close *ICH*-2 as East Germany gets *?* to *PRO* practicing "glasnost", Otto Reinhold, an East German party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma.
"The main problem," Mr. Reinhold said 0 *?* in an East German radio interview monitored * by Radio Free Europe in Munich, stems from the fact that "the GDR is different" from other East European states.
"What kind of right *PRO* to exist," he asked *?*, "would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have *T*-1 alongside a capitalist Federal Republic?"
That's a question 0 East Germany can't answer *T*-2 easily, no matter what its new leader does *T*-1.

Times may be tough on Wall Street for some, but a few bosses are making as much as ever--or more.
At Bear Stearns Cos., for example, the 15 executive officers led * by Chairman Alan "Ace" Greenberg got a pay increase to $35.9 million *U* for the 14 - month period ended June 30 from $22.9 million *U* for the 12 months ended April 30, 1988.
The figures don't include substantial dividends on holdings of Bear Stearns stock.
Mr. Greenberg himself was paid *-1 $4.5 million *U* *ICH*-2, before an estimated $1.5 million *U* in dividends, up from $2.4 million *U* the year before.
The increase is noted *-1 in the brokerage firm's latest proxy statement filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Because it operates on a fiscal year, Bear Stearns's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms.
The latest period includes 14 months instead of 12 because Bear Stearns changed to a fiscal year ending in June instead of April.
Meanwhile, Bear Stearns's 650 stock and bond salesmen saw thinner paychecks over the past year, which the company says 0 *T*-1 reflected lower commission revenue caused * by a decline in investor activity in the markets.
However, Bear Stearns on Monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 29, partly because of a 31% increase in commissions during the quarter.
William J. Montgoris, chief financial officer, defended the lofty salaries at Bear Stearns.
"All of us are on a base salary of $200,000 *U* if the firm makes nothing--and that's pretty low as far as Wall Street goes *?*," Mr. Montgoris said *T*-1.
However, Bear Stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding 65 years ago.
Four Bear Stearns executives besides the 62 - year - old Mr. Greenberg were paid *-1 $3 million *U* or more before dividends for the 14 months ended in June.
According to the proxy statement, James E. Cayne, 55, Bear Stearns's president, made $3.9 million *U*; an executive vice president, Michael L. Tarnopol, 53, made nearly $3.4 million *U*; and two executive vice presidents, Vincent J. Mattone, 44, and William J. Michaelcheck, 42, made about $3.3 million *U* each.
Mr. Montgoris said 0 the firm has a "straight mathematical formula" for *PRO* determining compensation, based on the firm's earnings.
"Just because a particular element of the firm *ICH*-1 is down," such as stockbrokerage, "doesn't mean 0 the executive committee should be paid *-3 less," he said *T*-2.
Donald J. Amaral, 37 years old, was named *-2 *PRO*-3 president and chief operating officer of this owner and operator of hospitals, nursing centers and retirement hotels.
He succeeds as president, Don Freeberg, who *T*-1 remains chairman and chief executive officer.
The position of chief operating officer is new.
Japanese machinery makers received orders totaling 1.465 trillion yen ($10.33 billion *U*) *ICH*-1 in August, up 14% from a year earlier, the Economic Planning Agency said 0 *T*-2.
"Equipment orders on the domestic side were particularly strong in shipping and power utilities," said *T*-1 an agency official.
The latest report compares with a modest 9.9% increase in July machinery orders from a year earlier.
Morgan Grenfell Group PLC said 0 John Craven, group chief executive officer, is taking over the chairmanship of the merchant banking group from Sir Peter Carey, who *T*-1 is retiring.
Mr. Carey will remain a member of the merchant bank's board.
Mr. Craven is widely credited *-1 with *PRO*-1 refocusing Morgan Grenfell's energies on its core corporate finance, fund management and banking activities over the past year.
Last year, Morgan Grenfell shut down its ailing U.K. securities operations.
Mr. Craven said 0 his move to the chairmanship means 0 he will take a less active role in the day - to - day management of the group, but he added that the merchant bank's strategic focus remains unchanged.
Mr. Craven joined Morgan Grenfell as group chief executive in May 1987, a few months after the resignations of former Chief Executive Christopher Reeves and other top officials because of the merchant bank's role in Guinness PLC's controversial takeover of Distiller's Co. in 1986.
Morgan Grenfell had advised Guinness on the bid, which *T*-2 was surrounded *-1 by allegations that Guinness used artificial means *PRO*-3 to support the bid's value.
Morgan Grenfell said 0 Michael Dobson, currently group deputy chief executive, will assume the chief executive position.
The merchant bank also announced that finance director David Eward is taking early retirement for personal reasons.
His duties will be taken *-1 over by Anthony Richmond - Watson, who *T*-3 has been elected *-2 *PRO*-4 deputy chairman.
News of Mr. Eward's retirement comes one day after Morgan said that Christopher Whittington resigned as chairman of Morgan's banking subsidiary *PRO*-1 to join a financial services firm.
Mr. Craven said 0 both Messrs. Eward and Whittington had planned *PRO*-1 to leave the bank earlier, but Mr. Craven had persuaded them *PRO*-2 to remain until the bank was in a healthy position.
"If there's any coincidence about the departures it's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well *T*-1."
Last month, Morgan Grenfell announced 0 its pretax profit rose 49.6% to #32.8 million *U* in the first half, *PRO*-1 boosted *-2 by a healthy growth in its domestic and international corporate finance business.
The Federal National Mortgage Association set up a three - member office of the chairman and elected James A. Johnson as vice chairman, *PRO* effective Jan. 1.
Mr. Johnson has been a managing director at Shearson Lehman Hutton since 1985, and before that was president of Public Strategies, a Washington consulting firm.
He is well - known in Democratic circles, *PRO*-1 having been executive assistant to Vice President Walter Mondale and chairman of Mr. Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign.
At Fannie Mae, he will take responsibility for the corporation's financial and legal areas and will work with David Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer, and Roger Birk, president and chief operating officer, on strategic planning.
Mr. Johnson, 45 years old, has been a consultant on strategy to Fannie Mae for the past 3 1/2 years.
In an interview, he said 0 Fannie Mae faces a number of challenges with the restructuring of the thrift industry and the push *PRO* to broaden its activities overseas.
"There's no shortage of major things 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1," he said *T*-2.
Fannie Mae also said 0 James A. Aliber, chairman of First Federal of Michigan and a director since 1985, moved up the date of his retirement from the board *PRO*-1 to accommodate Mr. Johnson's election as a director.
The board has 13 members elected * by holders and five presidential appointees.
Fannie Mae, a federally chartered, shareholder - owned corporation, operates a secondary market for mortgage loans, *PRO*-1 buying loans from lenders, packaging some into securities for sale to investors and keeping the rest in its portfolio.

In yesterday's edition, it *EXP*-1 was incorrectly stated *-2 that the company's share price has softened since August 1988.
Blinder International Enterprises Inc., the parent of beleaguered penny - stockbroker Blinder, Robinson & Co., said 0 its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to Intercontinental Enterprises Inc.
"The parent company is diversifying into other industries around the world," said *T*-1 president Meyer Blinder in *PRO*-2 explaining the name change.
"Everytime 0 we talked about Blinder International *T*-1, {people} thought 0 it was the brokerage house."
Mr. Blinder said 0 the change wasn't related to the brokerage's recent troubles, which *T*-1 have included sharp declines in earnings, run - ins with the securities regulators and lawsuits by former customers.
The company said 0 it expects the name change to take effect within a week.
Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit - reduction legislation faded as efforts *PRO* to streamline the House version in advance of a House - Senate conference broke down.
House leaders had hoped *PRO*-2 to follow the Senate's lead by *PRO*-3 getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that *T*-1 wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House - passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began *T*-4.
But the effort became snagged *-2 on the question of what *T*-1 would become of other issues, ranging from *PRO* cutting the capital - gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic - illness insurance.
"Many members feel 0 there are important features of the House bill that *T*-2 should be enacted *-1," Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash .) said *T*-3.
"If there is any support for *PRO* reducing the bill, it is conditioned *-1 on their desire *PRO* to see them passed *-2 in another form."
Now those items will be discussed *-1 in a House - Senate conference, which *T*-2 could begin as soon as today, with the expectation that they could either be resolved *-3 there or placed *-3 into other legislation.
"You've got *-2 to give these chairmen the opportunity *PRO* to see if they can work things out," said *T*-1 House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif .).
"This is a democratic process--you can't slam - dunk anything around here."
White House Budget Director Richard Darman has said 0 he would continue *-1 to press *PRO*-2 to keep the capital - gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the House drops many of its costly provisions.
Senate leaders had hoped *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to send a compromise version of the measure to President Bush by the end of the week, but Speaker Foley said 0 that wasn't likely.
Failure *PRO* to pass the bill meant that $16.1 billion *U* in across - the - board spending cuts took effect Monday under the Gramm - Rudman budget law.
The bill must be enacted *-1 before the cuts can be restored *-2.
Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said 0 it named its interim president and chief executive officer, Kenneth I. Sawyer, to those posts permanently, and elected him to the board.
Par also said 0 it was advised *-1 by the U.S. attorney for Maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated * by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
Par, a generic - drug maker that *T*-2 has been plagued *-1 by management problems, was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the drug - approval process and a Food and Drug Administration investigation.
A Par spokesman said 0 he understood 0 the criminal investigation in Maryland relates to matters 0 Par disclosed *T*-1 in July, when Par said 0 it filed false drug information with the FDA *T*-2.
At the time, the company said 0 it was recalling one of its drugs and had stopped *-1 selling two others.
The spokesman said 0 he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an "off - the - record" production book.
The book noted changes made * at the manufacturing level that *T*-1 weren't disclosed *-2 to the FDA.
Par said 0 it is cooperating in the investigation.
Also yesterday, Ashok Patel, a former Par official who *T*-2 pleaded guilty to *PRO*-3 providing an FDA employee an illegal gratuity of $3,000 *U*, was sentenced *-1 by a federal judge in Baltimore to one year of community service and a $150,000 *U* fine.
Mr. Patel also was placed *-1 on three years' probation.
Mr. Patel resigned as senior vice president of Par in April.
In July, Par and a 60% - owned unit agreed *PRO*-1 to plead guilty in that inquiry, as did another former Par official *?*.
Mr. Sawyer began *-1 running the company on an interim basis in late September.
Par said 0 it selected him for the posts of president and chief executive on a permanent basis because of his experience in the industry and his performance at Par.
Perry Levine, chairman, said 0 Mr. Sawyer had "taken significant steps" 0 *T*-1 to restore the company's credibility and sense of professionalism and integrity.
U.S. steel imports in August fell 14% from a year earlier to 1,531,000 tons, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
The trade group's compilation of Commerce Department data showed that August imports, the second largest monthly total of the year, were up 5% from July's 1,458,000 tons but below last year's high of 1,979,000 tons in June 1988.
August imports claimed 18.5% of the U.S. market, compared with 19.3% in July and 20.5% in August 1988.
The latest month's figures show that imports of steel from European Community nations fell to 466,000 tons from 481,000 a month earlier, while imports from Japan rose to 323,000 tons from 288,000 in July.
Imports from Canada rose to 272,000 tons in August from 209,000 in July.
The American Institute for Imported Steel said 0 imports for the first eight months of 1989 were below the level allowed * by the Voluntary Restraint Agreement program.
The institute said that, excluding semifinished steel products, year - to - date imports represented 15.2% of consumption, compared with a permitted maximum of 18.5%.
Grumman Corp. was awarded *-1 a $53.1 million *U* Navy contract for advanced acquisition of six E - 2C tactical control aircraft.

Rockwell International Corp. was issued *-1 a $12.5 million *U* Air Force contract for changes in the National Aerospace Plane.
Crude prices spurted upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to San Francisco area refinery complexes, but the rise quickly fizzled when it *EXP*-1 became apparent that oil operations weren't severely curtailed *-2 *T*-3.
*PRO*-1 Trading on little specific information, market players overnight in Tokyo began *-1 bidding up oil prices.
The rally spread into European markets, where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the San Francisco area's large oil refining plants *T*-1.
By yesterday morning, much of the world was still unable *PRO*-1 to reach San Francisco by telephone.
West Texas Intermediate was bid up more than 20 cents a barrel in many overseas markets.
At the opening of the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate for November delivery shot up 10 cents a barrel, to $20.85 *U*, still on the belief that the refineries were damaged *-1.
In the San Francisco area, roughly 800,000 barrels a day of crude, about a third of all the refining capacity in California, is processed *-1 daily, according to industry data.
For more than the past year, even the rumor of a major West Coast refinery shutdown has been enough *PRO* to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight.
But yesterday, as the morning wore on, some major West Coast refinery operators--including Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of Royal Dutch / Shell Group--said 0 their refineries weren't damaged *-1 and were continuing *-1 to operate normally.
Most said 0 they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a precaution but didn't see any immediate damage.
Gasoline terminals were also largely unhurt, they said 0 *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to imagine how the markets were speculating *T*-3, given that nobody could get through to San Francisco," said *T*-1 one amazed oil company executive.
As the news *ICH*-1 spread that the refineries were intact, crude prices plunged, *PRO*-2 ending the day at $20.56 *U* a barrel, down 19 cents.
Gasoline for November delivery was off 1.26 cents a gallon to 54.58 cents.
Heating oil finished at 60.6 cents, down 0.45 cent.
"The market was basically acting on two contradictory forces," said *T*-1 Nauman Barakat of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
"One is the panic, the earthquake in San Francisco, which *T*-1 is positive."
But once that factor was eliminated *-1, traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventories, Mr. Barakat said 0 *T*-2.
After the market closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute had reported that crude stocks increased by 5.7 million barrels in the week ended Friday, which traders viewed *T*-1 as bearish.
But some market players still think 0 earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets.
"The problem is that while on the surface everything is all right, the question is," said *?* Mr. Barakat, "was there any structural damage to the pipelines or anything else."
In other commodity markets yesterday:
COPPER:
Futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry's labor situation.
The December contract declined 1.85 cents a pound to $1.2645 *U*.
According to one analyst, workers at the Cananea copper mine in Mexico, which *T*-2 hasn't been operating since it was declared *-1 bankrupt by the Mexican government in late August, are set *PRO*-3 to return to work.
The analyst said 0 it will take about two to three months before the mine begins *-1 to produce copper in significant quantities.
He added that, while there hasn't been any official announcement as yet, the Highland Valley mine strike in British Columbia, which *T*-2 has lasted more than three months, is regarded *-1 as *PRO* settled *-3.
Another analyst said 0 the Cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect 0 *?*.
"There are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs, which *T*-1 has been a critical issue all along," he said *T*-2.
Nevertheless, the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved *-1 weighed on the market, the analysts agreed 0 *T*-2.
Both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to Japan, which *T*-1 has been buying copper on the world market.
The first analyst said that the Japanese, as well as the Chinese, bought copper earlier in the week in London, but that this purchasing has since slackened as the supply situation, at least over the long term, appears *-1 to have improved.
"The focus for some time has been on the copper supply, and good demand has been taken *-1 for *PRO* granted *-3," he said *T*-2.
"Now that the supply situation seems *-2 to be improving, it *EXP*-1 would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side."
He noted the Commerce Department report *ICH*-1 yesterday that housing starts in September dropped 5.2% from August to 1.26 million units on an annualized basis, the lowest level in seven years.
"Along with these factors, other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy, which *T*-1 could mean reduced copper usage," he said *T*-2.
SUGAR:
Futures prices extended Tuesday's gains.
The March delivery ended with an advance of 0.16 cent a pound to 14.27 cents, for a two - day gain of 0.3 cent.
According to one dealer, Japan said 0 it has only 40,000 tons of sugar remaining *PRO* to be shipped *-1 to it this year by Cuba under current commitments.
The announcement was made *-1 because of reports *ICH*-2 Tuesday that Cuba would delay shipments to Japan scheduled * for later this year, into early next year.
The dealer said 0 the quantity mentioned * in the Japanese announcement is so small that it's meaningless.
One analyst said 0 he thought 0 the market continued *-2 to be supported *-1 to some degree by a delay in the Cuban sugar harvest caused * by adverse weather.
The dealer said 0 India might be the real factor that *T*-1 is keeping futures prices *PRO*-2 firm.
That country recently bought 200,000 tons of sugar and had been expected *-1 to seek a like quantity last week but didn't *?*.
"It *EXP*-1's known *-2 0 they need the sugar, and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support," the dealer said *T*-3.
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS:
The Agriculture Department is expected *-1 to announce tomorrow that the number of cattle in the 13 major ranch states slipped 4% to 8.21 million on Oct. 1 compared with the level a year earlier, said 0 *T*-2 Tom Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.
Cattle prices have risen in recent weeks on speculation that the government's quarterly report will signal tighter supplies of beef.
Among other things, the government is expected *-1 to report that the number of young cattle placed * on feedlots during the quarter slipped 3%.
Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter, so a drop indicates that the production of beef will dip this winter.
Indeed, some analysts expect the government to report that the movement of young cattle onto feedlots in the month of September in seven big ranch states dropped 8% compared with the level for September 1988.
Within minutes after the stock market closed Friday, I called Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, advised him that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had declined by 190 points late that afternoon, and cheerfully informed him that he and his fellow Democrats were *PRO* to blame *-1.
They had dealt a major setback that afternoon to President Bush's capital - gains tax cut proposal, which *T*-1 had seemed *-2 in the bag after it passed the House overwhelmingly earlier in the month.
Sen. Bradley has it *EXP*-2 in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform 0 he helped engineer *T*-1 in 1986.
But he knows that as many as 20 of his fellow Democrats are disposed *PRO*-1 to vote for the cut, popular among their constituents.
As a result, he took the lead in *PRO* arguing that the cut should be blocked *-1 on procedural grounds.
He helped *PRO*-1 persuade 10 of these senators *PRO*-2 to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds.
The budget reconciliation had *-2 to be dealt with *-1 by the Oct. 15 deadline, and these Senate Democrats refused *PRO*-3 to agree *PRO*-4 to allow a vote 0 *T*-5 to append capital gains to the budget bill, *PRO*-3 knowing 0 it would pass.
*PRO*-1 Denied a vote on substance, the GOP leadership in the Senate on Friday morning was confronted *-1 with a hard choice.
It could throw in the towel and hope *PRO*-2 to win on capital gains late this month, or it could follow the White House strategy, *PRO* to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended *-1.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been in the forefront in *PRO* supporting the Bush proposal.
It endorsed the White House strategy, *PRO*-1 believing it to be the surest way to victory.
At noon Friday, a senior White House official advised Richard Rahn, the Chamber's chief economist, that the White House would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted *-1 in the Senate.
Two hours later, the first word *ICH*-1 emerged on Capitol Hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from Senate Democrats.
Mr. Rahn was shocked, *PRO*-1 telephoning the office of Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the administration's chief strategist on this issue.
He left a message accusing Mr. Darman of *PRO*-1 selling out.
It was the Senate Republicans, though, who *T*-1 had edged away from the veto strategy.
The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did *?*, *PRO*-2 crumbling as it absorbed the news that Mr. Darman's strategy had been abandoned *-1.
The stock market, after all, represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation's capital stock, discounted * to present value.
Why should it *EXP*-1 be so surprising that a 30% cut in the capital - gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation's capital stock *T*-2?
The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $15 trillion *U*.
The value traded * on the exchanges is close to $3 trillion *U*.
If the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled *-1, wouldn't the value fall to the owners of the assets?
Isn't it *EXP*-2 reasonable *PRO* to assume that the asset 0 you own *T*-1 would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it, you would be able *PRO*-3 to keep 30% more of its gain than you previously believed 0 *?*?
Indeed, the stock market's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush's success in *PRO* advancing his capital - gains proposal.
A 30% cut in this year's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $50 billion *U*.
We're talking real money.
When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused *-1 by the setback to capital gains *T*-2, he was generally ignored *-3 and mildly ridiculed *-3.
Instead, the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7% off the value of the nation's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world.
Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea.
Why is this happening *T*-1?
For one thing, quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers, who *T*-2 understand that the value of assets is greatly affected *-1 by how government taxes those assets *T*-3.
They are economists and financial reporters who *T*-1 sympathize with the view that a capital - gains tax cut benefits the rich.
Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to *PRO*-2 losing the tax cut that *T*-1 seemed *-3 so close Friday morning and is now problematic.
The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances *ICH*-2 from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans 0 *PRO* to win the cut, which *T*-1 is alive and well *T*-3.
Sen. Bradley's argument is that a capital - gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run.
It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income - tax rates in 1990 *ICH*-3, he thinks 0 *?*, when the White House is forced *-2 *PRO*-6 to ask for higher taxes 0 *PRO* to meet budget targets *T*-4 *T*-5.
That is, with capital gains cut *-1, the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone, and political realities will push up income - tax rates.
The counter-argument, which he has heard *T*-1, is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in *PRO*-2 killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy.
In this atmosphere, there would be no serious consideration of tax increases.
If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including New Jersey's, would be surprisingly high.
No tax increases would be necessary.
The struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town.
In Washington and on Wall Street.

TRADING VOLUME in Standard & Poor's 500 stock - index futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday totaled 73,803 contracts.
Yesterday's edition incorrectly reported Monday's trading volume as a record for the S&P 500 contract.
Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a U.K. engineering company, reported a 16% jump in pretax profit for the six - month period ending June 30.
Pretax profit rose to #93.2 million *U* ($146.8 million *U*) from #80.6 million *U* ($127 million *U*), *PRO*-2 matching analysts' expectations, which *T*-1 ranged from #90 million *U* to #95 million *U*.

Hawker Siddeley said 0 its core electrical products division enjoyed strong growth, with a 20% rise in operating profit during the period.
Democrat Gene Taylor won a special election 0 *T*-1 to fill the congressional seat vacated * by the death of Republican Larkin Smith, *PRO*-2 taking back the GOP's lone redoubt in Mississippi's House delegation.
Mr. Taylor's overwhelming victory against Republican Tom Anderson reclaims a seat 0 the Republicans had held *T*-1 for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special House elections held * this year.
Mr. Taylor, a 36 - year - old state senator from Bay St. Louis, won 65% of the vote in a district that *PRO*-1 has voted *PRO* Republican in the past five presidential elections and that *T*-2 was once represented *-3 by Republican U.S. Sen. Trent Lott.
Mr. Taylor's victory was an embarrassment for both state and national Republicans.
Mr. Anderson, a former Lott aide, received campaign assistance from the senator and from President Bush, who *T*-1 visited the district last week.
Even so, Mr. Taylor carried all but one of the district's dozen counties.
Rep. Smith died in a plane crash on Aug. 13.
Federal prosecutors said 0 they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry.
William Craig, an independent record promoter, pleaded guilty to payola and criminal tax charges, according to a statement issued * by Gary Feess, the U.S. attorney here.
Payola is the practice of *PRO* making illegal, undisclosed payments to radio station personnel in return for *PRO* getting the stations to play certain songs over the air.
As part of his plea agreement with the government, the 44 - year - old Mr. Craig faces a maximum of three years in prison.
In return, Mr. Craig agreed *PRO*-1 to cooperate in the government's continuing payola probe, says 0 *T*-2 a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
Mr. Craig and three others were indicted *-1 last year as part of that payola probe.
Two other defendants previously pleaded guilty, and charges against the third were dropped *-1.
After *PRO*-1 enduring three days of heavy selling, the beleaguered Nasdaq over - the - counter market finally rebounded, *PRO*-1 rising sharply in hearty trading.
The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.7%, or 3.35, to 463.28.
It rose more than the New York Stock Exchange Composite, which *T*-1 improved 0.2%.
Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1%, or 4.56, to 453.05, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2%.
Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading at PaineWebber, said 0 the OTC market has a habit of *PRO*-1 lagging big moves on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the industrial average rallied on Monday following last Friday's collapse, the OTC market, which *T*-1 didn't suffer too badly during the correction, tumbled.
"Our market got hit a lot harder *ICH*-1 on Monday than the listed market," Mr. Bruno said *T*-2.
"We're just recovering and getting back to business as usual.
I'm encouraged *-1 by the action."
The trading pace was busy, with 4,343 issues and 147.6 million shares changing hands.
Advancing issues beat declining ones, 1,271 to 811.
Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that *T*-2 might be financially affected *-1 by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern California.
As investors speculated about the long - and short - term implications, shares of a number of companies that *T*-2 might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded *-1.
*PRO* Heading the list: insurance, construction and technology companies located * in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Insurance - related stocks were mixed as investors tried *PRO*-1 to figure out how *PRO* to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns *T*-2.
Traders said 0 property - casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the San Francisco area include the OTC's Safeco and Ohio Casualty.
Frank Gilmartin, a trader who *T*-1 follows insurance stocks for Fox - Pitt Kelton, said 0 his strategy was *PRO*-2 to sell early.
Then, if the stocks fell sharply, he planned *PRO*-3 to begin *-4 buying them aggressively, on the theory that the companies that *T*-1 insure against property damage and accidents will have *-5 to raise rates eventually *PRO*-6 to compensate for the claims 0 they will pay *T*-2 to earthquake victims and victims of last month's Hurricane Hugo.
As well, reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits.
Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry, which *T*-2 has been depressed *-1 because of low rates arising from intense competition.
But Mr. Gilmartin said 0 the hurricane damage wasn't extensive enough *PRO* to prompt premium boosts.
"The companies just gave back what they had reserved for *T*-2," he said *T*-1.
"Now, they'll have *-1 to increase their coffers *PRO*-2 to protect for the future and that means rate increases."
Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed.
Safeco fell 1/8 to 32 5/8 on 462,900 shares.
Ohio Casualty rose 1/4 to 51 3/4 on 137,200 shares.
St. Paul Cos. jumped 2 to 59 3/4 on 517,500 shares.

The Nasdaq Insurance Index jumped 4.15 to 529.32 on the day, while the barometer of big insurance and banking issues climbed 1.72 to 455.29.
Investors expect SunGard Data Systems, a company that *T*-1 provides disaster recovery services for computer - dependent businesses, to profit from the earthquake.
SunGard's stock rose 1 3/4 to 21 1/4 on 194,000 shares.
Shares of Kasler, a California road and bridge builder, were heavily traded *-1, *PRO*-1 jumping 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 on 1.3 million shares.
Guy F. Atkinson added 7/8 to 16 7/8, on 335,700 shares.
The company, based * in San Francisco, provides industrial infrastructure engineering and construction services.
Traders were initially nervous about shares of companies, including many leading OTC computer companies, such as Apple Computer with offices in the vicinity of the area damaged * by the quake.
But most of those stocks fared well.
Apple Computer gained 1 to 48 1/4; Ashton - Tate rose 3/8 to 10 3/8.
Intel also added 3/8 to 33 7/8.
But Sun Microsystems slipped 1/4 to 17 1/4.
Shares of biotechnology companies in the area were also higher.
Chiron was up 1/2 to 27 and Cetus gained 1/2 to 16 3/8.
The stocks of computer - related companies located * outside California improved, too.
Microsoft advanced 1 7/8 to 80 1/2 and Lotus Development added 1 1/4 to 32 1/2.
In other earthquake - related news, Hambrecht & Quist's OTC market makers were excused *-1 from trading yesterday and its positions were frozen *-2 for the day by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Power couldn't be restored *-1 at the company's San Francisco headquarters *PRO* to allow trading yesterday morning.
In New York, Roger Killion, a Hambrecht executive vice president, said 0 he expects OTC trading at the company to resume this morning, either in New York or in San Francisco.
In other trading, Medco Containment Services gained 7/8 to 15 on 1.9 million shares after *PRO*-2 reporting a loss for the first quarter, which *T*-1 ended Sept. 30.
The company earned $6.6 million *U* in the year - earlier quarter.
Jaguar's American depositary receipts added 3/8 to 10 3/4 on volume of 1.1 million.
Analysts in London believe 0 investors, despite their stampede *PRO* to dump takeover stocks, should hold on tight to their Jaguar shares, this newspaper's Heard * on the Street column said 0 *T*-1 yesterday.
Amgen rose 1 1/2 to 50 3/4 in heavy trading.
Analysts figure 0 Amgen could benefit as a result of troubles facing its competitor, Genetics Institute, over the anti-anemia drug EPO.
Genetics Institute disclosed recently that it is embroiled *-1 in a dispute with Boehringer Mannheim, which *T*-2 distributes the drug, regarding the usability of some batches.
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission Wednesday cleared Rhone - Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of a specialty bulk - chemical unit from Monsanto Co., *PRO*-1 saying 0 the purchase was unlikely *-2 to have any lasting impact on U.K. industrial consumers.
The commission, which *T*-1 was asked *-3 *-4 *PRO*-5 to study the deal by the Department of Trade and Industry after its announcement in February, said 0 the diversity of global supply of chemicals used * in *PRO* making analgesic drugs was great enough *PRO* to offset the dominant U.K. market share 0 Rhone - Poulenc would gain *T*-2 through the acquisition.
The French chemical giant would hold an 80% share of the U.K. market for salicylic acid, methyl salicylate and bulk aspirin.
The commission found that if the British government attempted *PRO*-2 to block the merger, Rhone - Poulenc would likely respond by *PRO*-3 closing the salicylates plant 0 Monsanto operates *T*-1 in Wales, *PRO*-3 removing the matter from U.K. jurisdiction.
Italy's wholesale price index rose 0.4% in August from July and was up 6.1% from a year earlier, the state statistical institute reported 0 *T*-1.
The index registered 196.1 in August, compared with 195.4 in July and with 184.9 in August 1988.
The year - on - year rise in August was slightly down from the 6.4% rate in July.
The index has a base of 100 set * in 1980 and isn't seasonally adjusted *-1.
Dale Lang, who this week *T*-2 completed the acquisition of the publisher of Ms. and Sassy, is candid about the challenge 0 he is taking *T*-1 on.
Mr. Lang admits that Ms. is "in dire straits" and that Sassy needs big promotional dollars 0 *T*-1 to keep it *PRO*-2 alive.
But the 57 - year - old publisher has moved quickly and boldly *PRO*-1 to deal with the magazines' problems.
Last Friday, he told the staff of Ms. that the magazine in January would begin *-1 publishing without advertising.
Mr. Lang will do away with expensive circulation drives, *PRO* not to mention sales staff, and attempt *PRO*-1 to publish the 17 - year - old magazine *PRO*-3 supported *-2 by circulation revenue alone.
"Any fool can publish a money - losing magazine.
I want *PRO*-2 to publish one that *T*-1 succeeds," said *T*-3 Mr. Lang.
"For Ms., it's time 0 *PRO* to publish for the reader, not the advertiser *T*-1."
As for Sassy, which *T*-1 competes directly with News Corp.'s Seventeen magazine, Mr. Lang says that in the next two years he will spend $6 million *U* *PRO*-2 promoting and improving the magazine.
Though Sassy has grown quickly since its debut in March 1988, it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and skittish advertisers who *T*-1 bristled at its frank editorial matter on teen - age problems.
Mr. Lang said 0 the former Australian owners of Sassy were "blind - sided *-1 by the Moral Majority....
Their reaction was *PRO*-1 to do nothing and ride it out."
He said 0 Sassy will keep its irreverent tone, but added, "We will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine."
Sassy already has recovered; circulation has quickly passed the 500,000 mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than 300.
What *T*-1's more, Mr. Lang says 0 he has what all publishers wish for *T*-2: a bona fide niche.
"Seventeen is written *-2 more for mothers, not their daughters," said *T*-1 Mr. Lang.
"But Sassy has a different spirit.
It gets more mail *ICH*-1 in a month than McCall's got *?* in a year, and it's not from mothers.
I feel about Sassy like I did *?* about Working Woman 10 years ago."
Mr. Lang took on Ms. and Sassy with the acquisition of Matilda Publications Inc. by his newly formed Lang Communications.
Lang owns 70% of Matilda, while Citicorp owns the rest through its Citicorp Venture Capital Partners.
Two weeks ago, Citicorp and Mr. Lang pumped $800,000 *U* into Matilda just *PRO*-1 to keep the doors *PRO*-2 open.
Industry observers have congratulated Mr. Lang on what some call *T*-1 *PRO*-2 his "courageous" handling of Ms., but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews.
Besides Ms. and Sassy, closely held Lang Communications includes Success, a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses, and Working Woman and Working Mother, two monthly magazines.
Working Woman, with circulation near one million, and Working Mother, with 625,000 circulation, are legitimate magazine success stories.
The magazine Success, however, was for years lackluster and unfocused.
Only recently has it been attractively redesigned *-1 and its editorial product improved *-2.
Success is expected *-1 to gain at least because of the recent folding of rival Venture, another magazine for growing companies.
Working Woman and Working Mother have operated as part of Working Woman / McCall's Group, a less - than - successful joint venture between Mr. Lang and Time Warner Inc.
The joint venture is being undone *-1, with McCall's magazine being sold *-2 last summer to the New York Times Co.'s Magazine Group for about $80 million *U*, and Time Warner agreeing *PRO*-3 to sell back its 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother to Mr. Lang.
Executives at Time Inc . Magazine Co., a subsidiary of Time Warner, have said 0 the joint venture with Mr. Lang wasn't a good one.
The venture, formed * in 1986, was supposed *-1 to be Time's low - cost, safe entry into women's magazines.
Mr. Lang surprised Time soon after *PRO* joining forces when he said 0 he would negotiate rates individually with advertisers, a practice common in broadcasting but considered *PRO* taboo by magazine publishers *T*-1.
In addition, McCall's put in a less than stellar performance.
Until a recent comeback, it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation.
Time executives complained about the shoddy editorial quality, and in the end, one Time executive who *T*-1 asked *PRO*-3 not to be identified *-2 said, "Frankly, McCall's and the joint venture were an embarrassment."
Mr. Lang feels that Time's priorities changed.
"Their management changed right after {the venture was formed *-1}, and I don't think 0 they were comfortable *PRO*-2 getting into the competitive wars of women's service magazines."
Today, Mr. Lang believes 0 his magazines will offer what many women's magazines don't *?* *T*-1.
"We write straight for women on their level," he said *T*-1.
"We don't have passive readers."
Mr. Lang points out that even Success, in part, fits the company's image, since about 30% of its readership is female.
Mr. Lang has named Carol Taber, 43, as group publisher of New York - based Lang Communications.
She will oversee Working Woman, Working Mother and Success magazines, and retain her post as publisher of Working Woman.
The sale price of McCall's--twice what Mr. Lang originally paid *T*-1 for it--will finance Lang Communications' buy - back of Time Warner's 50% interest in Working Woman and Working Mother.
Mr. Lang says 0 he isn't scouting new acquisitions, at least for now.
"We would have *-2 to go outside to banks *PRO*-2 to get the money and I am not ready *PRO*-3 to do that," he said *T*-1.
"Besides, we have enough on our plate.
There is plenty of work 0 *T*-3 to be done *-1 on what we have *T*-2.
Beazer PLC, a major British building materials and construction concern, reported a 24% jump in pretax profit for its latest financial year, *PRO*-1 helped *-2 largely by contributions from its U.S. unit, Koppers Co.
Pretax profit for the year to June 30 rose to #142.5 million *U* ($224.5 million *U*) from #114.7 million *U* ($180.7 million *U*), *PRO*-1 broadly matching analysts' expectations.
Profit after taxes and minority interests but before extraordinary items increased 22% to #92.6 million *U* from #75.6 million *U* a year earlier, while fully diluted earnings per share rose to 29.90 pence (47 cents) from 24.68 pence (39 cents).
Northern Trust Corp. said 0 its board adopted a shareholder rights plan aimed * at *PRO* deterring unwanted takeover bids, but said 0 it's not aware of any plan *PRO* to acquire the banking concern.
Under Northern Trust's plan, shareholders were issued *-1 rights that, in the event of certain attempted takeovers, *T*-2 allow holders to buy shares in the company at half price.
In August, soon after Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a staggering $424.3 million *U* loss and replaced its president, two Boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying: "We fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the ` Amazing Comeback at Wang."'
How soon Wang will stage a comeback *T*-1, or if it will *?* at all, are still matters of debate.
But Wang salespeople are trying *PRO*-3 to cope with the biggest challenge 0 any marketer can face *T*-2: *PRO* selling the products of a company that *T*-1 is on the ropes.
"If your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you're not feeling as if you're backed *-3 up by a stable company, you've lost it before you've begun," says *T*-2 Mary Ann Cluggish, a Wellesley, Mass., sales trainer and consultant who *T*-1 works with high technology companies.
It can happen in any industry.
*PRO* Consider the difficulties faced * by Audi salespeople when the car was tainted *-1 by false charges of sudden acceleration *T*-2, or Exxon dealers' problems in the wake of the Valdez oil spill.
Like thousands of salespeople before them, Wang's are finding ways 0 *PRO* to combat the bad news *T*-1.
"It *EXP*-1's very important that we exude confidence, even though within the family we know 0 there's a lot of hard work ahead," said *T*-2 Richard Miller, the Lowell, Mass., computer concern's new president, in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over.
Wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts.
Its mainline minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers.
Last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing, and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising *T*-1.
After the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter, Wang's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as "How could you not have known 0 you were going *-1 to lose $55 million *U* *T*-3?" and "Is *ICH*-2 Wang still a viable company?"
Salespeople try *PRO*-1 to push their products and avoid discussions of finances.
*PRO* Responding to such questions is "defensive," says *T*-1 Kenneth Olissa, Wang's vice president, marketing.
"That's antithetical to the art of selling."
Moreover, he notes that *PRO* analyzing financial results "poses a problem for a salesman who *T*-1 isn't particularly familiar with a balance sheet."
At one sales strategy meeting, an executive suggested *PRO* ordering salespeople *PRO*-1 to become experts on the annual report.
Mr. Miller vetoed that: "Even I can't understand all the footnotes," he says *T*-1.
Instead, he says 0 *?*, if the salespeople can get the customers to consider Wang's products on their merits, he or a top financial officer will try *PRO*-2 to assuage the fears about finances.
Mike Metschan, a salesman in Wang's Austin, Texas, office, has a breezier method: "We tell them 0 $3 billion *U* companies don't go out of business.
We tell them 0 all the major companies are having financial difficulties."
Numerous computer companies are having sales slumps and earnings declines, but very few have had losses comparable to Wang's or are carrying such a large debt load.
Mr. Miller says that after a sharp sales slump in July and August, sales stabilized in September.
Although Wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended Sept. 30 and the full fiscal year, Mr. Miller says 0 he expects 0 the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter.
Experts on sales technique say 0 anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line.
"If a salesman jeopardizes his credibility in this time of trouble, it will be a problem for the long run," says *T*-1 George Palmatier, a Minden, Nev., sales consultant and author of "The Marketing Edge."
Still, says John Sullivan, a management recruiter with Daniel Roberts Inc. of Boston, who *T*-1 has held senior sales positions at Polaroid and Atari: "The customer will react to strength.
*PRO* Ignore the present condition.
*PRO* Show 0 it's business as usual."
That isn't easy.
Wang's customers are data processing managers who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to be sure that their suppliers are stable, wellrun companies that *T*-2 will be around *PRO*-4 to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years 0 *T*-5 to come.
For buyers, "these are career - risking decisions," says 0 *T*-2 Jean Conlin, who *T*-1 supervises a network of Wang computers in the admissions department at Boston University.
The university is considering *PRO*-1 installing a $250,000 *U* system 0 *T*-2 to store applications electronically.
"Before the really bad news, we were looking at Wang fairly seriously," she says *T*-1.
But "their present financial condition means 0 I'd have a hard time *PRO*-1 convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing."
Ms. Conlin adds: "At some point we'd have *-1 to ask, ` How do we know that in three years you won't be in Chapter 11 *T*-2?"'
During the past year, Wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president.
Wang's overall product line is "still not as good as other vendors, but they've come a long way," says 0 *T*-1 Steven Wendler, a consultant with market researcher Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn.
"They were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened."
The first priority for Wang's sales force is *PRO* to make sure 0 it holds on to existing customers.
Wang's installed base is one of its greatest assets, and many of those customers remain extremely loyal.
But even before Wang's latest financial troubles surfaced, some customers "were trying *PRO*-2 to wall off their Wang installations" so other departments wouldn't add Wang, says 0 *T*-3 Chris Christiansen, a former Wang marketer who *T*-1 is now a market analyst with Meta Group, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.
One Wang salesman who *T*-1 left the company in July recalls that when he tried *PRO*-2 to sell products to Eastman Kodak *T*-3, he worked "*PRO*-4 to muster support from internal allies," but "those allies became skeptical as they saw the downtrend.
The more recent losses were really devastating."
New customers, the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to Wang's long - term viability, are even tougher.
Rick Lynch, a former top salesman in Wang's Boston office, *PRO*-1 referring to Wang's mainstay computer line, says: "You can't sell a VS to a new customer."
Mr. Lynch left Wang this summer for Oracle Systems Inc., a software vendor.
The financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing Wang's image systems, which *T*-1 convert paper forms to electronic documents.
Consultants say that Wang's technology is among the best available in the image market.
But salespeople often found that news of Wang's problems superseded their sales efforts.
William Tait, a former sales manager in Indianapolis, says that his office had all but sold a $1.5 million *U* image system to pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly & Co.
"When they were making the decision *T*-1, all hell broke loose with the finances."
He says 0 the Lilly executives told him 0 they couldn't take the risk with Wang.
Mr. Tait say 0 he doesn't blame Lilly.
Buyers have *-1 to rely on a supplier "continually upgrading and replacing the product," he says 0 *T*-2.
"When a company realizes that *T*-2, it *EXP*-1's hard *PRO* to go with Wang."
For Mr. Tait, who *T*-1 says 0 he used *-2 to earn as much as $150,000 *U* a year at Wang, it was one more reason 0 *PRO* to quit *T*-3.
He is now president of Eastate Homes Inc., an Indianapolis contractor.
It *EXP*-1 can be hard for a salesperson to fight off feelings of discouragement.
Brian Petre, a former Wang salesman in upstate New York, says: "You have pride in your job.
You think 0 you can go out and turn things around.
It *EXP*-2's a tough thing when you can't *?* *T*-1.
The reason doesn't relate to your selling skills."
Discouragement feeds on itself.
"The problem is, if people get down in the dumps, they stop *-2 selling," says *T*-1 Mike Durcan, a laid - off sales manager in Wang's Austin office.
One key for salespeople is *PRO* to boost their own morale.
Paul Hellman, a Framingham, Mass., sales and management consultant and author of "*PRO* Ready, *PRO* Aim, You're Hired *-2," says: "The bad news is, you'll be rejected *-1 more.
The good news is, it's not your fault."
So, he advises 0 *?*, *PRO* make goals achievable.
For instance, he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves: "All 0 I want *PRO* to do *T*-1 today is get 50 rejections."
But Mr. Miller, Wang's new president, recently warned his salespeople about negativism.
"Our customers watch us for the hidden message," he said *T*-1.
"*PRO* Look a customer right in the eye and say, ` I'm glad *PRO*-1 to be at Wang.

A new drug 0 *T*-2 to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used *-1 on more than 100 patients at the University of Pittsburgh, according to researchers.
The drug, which *T*-2 is still in the experimental phase, hasn't been approved *-1 yet by the Food and Drug Admistration, and its long - term effects are unknown.
But researchers say 0 the drug, called *PRO* *PRO*-507 FK - 506, could revolutionize the transplantation field by *PRO* reducing harmful side effects and by *PRO* lowering rejection rates.
Rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants performed * world - wide each year.
Researchers began *-2 using the drug *ICH*-3 in February on patients who *T*-1 had received kidney, liver, heart and pancreas transplants.
Only two of 111 transplants have been rejected *-1.
The drug, discovered * in 1984, is metabolized *-1 from soil fungus found * in Japan.
The Pittsburgh patients are the first humans 0 *T*-4 to be given *-1 the drug, which *T*-3 is made *-2 by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co.
"We're shocked by it, because it's worked so fast," said *T*-1 Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program, at a news conference here yesterday.
"We consider it a life - saving drug, like one for AIDS," said *T*-1 Dr. John Fung, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh.
Researchers say 0 they believe 0 FK - 506 is 100 times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug, cyclosporine, made * by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Sandoz Ltd.
They are also encouraged *-1 by the relatively mild side effects of FK - 506, compared with cyclosporine, which *T*-507 can cause renal failure, morbidity, nausea and other problems.
"The side effects {of cyclosporine} have made the penalty for its success rather high," Dr. Starzl said *T*-1.
Dr. Fung said that FK - 506 would not be available in the market for at least a year, and that the FDA approval process usually takes three years to five years.
There are no firm plans *PRO* to expand the experimental program beyond the University of Pittsburgh, whose hospital *T*-1 performs the most transplants in the world.
Researchers couldn't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market *T*-1, but they said 0 FK - 506 will enable patients *PRO*-507 to cut hospital stays by 50% and reduce the number of blood tests used * *PRO* to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients.
Dr. Starzl said 0 the research has been largely financed *-1 by the National Institute of Health and by university funds, and that Fujisawa didn't give the hospital any grants.
He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug.
"We've known for six months the effect of this drug, and our advice to our people has been *PRO* not to buy the company's stock," Dr. Starzl said *T*-2, *PRO*-1 adding that *PRO* profiting from FK - 506 wouldn't be ethical.
Coca - Cola Co. may be about *-1 to intensify the cola wars.
Coke said 0 it will test market a caffeine - free version of its flagship brand, Coca - Cola Classic, beginning next week in Charlotte, N.C.
Other, as yet unnamed, cities will follow.
If all goes well, the product will be rolled *-1 out for national sales sometime next year, a Coke spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
After the confusion surrounding the change of the Coke formula in 1985, Coca - Cola was reluctant *PRO*-1 to clutter the Classic name with a brand extension.
But now, the soft - drink giant appears *-1 willing *PRO*-2 to take the risk.
"The name Classic Coke has tremendous value, and they haven't merchandised that name before," says *T*-1 Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest.
The Coke spokesman said 0 a caffeine - free Classic should help *PRO*-1 increase volume of the original brand.
Indeed, analysts have said that the absence of new products, among other factors, has limited sales growth throughout the industry.
Coke now leads Pepsi in market share in caffeine - free diet colas but trails Pepsi in sales of caffeine - free sugared colas, according to Beverage Digest.
Coke introduced a caffeine - free sugared cola based on its original formula in 1983.
It switched to a caffeine - free formula using its new Coke in 1985.
Coke has been studying the possibility of *PRO*-1 introducing a caffeine - free Classic for a year, a company spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
He said 0 large increases in sales of other non-caffeine soft drinks make the timing right now.
Could the collapse of I - 880 have been prevented *-1?
That was the question 0 structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves *T*-2 yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of *PRO*-3 trying *PRO*-4 to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double - deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that *T*-1 caved in during Tuesday's temblor.
After *PRO*-1 touring the area, California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway's collapse, *PRO*-1 blaming the disaster on substandard construction, the Associated Press reported 0 *T*-2.
The impact of the destruction of this 2.5 - mile stretch of highway was tragically measured *-1 in lost lives.
But there are other long - term effects that *T*-1 raise serious questions about the ability *ICH*-2 of California's infrastructure *PRO* to withstand a major temblor.
It *EXP*-3 could easily be two years before the well - traveled artery that *T*-2 helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened *-1, and the cost *PRO* to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million *U*, said 0 *T*-4 Charles J. O'Connell, deputy district director in Los Angeles of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed *PRO* *PRO*-5 Caltrans.
Caltrans in Sacramento said 0 total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated *-1 at around $500 million *U*.
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well, as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans *PRO* to bring double - decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994.
Caltrans plans *PRO* to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a 2.5 - mile stretch of the Harbor Freeway just south of Los Angeles, near the Memorial Coliseum.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn yesterday vowed *PRO*-1 to fight the introduction of double - decking in the area.
Caltrans abandoned double - decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that *T*-1 destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained 0 *T*-2.
That temblor measured 6.1 on the Richter scale; Tuesday's was
So why *PRO* even consider *PRO*-1 stacking freeways now *T*-2?
"We've run out of places 0 *PRO* to build freeways *T*-1 in L.A., and the only place 0 *PRO* to go *T*-3 is up," Mr. O'Connell said *T*-2, although he acknowledges 0 there are many obstacles, including cost.
But as for safety, he says 0 double - deck freeways built * today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required * after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale.
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday.
But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that *T*-1 supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake.
The two - story roadway, designed * in the mid-1940s and completed * in 1957, was supported *-1 by columns that *T*-2 apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used * in highways today.
While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that *T*-1 run horizontally through the column, said 0 *T*-2 Leo Parker, a structural engineer in Los Angeles.
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design 0 Mr. Parker describes *T*-1, with spiraling steel rods inside.
But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, *PRO* crushing motorists who *T*-1 were lined *-2 up in bumper - to - bumper rush - hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below.
Officials of the state agency didn't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement didn't hold up *T*-1.
Caltrans reinforced the highway in 1977 as part of a $55 million *U* statewide project, *PRO*-1 using steel cables *PRO*-2 to tie the decks of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from *PRO*-3 swaying in a quake.
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago in Sacramento declined *PRO*-2 to identify the engineering firm that *T*-1 did the reinforcement work.
Liability in the bridge and road collapses will revolve around whether government took "reasonable care" *PRO* to build and maintain the structures, says 0 *T*-2 John Messina, a Tacoma, Wash., personal - injury attorney who *T*-1 specializes in highway design and maintenance cases.
The firm brought * in *PRO*-1 to strengthen the structure could be liable as well.
The results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken *-1, Mr. Messina says 0 *T*-2.
Given the seismic history of the Bay Area, "it seems to me that a 6.9 earthquake is a foreseeable event."
Caltrans' Mr. Drago defended the agency's work on the Nimitz Freeway.
"The work was done *-2 properly," he said *T*-1.
"Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something 0 the structure couldn't withstand *T*-1."
Ironically, Caltrans this year began *-1 working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, *PRO*-1 this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" *PRO*-2 to reinforce them.
But only bridges supported * with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported * by double rows, was left *-2 out, Mr. Drago explained 0 *T*-1.
"The reason is that the technology is such that we're not able *PRO*-2 to retrofit multi-column structures," he said *T*-1.

"The New Crowd" by Judith Ramsey Ehrlich and Barry J. Rehfeld (Little, Brown, 444 pages, $19.95 *U*), describes the displacing of the old "our crowd" Jewish Wall Street banking grandees by such new business barons as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn, Sanford Weill and Bruce Wasserstein.
Its many lively stories include the Gutfreund - Postel holiday cheer imbroglio.
These two New Crowd families lived in the same apartment building, with the Postel penthouse perched * on top of the Gutfreund duplex.
The penthouse elevator started up from the Gutfreund landing, and Susan Gutfreund used *-1 to turn off its light, *PRO*-1 to give the impression that there was no higher floor.
Eventually, Mr. Postel broke his toe in the dark.
Then the Gutfreunds determined *PRO*-1 to put up a 22 - foot Christmas tree, weighing a quarter of a ton, *PRO*-2 to amaze their holiday guests.
For this, a crane needed *-2 to be mounted *-1 on the Postels' terrace.
The Postels did not give permission.
But the Gutfreund workers went ahead anyway, *PRO*-2 only to be captured *-3 "in flagrante" by Joan Postel, who *T*-1 called the police.
Before the Gutfreunds finally left this unfriendly environment for a prodigious duplex on Fifth Avenue and an 18th - century mansion with a specially excavated $1 million *U* garage in Paris, the Postels had obtained an injunction 0 *T*-1 to prevent any future hoisting of trees, and in a neighborly spirit hit both the Gutfreunds and the building with a $35 million *U* lawsuit.
Nothing less, it seemed 0 *?*, could console them for their traumas.
Where had all the money come from *T*-1?
The young John Gutfreund had been discovered *-2 by Billy Salomon of Salomon Bros. when he was still a bearded liberal *T*-1, and put *PRO*-2 to work as a trader, and then as a rough - and - tumble syndicator.
"` *PRO* Get off your...,' he would bellow *T*-2," say *T*-1 the authors.
*PRO*-1 Rising in the firm, he became powerful and bland, though his new wife, Susan, made him shine in the gossip columns with her profligate spending habits and flamboyant frocks.
After he had been head of the company for 3 1/2 years, he and his partners sold it to Phibro, a powerful commodity trading outfit, for $550 million *U* in Phibro stock.
Limited partner Billy Salomon, whose family name *T*-1 had been on the firm's door for 70 years and who *T*-2 had hoped 0 it would be there forever, was not consulted *-3.
Mr. Gutfreund collected $32 million *U*, while Billy Salomon got $10 million *U*, much less than if he had conducted the sale.
"I felt betrayed," he later said *T*-1.
Worse, Salomon's timing had been off.
Its profits, unlike Phibro's, soared over the next two years, and had it held out, Salomon could have gotten an even bigger bundle.
The book also recounts the not dissimilar maneuvers surrounding the changing of the guard at Lehman Bros. and other grand old firms.
Often the genteel, conservative, long - term - oriented investment bankers were displaced *-1 by crude traders: "When *PRO* angered *-2 *T*-3, he cursed so forcefully that his face reddened and his pale - blue eyes narrowed into tiny slits," the authors say *T*-4 of Lehman's Lewis Glucksman.
The earlier generation of "our crowd" bankers--Belmonts, Warburgs, Lehmans, Baches and Schiffs--had stressed above all probity, tradition, continuity and reputation.
They were old - fashioned elegant gentlemen, who *T*-1 happened *-2 to be of German Jewish extraction.
But in the harsh world of today's Wall Street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less scrupulous successors.
The cuckoo prefers the nests of other birds and heaves out their eggs.
But the old guard hired the New Crowd people: It brought in its own cuckoos.
So, as the Old Crowd toppled from the branch, it shouldn't have been too surprised.
The old guard had every right *ICH*-1, however, *PRO* to disdain the newcomers' new ways of *PRO* making money, such as greenmail.
(A Fortune article on Saul Steinberg was entitled *-1, "*PRO*-2 Fear and Loathing in the Corporate Boardrooms.")
Their other staple has been corporate takeovers, often hostile and financed * by junk bonds.
Hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon.
Sometimes they are constructive, but often not.
First, by *PRO*-1 making management focus on short - term results, they inhibit *PRO* building for the future--just the opposite of Japan.
Second, a long - term shareholder of a good company needn't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily *T*-1: It will bounce back.
But if a raider takes over when the stock is weak *T*-1, the shareholder never gets his recovery.
The raiders, meanwhile, have evolved their own pattern for *PRO* spending their new millions.
As *PRO* described *-1 in "The New Crowd," they take on ambitious new wives, move to Greenwich, Conn., or Bedford, N.Y., buy OK pictures, and let their wives share the wealth with decorators.
*PRO*-1 Having donated heavily to museums, they demand a place on their boards.
The book is patronizing about this nouveau riche struggle for respectability, which *T*-1 has its tawdry aspects.
However, on balance, the charity game helps America.
If those who *T*-1 have the money don't get involved with the museums and the charities, then City Hall will do it, badly.
It *EXP*-2 has been rightly observed *-1 that the main thing wrong with tainted money is, 0 t' ai nt enough of it.
A handful of the New Crowd operators have crossed the line from the immoral to the illegal, and have ended up in the slammer or *PRO*-2 paying huge fines:
Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine, Martin Siegel, Victor and Steven Posner, and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley.
The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated *T*-1 for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and "Pinky" Green, today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences.
The Old Crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this.
However, the phenomenon is not specifically Jewish.
It *EXP*-2 has always been true that those outside the club want *PRO*-1 to climb in, and that a few will cut corners in the process.
Some pretty seamy stuff built the turn - of - the - century families' Fifth Avenue and Newport palazzi and endowed their daughters' weddings to foreign noblemen.
Mr. Boesky was a piker compared to Jay Gould and Jim Fiske, and Commodore Vanderbilt thought nothing of *PRO*-1 bribing judges and legislators.
So who *T*-1 knows?
In a generation or two some of the New Crowd may attain true respectability, *PRO*-1 perhaps to be displaced *-2 in turn by a later flock of unscrupulous raptors.
Or perhaps Wall Street, when it has suffered enough *T*-1, will realize that finance is a service industry, and change its ethos.

Great American Bank said 0 its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank *PRO*-1 to pursue nontraditional banking activities under a new federal law.
The proposed holding company's primary purpose would be *PRO*-1 to allow Great American to continue *-2 engaging in real estate development activities, it said 0 *T*-3.
Those activities generated $26.1 million *U* in operating profit last year.
But according to Great American, such profits don't count toward *PRO* meeting the San Diego savings bank's new capitalization requirements under 1989 federal law.
The new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure *PRO*-1 to comply with the law.
The proposed holding company would also consolidate Great American Bank in San Diego and its Tucson, Ariz., savings bank into a single, federally chartered institution in San Diego.
The consolidation is expected *-1 to save $1 million *U* a year in administrative costs, a Great American spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
The Tennessee Valley Authority issued $4 billion *U* in bonds in the federal utility's first public debt offering in 15 years.
Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used *-1 *PRO* to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%.
The TVA said 0 the refinancing should save $75 million *U* a year in interest payments.
The refinancing is part of the TVA's strategy of *PRO* dealing with what *T*-2 has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion *U* debt, most of which *T*-3 is owed *-1 to the Treasury Department's Federal Financing Bank.
The TVA currently plans *PRO*-1 to issue a total of $6.7 billion *U* in bonds *PRO*-2 to refinance its high - interest debt.
The $4 billion *U* bond issue also will help the TVA meet its goal of *PRO*-1 not raising rates for another year, said 0 *T*-2 William F. Malec, the agency's chief financial officer.
The bond issue is TVA's first public offering since the Financing Bank was created *-1 in 1974, *PRO* primarily to finance the TVA.
But the offering almost didn't happen.
The TVA, in fact, decided *PRO*-2 to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the Financing Bank, which *T*-1 allows TVA to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market.
The Treasury contended that TVA couldn't borrow from both it and the public debt market.
The $4 billion *U* in bonds break down as *PRO* follows: $1 billion *U* in five - year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25% and a yield to maturity of 8.33%; $1 billion *U* in 10 - year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375% and a yield to maturity of 8.42%; $2 billion *U* in 30 - year bonds with five - year call protection, a coupon rate of 8.75% and a yield to maturity of 9.06%.
Managing the bond issue is *T*-1 a group of investment banks headed * by First Boston Corp. and co-managed * by Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley & Co., and Salomon Brothers Inc.
The White House is making sure 0 nobody will accuse it of *PRO*-1 taking this crisis lightly.
In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake - related activity yesterday morning.
Some of it was necessary *PRO* to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed *-1 mostly *PRO*-2 to project an image of a White House in action.
Mr. Bush and his aides were accused *-1 of *PRO*-2 responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly don't want a repeat of those charges now.
So the White House announced that Mr. Bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at 6:30 a.m. from chief of staff John Sununu.
By noon, Mr. Bush had taken two phone calls from Vice President Dan Quayle, who *T*-1 was in California; made a televised statement of concern; signed a disaster proclamation; received a written report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and visited FEMA headquarters.
Mr. Bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying *PRO*-1 to head off criticism.
On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped 0 there would be "less carping" about the emergency office's performance this time, *PRO*-1 adding that the agency "took a hit" for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
He visited the Hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him *PRO*-1 to do so.
I approached "Mastergate," Larry Gelbart's new comedy at the Criterion Center, with considerable trepidation.
Nothing, I assumed 0 *?*, would be more hopelessly dated than a political satire on the Iran - Contra affair.
I had underestimated, however, both Mr. Gelbart's wit and the persistence of scandal in Washington.
Though the play clearly is framed *-1 around the events of Iran - Contra, it takes in the wide sweep of scandals over the past 30 years.
In fact, at one point Merry Chase (Melinda Mullins), a cool, carefully coiffed television announcer, recites a list of a dozen or more scandals of recent years, *PRO*-1 concluding with those affecting the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the savings and loan industry.
Onstage, a congressional hearing *ICH*-1 is in progress, complete with elegant crystal chandelier overhead and a lifesize reproduction of the signing of the Constitution in the background.
The witness table is center stage and below it, the paraphernalia for the ever - present media, in this case TNN, the Total News Network.
Not only are there camera operators on all sides, but the proceedings are shown *-1 on monitors throughout the theater.
The metaphor of theater is not entirely coincidental.
Mr. Gelbart clearly feels that all the participants in a congressional hearing--the witnesses, the lawyers, the interrogators and the news media--are performers.
As the story of "Mastergate" unfolds, we learn that the Internal Revenue Service confiscated one of the properties of a foreign financier who *T*-1 owes the government millions in taxes.
The man, it seems 0 *?*, has a Lichtenstein corporation, licensed * in Libya and sheltered * in the Bahamas.
He himself lives in a "consecutive series of unnumbered houses in a town in Switzerland."
The property seized * by the IRS is a Hollywood film studio, Master Pictures Incorporated (MPI).
Supposedly the IRS will sell off the assets of MPI, but before it can *?*, a lowly IRS agent is called *-1 into the hospital room of Wylie Slaughter, the dying head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
The lowly agent, Abel Lamb, who as you might guess 0 *?*, *T*-2 is being led *-1 to the slaughter, is ordered *-3 *PRO*-4 to take over the studio.
Soon the studio is producing a $40 million *U* picture called * *PRO*-1 "Tet, the Motion Picture," *PRO* to distinguish it from "Tet, the Offensive," as well as "Tet, the Book" and "Tet, the Album."
The picture, 0 *T*-4 to be made *-1 in the Central American country of San Elvador, is a cover for *PRO* sending $800 million *U* of arms to Los Otros, the rebel group attempting *PRO* to regain neighboring Ambigua, which *T*-2 has been taken *-5 over by the leftist dictator Dr. Overtega, a former podiatrist, who *T*-3 leads a revolutionary band of foot soldiers.
The man handling all this for the now - deceased Slaughter is Major Manley Battle, Mr. Gelbart's stand in for Col. Oliver North.
Director Michael Engler has assembled a top - flight cast 0 *T*-2 to carry out the impersonations of well - known political figures and to play the stock characters who *T*-1 invariably show up at congressional hearings.
Daniel von Bargen is ramrod - stiff but totally assured as Major Battle, *PRO*-2 mixing just the right brand of self - righteousness and patriotism; Jeff Weiss is fire, brimstone and teary - eyed emotionalism as the far - right senator who *T*-1 serves as a friendly interrogator of Major Battle; Zach Grenier is maddeningly officious *PRO*-3 playing a succession of lawyers; Joseph Daly has the perfect "aw, shucks" demeanor of George Bush in his portrayal of the vice president; and Ann McDonough is first - rate as a succession of witnesses' wives.
With one she is pregnant, with Major Battle she is knitting an American flag, and as the vice president's wife she rushes in with white hair, *PRO*-1 wearing a tailored suit and pearls, *PRO*-1 imitating Barbara Bush's gestures down to the last detail.
Though it *EXP*-1's clear that Mr. Gelbart's sympathies do not lie with the far right, it *EXP*-2's also true that he is evenhanded in *PRO*-3 dispensing his satirical jabs, *PRO*-3 taking sharp aim at senators and congressmen of all stripes and particularly at the media.
Mr. Gelbart also has fun with language.
"Mastergate" is subtitled *-1 *PRO*-2 "a play on words," and Mr. Gelbart plays that game as well as anyone.
He describes a Mastergate flunky as one who *T*-1 experienced a "meteoric disappearance" and found himself "handling blanket appeals at the Bureau of Indian Affairs."
This interest in words goes beyond puns and playfulness, however.
Mr. Gelbart deplores the obfuscation, the circumlocution and the debasement of language 0 he sees *T*-1 on all sides.
As the hearings begin, the self - important Sen. Bowman (Jerome Kilty) announces: "*PRO* Let me emphaticize one thing at the outset: We are not looking for hides 0 *PRO* to skin *T*-1 nor goats 0 *PRO* to scape *T*-2."
Major Battle himself speaks in pure Pentagonese: "Without further monetary - stroke - military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who *T*-1 had gone way out on their life and limbs for us, were literally cut *-2 off at the knees without a paddle."
At another point he intones: "Publicity is a small price 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-1 for secrecy."
The evening is short--95 minutes without an intermission--but even so, as the play progresses the thrust of Mr. Gelbart's satire loses its sharpness as his targets pop up ever more predictably.
Most of the evening, though, is filled *-1 with rare and welcome wit.
In "Mastergate," Mr. Gelbart has provided us not just one but two commodities that *T*-1 have all but disappeared from the Broadway theater: sharp political satire and an even sharper appreciation of the value of language.
The New York Stock Exchange said 0 a seat sold for $436,000 *U*, down $39,000 *U* from the previous sale Oct. 4.
Seats are currently quoted *-1 at $425,000 *U* bid * and $475,000 *U* offered *.
The $475,000 *U* sale price earlier this month was the lowest in nearly three years.
Exchange seats hit a peak of $1,150,000 *U* in September 1987.
French crude - steel production in September was 1,616,000 metric tons, unchanged from a year earlier, according to the National Steel Manufacturers' Association.

Crown Resources Corp. said 0 it reached a definitive agreement *PRO* to acquire the Gold Texas Resources Ltd. shares 0 it doesn't already own *T*-1.
Under the proposed agreement, Gold Texas holders will receive 1.43 Crown shares for each of the 1.1 million Gold Texas shares not owned * by Crown, which *T*-1 already owns 65%.
The arrangement is subject to approval by the Supreme Court of British Columbia province, Crown said 0 *T*-1.
Gold Texas is based *-1 in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Crown Resources is based *-2 in Denver.
Both are mining concerns.
Canada, which *T*-1 is preparing *PRO*-2 to speed up tariff cuts with the U.S., recorded a 47% narrowing in its trade surplus with the U.S. in August, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, reported 0 *T*-3.
U.S. exports to Canada jumped 11.2% in August from July while U.S. imports from Canada rose only 2.7%.
As a result, Canada's trade surplus with the U.S. narrowed to C$656.5 million *U* (US$558 million *U*) in August from C$1.23 billion *U* (US$1.04 billion *U*) in July.
U.S. exports benefited in August from heavy Canadian spending on new plant and equipment and a pickup in Canadian auto demand, Canadian officials said 0 *T*-1.
The U.S. and Canada, which *T*-1 do more trade than any other pair of nations, are *-2 to meet next month *PRO*-3 to arrange an acceleration of planned tariff cuts under the U.S. - Canada free trade agreement.
Industries in both countries have requested a speedup of tariff cuts on hundreds of products.
Some tariffs were eliminated *-1 when the trade pact took effect Jan. 1 *T*-2.
The remainder were *-1 to be phased *-2 out in five or 10 annual installments, with all tariffs eliminated *-3 by January 1998.
The two countries aim *PRO*-3 to reach an agreement *ICH*-1 by early December on a package of accelerated tariff cuts that *T*-2 would take effect early next year.
Canadian officials said 0 the trade pact has kindled an export interest among many small Canadian companies that *T*-1 previously had little or no foreign sales.
For such businessmen, the Canadian government is organizing 55 missions this year to U.S. states bordering on Canada.
The businessmen are introduced *-1 to potential agents and distributors and instructed *-1 in trade procedures.
The U.S. Commerce Department is planning *PRO*-1 to try out similar trips on U.S. businessmen in coming months under its Canada First! Outreach Program.
Participants in the U.S. missions to Canada are *-2 to be assisted *-1 by members of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, a volunteer group, in *PRO*-1 dealing with their export challenges.
The Canadian government also has recently opened new trade offices in San Diego; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami; Princeton, N.J., and Denver, *PRO* bringing the total number of such Canadian offices in the U.S. to 27.
The U.S. has six trade promotion offices in Canada.
Canada's export effort has been blunted *-1 by robust home market demand and by an 18% appreciation of the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart in the past three years that *T*-2 has made Canadian goods more costly in the U.S. .
Canada's trade surplus with all countries narrowed to C$203.5 million *U* in August from C$528.3 million *U* in July, Statistics Canada said 0 *T*-1.
Loral Corp. said 0 it received a $325 million *U* order *ICH*-1 from Turkey's Ministry of Defense, the largest contract 0 the company ever has received *T*-2.
Loral will provide to Turkey an electronic countermeasures system for its fleet of F - 16 aircraft.
The system provides radar - threat warning and electronic jamming capabilities.
The defense electronics maker said 0 delivery will begin in October 1991 and run through mid-1995.
Loral said 0 the contract with Turkey will provide opportunities for Loral to supply that country with other defense systems.
Consolidated Papers Inc. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to spend $495 million *U* on new paper - manufacturing equipment and facilities.
The producer of paper used * in magazines and by commercial printers said 0 spending on the expansion is planned *PRO*-1 to begin in the first quarter of 1990.
The expansion is subject to approval by federal and Wisconsin environmental regulators.
Just after midnight Monday, federal spending started *-1 to drop by $16 billion *U*.
What do you say we all close down the poker game, go home and bank the $16 billion *U*?
That's essentially what budget director Richard Darman is suggesting *T*-1, and we think 0 he deserves as much support as he can get *?*.
If human beings can't cut federal spending honestly--and they can't *?*--*PRO* let the computers do it.
Congress, with a measure of White House complicity, has been manipulating the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills.
(Indeed without earlier manipulations, the current sequester of $16 billion *U* would have been even larger.)
We suspect 0 voters are fed up with the finagling.
*PRO* Consider, for instance, that even yesterday's widely publicized sequester is likely *-2 to be traduced *-1 if business as usual is allowed *PRO*-3 to prevail.
Under the law, Gramm - Rudman's across - the - board - cuts in federal programs are supposed *-1 to be permanent.
Social Security and spending for poor people are exempted *-1.
However, the Associated Press's account of the Monday sequester order signed * by President Bush neatly captured the contempt 0 Congress shows *T*-1 toward the notion of a legally binding commitment:
"Lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan *PRO*-2 to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a deficit - cutting bill."
Mr. Darman's inclination *PRO* to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater:
"There is some feeling *ICH*-1 here that the cuts are the way 0 *PRO* to go *T*-2.
It will reduce spending in a very effective fashion."
This attitude is being waved away by sophisticates around Washington as little more than tough talk.
It looks to us like a golden opportunity for George Bush to chop off at the knees all this talk about a timid, unserious presidency.
Mr. Bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the Washington elites who *T*-1 manipulate these budgets--the bureaucrats, the lobbyists, the congressional staffers--live for just one year on a restricted diet.
*PRO* Ask Tommy Lasorda; thin is in.
Senator Phil Gramm pointed out Monday that in the 20 years before Gramm - Rudman was enacted *-1 in 1985, federal spending grew by about 11% a year; since the law, it's grown at under 5% annually.
Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan's decision *ICH*-1 early in his presidency *PRO* to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than *PRO*-2 raising taxes.
George Bush's continued support of the tax dam sustains this strategy of *PRO* pressuring Congress to make choices among competing priorities, rather than *PRO*-2 just saying yes to all the grateful special - interest constituencies that *T*-1 fill the PAC trough.
If Washington's elites ever succeed in *PRO*-2 bursting the tax dam, Americans will be engulfed *-1 in a red sea of new spending programs, such as federalized child care.
Child care was one of the many "extraneous" bills pulled * out of the Senate's reconciliation bill last Friday.
Others were the capital - gains cut, Section 89 repeal, the disabled workers bill, and the unprecedented reconsideration of the catastrophic health act.
All this stuff still is in the House's 1,878 - page reconciliation bill, and many Members say 0 they're reluctant *PRO*-1 to pull out cherished bills, *PRO* just to see them die.
Republicans especially want a guarantee *ICH*-1 from the House leadership that they'll get an up - or - down vote on the bills.
House Speaker Foley ought *PRO*-1 to deliver that promise.
This is the way 0 government is supposed *-3 to work *T*-2, with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify *T*-1, instead of *PRO*-4 concealing them in the great reconciliation garbage truck.
We have as much nostalgia as anyone for those leafy, breezy days in Washington when honorable men and women dickered over budgets and even log - rolled a bit *PRO*-2 to see that the bridges got build *-3, roads paved *-4, soldiers paid *-5 or that the desperately poor were cared for *-1 *T*-7.
Those days are gone.
Nor do we see any reason 0 *PRO* to believe that a metropolitan Washington that *T*-1 has gotten fat and rich and lazy in the shadow of the federal colossus will change much on its own initiative *T*-2.
*PRO* Save the sequester, and let Washington scream.
Economist David N. Laband's Sept. 27 editorial - page article, "In Hugo's Path, a Man - Made Disaster," decries the control of price gouging, swiftly ordered * by South Carolina's governor after Hurricane Hugo.
According to Mr. Laband, *PRO* "screaming" for price controls occurs when income redistribution "threatens *PRO*-2 to hit home *T*-1."
*PRO* To be sure, the threat has hit home down here.
Yet in Mr. Laband's rehash of free - market logic, human greed and self - interest are the only permissible psychological reactions.
*PRO* Allowing uncontrolled prices for necessities would indeed shorten the lines at stores, as he contends 0 *?*.
But not because resources are going to their most efficient use, *PRO* leaving scarce goods "*PRO*-3 allocated *-2 to those buyers who *T*-1 place the highest value on them."
Rather, lines would diminish because at higher prices many victims could not afford necessities such as food and medical supplies.
It *EXP*-1 is inhumane *PRO* to imply that a poor, unemployed woman cannot receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much 0 *PRO* to protect *T*-2 as a rich family.
Moreover, essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed *-1 throughout the population because of potential health problems from spoiled food and possible outbreak of disease.
Such spillover effects give the state a right *PRO* to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources.
Fortunately, volunteers and charities are not motivated *-1 by self - interest, but by altruism.
Why should they have *-1 to co-exist with opportunists rushing in *PRO* to turn a quick profit *T*-2?
These latter - day scalawags would be ill - advised *PRO*-1 to take advantage of the situation, if they ever expect *PRO*-2 to face the people of South Carolina again.
The government is actually protecting avaricious ice - baggers and other profiteers who *T*-1 cannot see beyond their own short - term gain.
South Carolina deserves an A for its quick and timely relief efforts.
Mr. Laband, meanwhile, gets an A for his rote recital of economic - efficiency arguments.
*PRO* Give him an F for his failure *PRO* to understand the ethics of economic equity.

Mr. Laband gives us an idea why economists' predictions are usually wrong *T*-1.
They set up absurd situations, detached * from reality, and then try *PRO*-1 to reason from them.
I'm surprised 0 he didn't advocate *PRO*-2 letting people loot, since that behavior can also be foreseen *-1 in a disaster and "every individual has an incentive *PRO* to alter the distribution of income in his favor."
Price controls were "so fervently embraced *-1 by Charleston" because price gouging in this situation is equivalent to looting.
Suzanne Foster

Mr. Laband described one of the more insidious threats 0 we face *T*-1 when *PRO*-3 dealing with disasters such as Hugo *T*-2--anti-profiteering ordinances such as that by the Charleston City Council as it thrashed about *PRO*-4 trying *PRO*-5 to Do Something.
Since he concentrated on the economic folly of such ordinances, he didn't mention certain other of their effects.
They divert law - enforcement resources at a time 0 they are most needed *-1 for *PRO*-1 protecting lives and property *T*-2.
Also, rather than *PRO*-1 increase supplies, they reduce them and encourage hoarding.
And they, or even the prospect of them, discourage disaster preparedness in the form of speculative advance stocking of supplies by merchants.

Would Mr. Laband also suggest that the Red Cross, Salvation Army, military units, police, fire departments, rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts *PRO* to assist Hugo's victims because they interfere with his concept of the "free market"?
What about those caring people all over the country who *T*-1 are donating food, water and other necessities of life to these people who *T*-2 could be any of us?
Should they, too, stop *-1 "messing with" his free market?
Maybe he thinks 0 they should also sell to the highest bidder.
And what about insurance firms?
Should they be required *-1 *PRO*-2 to pay claims based on exorbitant costs for labor and materials?
Mr. Laband should beware, since he lives in South Carolina.
In a free market, his insurance rates can be raised *-1 *PRO* to recover insurance - company losses.

*PRO*-1 Having been through several tornadoes and hurricanes, I have a different perspective.
Mine comes from *PRO* seeing thriving communities devastated *-1--but only temporarily.
Their recovery came surprisingly fast, and always with the help of neighbors.
The shock of *PRO* seeing homes destroyed *-1 and city services disrupted *-2 may cause some to confuse priorities such as the true economic value of a freezer full of meat.
In Texas after Hurricane Alicia, major grocery chains used their truck fleets *PRO*-1 to ship essential goods to Houston, no gouging, just good will.

We here in the affected areas were dazzled *-1 by Mr. Laband's analysis of time values and his comparisons of effectiveness concerning research and development.
His theoretical approach and its publication in this venerable paper are no doubt a noteworthy accomplishment for him.
Too bad theory fails in practice.
We consumers tend *-1 to have long memories.
The businesses subscribing to Mr. Laband's effective price system will be remembered *-1 when normalcy returns *T*-2.
Perhaps, *PRO*-1 considering the value of our time, we will be unable *PRO*-1 to patronize their establishments in the post-Hugo era.
I have a question for Mr. Laband: How do I explain to the single mother of three standing in line next to me for the past three hours that the two bags of ice 0 she needs *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to keep her children's food *PRO*-4 edible will take her last $20 *U* *T*-3?
I'm sure 0 she'll appreciate what an efficient reaction to her problems the price system has created *T*-1.

The former president of FirstSouth F.A., a defunct Arkansas thrift, pleaded guilty to *PRO*-1 conspiring *PRO*-2 to inflate the institution's earnings by *PRO*-3 concealing worthless loan guarantees.
Roderick D. Reed III, who *T*-1 was also chief operating officer of FirstSouth, could receive a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and a $250,000 *U* fine.
A sentencing date hasn't been set *-1.
Mr. Reed admitted 0 he conspired *PRO*-1 to conceal an agreement *PRO* not to enforce loan guarantees executed * by Dallas real - estate developers A. Starke Taylor III and George S. Watson, both of whom *T*-2 were FirstSouth stockholders.
Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Watson have been charged *-1 with criminal wrongdoing.
By *PRO* concealing the non-enforcement agreement, certain transactions with Messrs. Taylor and Watson were entered *-1 on FirstSouth's books as loans, *PRO* allowing the thrift to report fees and interest as current income, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Little Rock, Ark.
The conspiracy was part of an effort *ICH*-1 by Mr. Reed *PRO* to hide FirstSouth's shaky financial condition from federal regulators, according to federal prosecutors and regulators.
The $1.68 billion *U* thrift was declared *-1 insolvent and closed *-1 in December 1986.
FirstSouth's former chairman and chief executive officer, Howard Weichern, is also charged *-1 with *PRO*-1 conspiring *PRO*-2 to conceal the agreements with Messrs. Watson and Taylor.
Mr. Weichern is scheduled *-1 for trial Jan. 3 before federal Judge Stephen Reasoner of Little Rock.
Steve Jobs took a step back from the frontier of personal - computer technology in an effort *PRO* to spur sales of Next Inc.'s new machine.
Mr. Jobs moved *PRO*-1 to remedy a couple of his computer's drawbacks yesterday by *PRO*-2 lowering the entry - level price for a Next machine by $1,500 *U*, or 23%, if the buyer chooses a hard - disk drive as an alternative to Next's optical - storage device.
The hard drive, which *T*-1 is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user, also now will supplement Next's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price.
Mr. Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., founded Next four years ago in the hopes of *PRO*-1 fomenting a revolution in the way 0 desktop computers are designed and used *-3 *T*-2.
His Next computer, introduced * about a year ago and aimed * primarily at university computer users, sports snazzy graphics, digital sound, built - in networking and a sleek black design.
But the computer was proving *-2 a hard sell because of its high price, a lack of software and an optical data - storage device that *T*-1 was too slow.
The machine began shipping at the end of last year.
The closely held company hasn't disclosed sales.
However, most universities that *T*-1 have bought the machines say 0 they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes.
Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for $4,995 *U*.
A computer with the optical device will still cost $6,495 *U*, but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who *T*-1 have already bought Next machines.
Commercial customers can purchase the same system through Businessland Inc., a computer retailer based * in San Jose, Calif., for roughly $3,000 *U* more.
Mr. Jobs said 0 the changes were prompted *-1 by requests from customers who *T*-3 are frustrated *-2 with the performance of the optical device, which *T*-4 isn't offered *-5 as standard equipment by any rivals.
Another factor was that customers were asking, "Why don't you give us a cheaper system *T*-1?" Mr. Jobs said 0 *T*-2 at a conference on university computing here.
Optical - storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it *EXP*-1 far easier *PRO* to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer.
But the technology, while reliable, is far slower than the widely used hard drives.
*PRO*-2 To get around the delays caused * by the optical device, Businessland, which *T*-1 is Next's exclusive dealer to corporations, has for months been advising customers *PRO*-3 to purchase hard drives with the machines.
Next's decision *PRO* to rely on the more - established hard drive in every Next computer doesn't signal a retreat from optical storage, said 0 *T*-2 Mr. Jobs, who *T*-1 for years has said 0 this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade.
"We're extremely committed *-2 to optical storage technology" he said *T*-1.
"We think 0 everything will go this way in a few years."
He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives, but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices.
But university computer specialists, who *T*-1 welcomed the move, called it *PRO*-4 a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that *T*-2's likely *-3 to increase Next's sales on campuses.
"From the standpoint of *PRO* being on the forefront of technology, this is a step backward," said *T*-1 Jerry W. Sprecher, a senior computing manager for the California state university system.
"But it will definitely boost Next's sales."
Universities, however, say 0 Next's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine.
"We'd still like *PRO*-2 to see a student model," priced * at about $3,500 *U*, said 0 *T*-3 Ronald Johnson, director of academic computing at Minnesota's Gustavus Adolphus College, which *T*-1 has bought eight Next machines.
Broad acceptance of Next's computer also is hindered *-1 by difficulty in *PRO* distributing software for it.
Most software is distributed *-1 on cheap floppy disks, but the Next computer doesn't come with a device that *T*-2 reads them.
Next's computer also needs more software applications, but Mr. Jobs said 0 he expects more soon.
He said 0 he expects Lotus Development Corp. to introduce a Next version of its popular 1 - 2 - 3 spreadsheet program in 1990.
Educators added that Next needs *PRO*-1 to soon offer a color version of its computer.
Every major maker offers computers with color displays.
Next won't comment on when it will do the same *T*-1, but is believed *-2 to have a color model under development.
General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division, *PRO*-1 reacting to slow sales, said 0 it will offer $800 *U* rebates on its 1990 Beretta, the two - door version of its core compact - car line.
Sluggish sales of the Beretta, and its four - door sister car, the Corsica, prompted GM *PRO*-2 to idle the two plants that *T*-1 build the automobiles for a total of three weeks this month.
The Corsica and Beretta make up the highest - volume car line at Chevrolet, but sales of the vehicles are off 9.6% for the year, and fell a steep 34% during early October.
Chevrolet already is offering an $800 *U* rebate on the 1990 - model Corsica.
The latest rebate is good for all Beretta models.
Chevrolet buyers can take the rebate, or get discount financing at rates ranging from 6.9% on 24 - month loans to 10.9% on 60 - month loans.
The dollar finished softer yesterday, *PRO*-1 tilted *-2 lower by continued concern about the stock market.
"We're trading with a very wary eye on Wall Street," said *T*-1 Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in New York.
"No one is willing *PRO*-1 to place a firm bet that the stock market won't take another tumultuous ride."
News of the major earthquake in California Tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early Asian trade, but most foreign - exchange dealers said 0 they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short - lived.
Despite the dollar's lackluster performance, some foreign - exchange traders maintain that the U.S. unit remains relatively well bid.
Harris Trust's Mr. Woodland noted that the unit continues *-1 to show resilience in the face of a barrage of "headline negatives" in recent weeks, including rate increases in Europe and Japan, aggressive central bank intervention, a 190 - point plunge in New York stock prices, an unexpectedly poor U.S. trade report and action *ICH*-2 by the Federal Reserve *PRO* to nudge U.S. rates lower.
While Mr. Woodland doesn't predict a significant climb for the U.S. unit in light of recent moves in interest rates around the world, he noted that "its downside potential is surprisingly and--for dollar bulls--"impressively" limited.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8485 marks, down from 1.8667 marks late Tuesday, and at 141.45 yen, down from 142.75 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $1.5920 *U*, up from $1.5753 *U* late Tuesday.
In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 140.97 yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 142.10 yen.
Since Friday's dive in stock market prices, the Fed has injected reserves into the banking system in an effort *PRO* to calm the markets and avert a repeat of 1987's stock market debacle.
Some analysts note that after last week's stock market tailspin and Tuesday's California earthquake, it *EXP*-3's hard *PRO* to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate *T*-1.
They say that the earthquake, by *PRO*-1 preventing many banks from *PRO*-2 operating at full capacity, has given the Fed an additional reason 0 *PRO* to keep liquidity at a high level *T*-3.
The Fed did, in fact, execute $1.5 billion *U* of liquidity - enhancing customer repurchase agreements, the third set of repurchase orders in three days.
Analysts said 0 the additional liquidity should tend *-1 to reduce the federal funds rate.
For now, traders say 0 the foreign exchange market is scrutinizing both federal funds and events on Wall Street.
They note that the dollar remains extremely vulnerable to the slightest bad news from the stock exchange.
Indeed, the U.S. unit edged lower as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 13 points in early trading.
A slight recovery in the stock market gave currency traders confidence 0 *PRO* to push the dollar higher before the unit dropped back by day's end *T*-1.
Some dealers noted that nervousness over the recent sharp dive in stock prices could intensify following suggestions by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that *T*-1 appeared *-2 to advise Japanese investors *PRO*-3 to be very careful in *PRO*-4 investing in U.S. leveraged buy - outs.
Dealers suggest that the only positive news on the horizon that *T*-1 could detract attention from equities transactions is September's U.S. consumer price data.
The figures, due for release Friday, are expected *-1 to show an uptick in inflation to 4.8% from 4.7% in August.
If the figures show a hefty rise in inflation, they could militate against easing by the Fed.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.30 *U* to $368.70 *U* an ounce in moderate trading.

This seems *-1 to be the season for revivals in Chicago.
Though the Cubs' championship season ended with the National League playoffs, a revival of the Organic Theater's production of "Bleacher Bums," a play in nine innings set * in the Wrigley Field bleachers, continues within spitting distance of the ballpark.
Revivals of a different sort also are being offered *-1 by our two major theater troupes, the Goodman and Steppenwolf.
Each is more problematic than an unexpected divisional baseball championship, but both help *PRO*-1 explain why Chicago remains a vital center of this country's regional theater movement *T*-2.
The Goodman is offering a modernized version of Moliere's "The Misanthrope" through Nov. 4.
The original is a comedy about Alceste, a man who *T*-1 sees falseness and vanity in everyone except himself.
He is the jealous friend of Philinte, and the jealous lover of Celimene.
The play is filled *-1 with intrigue, dishonesty and injustice.
Twenty - five years ago the poet Richard Wilbur modernized this 17th - century comedy merely by *PRO*-1 avoiding "the zounds sort of thing," as he wrote in his introduction.
Otherwise, the scene remained Celimene's house in 1666.
*PRO*-1 Assuming 0 modern audiences readily understand that Moliere's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th - century Paris, Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on *PRO*-1 rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter.
The Wilbur translation is remarkable--well worth a read and even better *PRO* seen *-1 in the theater if you ever have the opportunity.
But if you happen *-1 to be coming to Chicago in the next few weeks, *PRO* don't fail *-2 to have a look at Robert Falls's "The Misanthrope" at the Goodman.
If Mr. Wilbur's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th - century Paris *T*-1, Mr. Falls's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves *T*-2.
Mr. Falls, the Goodman's artistic director, took a recent adaptation by Neil Bartlett and significantly adapted it.
Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain.
Mr. Falls transfers the setting to Hollywood, and transforms the characters into what *T*-1 passes for aristocracy there--agents, producers, actors, writers and sycophants.
It works.
Mr. Bartlett managed *PRO*-1 to more or less maintain Moliere's Alexandrine verse form, 12 syllable lines in rhyming couplets.
Mr. Falls kept the form, but Americanized it with Mr. Bartlett's further help.
With a splendid cast led * by David Darlow as Alceste, Christina Haag as Celimene and, especially, William Brown as a Philinte who *T*-1 plays the Hollywood game but harbors authentic values and feelings, the Goodman production barrels through an all - night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit.
If this version, with its references to Steven Spielberg, Spago and "thirtysomething" attracts younger audiences who *T*-1 might stay away from the classical version, then Messrs. Bartlett and Falls are justified in *PRO*-2 abandoning Mr. Wilbur.
A 300 - year - old play may be easier 0 *PRO* to revive *T*-1 than one merely 25.
The Steppenwolf Theatre Company, back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," opened the new season with Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming," first produced * by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965.
Back then, Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright, but also the first 0 *T*-1 to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares, almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood *T*-2 to be theatrical dialogue.
When "The Homecoming" was first produced *-2 on this side of the Atlantic *T*-1, actors and directors were reverential.
Silences were lengthy--nobody moved or gestured.
Nobody smiled onstage, and nobody in the audience was encouraged *-1 *PRO*-2 to laugh.
This kind of theater was new to us.
Also, it was not a funny time over here, what with the Vietnam War, the '68 Democratic convention, assassinations and riots.
But under Jerry Perry's direction the current Steppenwolf production, scheduled *PRO* to play through Nov. 19, breaks through the flat and boring ritual that "The Homecoming" had become *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Led *-2 by a near - perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation.
*PRO*-2 Encouraged *-1 by Mr. Wilder's sly grins, embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages, the audience gets the joke and begins *-2 to laugh before the end of the first act.
Three of the family members, Max and his two sons, Lenny and Joey, live off the flesh: Max is a retired butcher, Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer.
Sam, Max's brother, has escaped the flesh by *PRO*-1 working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife.
Teddy, the eldest of Max's sons, has made the most dramatic escape by *PRO*-1 becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university.
Though it's clearly Max's wife who *T*-1 held sway here until her death, now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge Max.
The play concerns Teddy's homecoming with his wife of six years, Ruth.
Curiously, Randall Arney as Teddy seems *-1 the only cast member unable *PRO* to get beyond the zombie approach to a Pinter character.
As Ruth, Moira Harris, a large and beautiful woman who *T*-1 may be our next Colleen Dewhurst, begins almost immediately *-2 to overpower each of the men.
In the end, Teddy returns alone to America, *PRO*-1 leaving Ruth in Max's chair.
We have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown in - law to a goddess of the flesh who *T*-1 will replace the dead mother, and then some.
While Steppenwolf was in London with "The Grapes of Wrath," Bruce Sagan, the president of its board of directors, quietly returned to Chicago *PRO*-1 to buy a piece of real estate in the city's rapidly reviving North Halsted Street restaurant and theater district.
Within a year he hopes 0 Steppenwolf will move into a new 500 - seat theater on that site.
The troupe currently performs in a converted dairy that *T*-1 seats 211 and provides little capacity for *PRO* staging anything beyond a simple one - set production.
"If we wanted *PRO*-2 to stage ` Death of a Salesman,' "Mr. Sagan says *?*, "Willie Loman would have *-1 to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling."
Steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space.
It's currently forced *-3 *PRO*-4 to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the 13,000 who *T*-2 can be accommodated *-1 in its present digs.
For all the attention that Chicago theater has received *T*-2 during the past decade, not one new building has been devoted *-1 to it.
Mr. Sagan, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million *U* financial package that *T*-1 includes approximately $4 million *U* of tax exempt bonds issued * by the State of Illinois (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority *PRO*-2 to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million *U* in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the MacArthur Foundation, and a few other deep pockets.
The rest, he is confident 0 *?*, can be raised *-1.
His board members alone have pledged $800,000 *U* and he is just beginning *-1 to massage local foundations and corporations.
Mr. Sagan compares the importance of Steppenwolf with Orson Welles's Mercury Theater in the '30s.
But Welles's theater company turned out *-1 to have a brief--one might say a mercurial--existence.
What will Mr. Sagan do *T*-1 with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves *-2 too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons"), Joan Allen ("The Heidi Chronicles"), and Glenne Headly ("Lonesome Dove"), and the company crumbles?
"That's OK," Mr. Sagan replies *T*-1.
"*PRO* Let this building be Steppenwolf's legacy to Chicago theater."

Efforts *ICH*-2 by a federal mediator *PRO* to reignite talks between Boeing Co. and the Machinists union apparently failed, and no further meetings are scheduled *-1.
Company officials and union representatives didn't meet face to face, but the mediator shuttled between the two groups.
In a statement issued * after the meeting, the aerospace giant said 0 it won't increase its offer although adjustments within the proposed pay - and - benefit mix are possible.
Machinists already have rejected a proposal that *T*-1 called for a 4% pay increase and 8% bonus in the first year.
In the second year, workers would receive a 3% wage boost and a 3% bonus, followed by a 3% increase without a bonus in the third year.
"The company will not budge on anything," said *T*-1 a spokesman for the union.
As the strike enters its 15th day today, some members are getting nervous, the spokesman conceded 0 *?*, but the majority of the 55,000 Machinists are prepared *PRO*-1 to "wait it out as long as it takes *?*.
In one of the first indoor air - pollution cases 0 *T*-1 to go to trial, a state - court jury decided in favor of the defendant, Burlington Industries Inc.
The verdict, reached * late last week in Cincinnati, may end an eight - year legal battle for the Greensboro, N.C., carpet maker.
Glenn and Sharon Beebe of Cincinnati had sued the com - pany in 1981 after *PRO*-1 installing Burlington carpets in their office.
The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick.
As a result of their illness, the Beebes said 0 *?*, they lost $1.8 million *U* in wages and earnings.
In addition, they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them *PRO*-1 sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances.
The case had been closely watched *-1 because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so - called sick - building syndrome.
Plaintiffs' lawyers say that buildings become "sick" when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants *PRO*-2 to build up inside *T*-1.
Anthony J. Iaciofano, a lawyer for Burlington, said 0 the company believes 0 the Beebes' symptoms were not related to the carpeting.
He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes' symptoms appeared months later.
Catherine Adams, the Beebes' lawyer, said 0 the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from *PRO*-1 filing such suits.
Scientists are only beginning *-2 to understand what *T*-1 causes sick - building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case *T*-3, she said 0 *T*-4.
The Beebes now believe that a prime culprit for their injuries was fumes from an adhesive used * in the carpeting.
But the Beebes didn't come to that conclusion until time limits *ICH*-2 had elapsed for *PRO* adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in the case, Ms. Adams said 0 *T*-1.
The Beebes have not yet decided whether *PRO*-1 to appeal.
TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt *-1 setback.
The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court dismissed six lawsuits attempting *PRO* to block a $2.5 billion *U* project planned * for 42nd Street in Manhattan.
Opponents of the project had claimed that the city and the state of New York, which *T*-1 are co-sponsoring the project, had failed *-2 to adhere to environmental guidelines.
All but two of the 40 or so lawsuits that *T*-3 have been filed *-2 since the project's 1984 approval have been dismissed *-1 before the trial stage.
The two that *T*-1 remain haven't yet reached the pre-trial fact - finding stage.
State officials said 0 the court's ruling clears the way for proceedings 0 *T*-1 to condemn buildings in the area.
"This project is ready *PRO*-2 to move," said *T*-1 State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese.
But developers of four planned office towers cautioned that obstacles still remain.
As part of the agreement with the state, the developers--a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America--said 0 they would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was "significant litigation" pending.
Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer said 0 the development team will have *-1 to review two additional lawsuits before *PRO*-2 putting up a $155 million *U* letter of credit 0 *T*-3 to cover condemnation costs.
Also, he said 0 *?*, the partnership is waiting *PRO*-3 to see whether the appellate division's ruling will be appealed *-1.
The plan, which *T*-2 has been plagued *-1 with delays and business - related setbacks, seeks *PRO*-3 to transform the area from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district.
State and city officials are still negotiating with developers *PRO*-1 to renovate historic theaters and build and operate a merchandise mart and hotel.
FEDERAL JUDGE EXPANDS role of U.S. courts in extradition decisions.
U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, N.Y., ruled that a man implicated * in an attack on an Israeli passenger bus in 1986 can be extradited *-1 to Israel for trial.
A magistrate had initially refused the request, *PRO*-1 ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the man, Mahmoud El - Abed Ahmad, would be exempt from extradition *T*-2.
However, Judge Weinstein wrote in his opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians cannot be defined *-1 as political acts.
Judge Weinstein also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated *-1 fairly in a foreign court.
*PRO*-1 To do so, the judge said 0 *?*, the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of the State Department's assessment.
He said that in this case he concurred with the State Department's decision that Mr. Ahmad should be extradited *-1.
Mr. Ahmad's lawyer said 0 he would appeal.
Lawyers close to the case said 0 they believed 0 the ruling was unprecedented.
"Up until now the courts have said 0 it *EXP*-2 is not their role *PRO* to supervise the foreign country's courts," said *T*-1 Jacques Semmelman, the assistant U.S. attorney on the case.
FORMER CANADIAN AMBASSADOR to the U.S. Allan E. Gotlieb has joined the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz as a consultant.
Mr. Gotlieb, who *T*-1 serves as a consultant to Stikeman, Elliott, one of Canada's biggest law firms, is advising Pepper Hamilton's Washington office on legal matters related to Canadian - U.S. investment, corporate finance and international transactions.
QUOTABLE:
In a speech prepared * for delivery in New York yesterday, retired Justice Lewis Powell contested the notion that the last Supreme Court term marked a turn toward conservatism: "Commentators who *T*-1 agreed on little else unanimously proclaimed a ` shift in direction' on the court....
I take these pronouncements, like many that *T*-1 have preceded them in past years, with a grain of salt.
In an era of ` sound bites' and instant opinion polls it *EXP*-3 is dangerous *PRO* to apply broad labels to a single term.
Boeing Co., already struck * by its Machinists union, briefly called off contract talks with its engineers and labeled their demands "*PRO*-1 grossly excessive."
Later, however, the company agreed *PRO*-1 to meet on Monday with the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association after a federal mediator intervened, according to the union.
A spokesman for the engineers said 0 the company asked the union *PRO*-2 to reduce its demands, which *T*-1 included a 19% pay hike in the first year and 8% in the second and third years.
The union represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers.
Its contract expires Dec. 1.
Meanwhile, a federal mediator is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to meet today with Boeing officials and representatives of 55,000 striking Machinists.
"It *EXP*-1 will take several meetings *PRO* to resolve this," said *T*-2 a spokesman for the Machinists union.
"We don't want *PRO*-2 to bring back something 0 the members will reject *T*-1."
Machinists already have rejected a package that *T*-1 would have provided a 10% pay raise plus bonuses over the three - year life of the contract.
It also would have reduced mandatory overtime.
Banc One Corp. said 0 Frank E. McKinney plans *PRO*-1 to retire as the bank holding company's president effective Jan. 12.
Banc One said 0 "it *EXP*-1 is contemplated *-2" that John B. McCoy, chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the additional position of president upon Mr. McKinney's retirement.
Mr. McKinney, 50 years old, was chairman *RNR*-2 and chief executive *RNR*-2 of American Fletcher Corp., Indianapolis, when that bank holding company merged into Banc One in January 1987 *T*-1.
The company said 0 Mr. McKinney plans *PRO*-2 to retire because the process of *PRO* affiliating American Fletcher into Banc One "is considered *-1 completed."
Mr. McKinney will continue as chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee of Banc One Indiana Corp., the successor company to American Fletcher Corp., but will no longer be active in day - to - day management.
He will remain on the Banc One board.
The average interest rate fell to 8.292% at Citicorp's $50 million *U* weekly auction of 91 - day commercial paper, or corporate IOUs, from 8.483% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $465 million *U* were submitted *-1, and accepted bids were at 8.292%.
Citicorp also said that the average rate fell to 7.986% at its $50 million *U* auction of 182 - day commercial paper from 8.1255% at last week's sale.
Bids totaling $415 million *U* were submitted *-1, and accepted bids were at 7.986%.
The bank holding company will auction another $50 million *U* of commercial paper in each maturity next Tuesday.
It *EXP*-1 is now a commonplace that prosecutors are bringing criminal indictments in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought *-2 *T*-3.
Yet it *EXP*-2 is also axiomatic that the power *PRO* to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature, and not to courts.
Beginning in the early 19th century, with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power *PRO* to declare conduct *PRO* to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while *PRO*-1 well established in British law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers.
That's the conventional theory anyway.
In practice, however, the line between interpretation and redefinition of the criminal law long ago began *-1 to blur.
In particular, a common law of white - collar crime has developed with surprising rapidity over the past decade.
For example, although insider trading has long been criminal, it has never been statutorily defined *-1.
In 1983, the Supreme Court tried *PRO*-1 to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v. SEC decision, which *T*-4 found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order *PRO* to obtain "some personal gain" and whether the tippee knew *RNR*-3 or recklessly disregarded *RNR*-3 this fact.
Gradually, however, lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point.
*PRO* Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman.
Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986, the founder of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain called an elderly relative *PRO* to tell her *PRO*-1 to assemble her stock certificates for delivery.
She called her daughter *ICH*-1 *PRO* to take her to the bank, who, in turn, *T*-2 persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, *PRO*-3 to run this errand.
*PRO*-1 Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, Mr. Chestman, and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients.
Basically, Mr. Chestman was a fourth - level tippee.
Did Mr. Loeb, his tipper, breach a fiduciary duty (and, if so, to whom)?
Did Mr. Loeb seek personal gain (and if so, how)?
Or did Mr. Chestman only hear a market rumor (which one may lawfully trade upon *T*-1)?
The line seems *-1 awfully thin for criminal - law purposes.
A second illustration is supplied *-1 by the recent guilty plea entered * by Robert Freeman, formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy - out, when he was told *-1 by another prominent trader, Bernard "Bunny" Lasker, that the deal was in trouble *T*-2.
After *PRO* placing orders *PRO* to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co., who *T*-1 was advising on the deal, *PRO* to confirm these rumors.
Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was *T*-1 and, on *PRO*-2 hearing that it was Bunny Lasker, responded: "0 Well, your bunny has a good nose."
The illegal "tip" of the bunny's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known * to many in the market.
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced:
Was there a fiduciary breach in order *PRO* to obtain personal gain?
Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this?
Finally, was the information material?
Yet, all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue: Who *T*-5 is *RNR*-4 and who *T*-6 should be *RNR*-4 making the criminal law here?
It *EXP*-5 is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.
Arguably, both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky.
But even if they behaved recklessly, reasons *ICH*-6 still exist *PRO* to fear and resist this steady process of case - by - case judicial extension of the law of insider trading.
Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors.
After - the - fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method.
When only civil liability is involved *-1 *T*-2, this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization.
Still, case - by - case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused * by a fixation on ad hoc (and usually sleazy) examples.
When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading *PRO* to reach this conduct *T*-3, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that *T*-2 will be covered *-1 by the expanded rule.
Thus, a court is poorly positioned *PRO* to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule.
For example, in *PRO* focusing on Mr. Freeman's attempt *PRO* to gain nonpublic information about a deal's collapse, one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin: What if the rumor had been false?
Can a security analyst call an investment banker *PRO* to make certain that a seemingly improbable rumor is in fact false?
In the past, not only would reputable professionals have rushed *PRO*-2 to check out such rumors with the company, but companies listed * on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges *-1 *PRO*-3 to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts.
Today, after Mr. Freeman's plea, there is an uncertainty that *T*-1 is both unfair and inefficient.
In this light, the comparative advantages of legislative law - making become clear: (1) Before it acts, the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected * by its decision, not just the immediate parties before the court; and (2) the legislature can frame "bright line" standards that *T*-1 create less uncertainty than the fact - bound decisions of courts.
Although legislative lines can result in under - inclusion (which *T*-1 explains why the SEC has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading *T*-2), judicial lawmaking inevitably creates uncertainty because of the shadowy outer edges and implications of most judicial decisions.
At least when the stakes are high *T*-1, uncertainty in turn results in overinclusion, as individuals do not dare *PRO*-2 to approach an uncertain line closely.
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white - collar crime.
In 1987, the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v. U.S. *PRO*-1 to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by *PRO* adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.
Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by *PRO* enacting a one - sentence statute that *T*-1 defined fraud *PRO* to include any scheme *PRO* to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services."
At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches (and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee).
Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem: Congress finds 0 it *EXP*-7 is easier *ICH*-1 *PRO* to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions, which the courts must thereafter interpret *T*-10, than *PRO* to engage in the difficult line - drawing distinctions that *T*-9 are inherently its responsibility.
We are confronted *-1 less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway.
Predictably, when *PRO*-3 confronted with morally dubious behavior *T*-2, prosecutors will exploit the latitude 0 such openended statutes give them *T*-1.
Over the long run, however, sleazy cases will make bad law.

Certainly conservative environmentalists can defend their limited government position by *PRO*-1 differentiating between Old Environmentalism and New Environmentalism ("Journalists and Others for Saving the Planet," by David Brooks, editorial page, Oct. 5).
Old Environmentalism involved microbe hunters and sanitationists.
It started with improvements in hygiene made *PRO* possible by affordable soap and washable underwear during the Industrial Revolution.
Then cast - iron sewer pipe and the flush toilet were followed *-1 by sewage - and water - treatment plants toward the end of the 19th century.
Medicine in the 19th century was dedicated *-1 mostly to *PRO* combating sepsis and diagnostic analysis.
Then the 20th century saw the evolution of private - sector wonder drugs, which *T*-1 promulgated medical therapy.
The process dramatically increased our average life expectancy, eliminated much pain and constantly improved health and well - being.
Most public - health measures were handled *-1 at the local level.
New Environmentalism probably started in 1962 with the publication of Rachel Carson's book "Silent Spring."
Shortly thereafter, hysterical articles began *-1 to appear *PRO* predicting that advanced industrial societies would produce a blackened, uninhabitable planet possibly by the turn of the century.
These apocalyptic predictions were advanced *-1 by such stalwarts as Paul Ehrlich, Barry Commoner, Rene Dubois and George Wald.
*PRO*-2 Writing in the 1960s Ms. Carson suggested that the human race could be eliminated *-1 in 20 years, and Mr. Wald suggested that life on earth might end by 1985.
Mr. Ehrlich predicted unprecedented famine by 1980.
There were many more.
Thousands of chemical products were categorized *-1 as carcinogenic, with recommendations that they be banned *-2 from industrial use because they produced malignant tumors in overdosed rats.
Unknown before 1960 were *T*-2 the inconclusive effects of acid rain, greenhouse warming and ozone depletion, all of which *T*-1 required burgeoning political power and gargantuan expense.
Meanwhile, the New Environmentalists systematically opposed the methods of the Old Environmentalists.
Local pollution problems require cheap energy and capital for their solution.
But the New Environmentalists oppose private wealth creation (which, they claim 0 *T*-2, *T*-1 depletes natural resources) and nuclear power (even though it would counteract the greenhouse effect).
They are in the forefront of *PRO* opposing the search for new landfills and methods of incineration and even oppose new methods of research such as genetic engineering.
New Environmentalism is an emotional attack on proven methods of *PRO* improving our quality of life and a bid for political power.
*PRO* Let's *PRO*-1 rationalize our priorities by *PRO* solving pollution problems at the local level as heretofore.

Your story missed some essential points of the conference on "The Global Environment: Are We Overreacting?"
First and foremost, the vignettes presented * by the various scientists represent a general consensus among specialists working in the respective aspects of the global environment.
*PRO* Consider, for example, the greenhouse effect and climate change; numerous blue - ribbon scientific committees, including one from the National Academy of Science, judge 0 there is a greater than 50% probability of a grave problem in the offing.
The point was *PRO* to answer the question in the conference title, not *PRO* to try *PRO*-1 to create news stories for the event itself.
Nor was it intended *PRO* to dictate a set of prescriptive solutions, although various points were raised *-1.
Each speaker was asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to address a specific topic, not deliver a point of view.
Each scientist independently concluded 0 society and government are underreacting when it comes to substantive policy change *T*-1.
This leads to a very special sense of urgency.
If the media decide *PRO*-2 to work harder at *PRO* educating the public about these complex and technical issues, that hardly can be termed *-1 *PRO*-3 non-objective journalism.
The environment can no longer be a normal issue, *PRO* to be dealt *-1 with on a business - as - usual basis with comfortable increments of change.
We have literally altered the chemistry and physics of our planet's atmosphere.
This portends consequences from what we have already done *T*-2 that *T*-1 will be very destabilizing to social and economic systems.
The problems of the environment are so interrelated, so inextricably entwined with our current way of life and so large that it *EXP*-2 is unlikely 0 we will be able *PRO* to address them effectively unless major changes are made *-1 in less than 10 years.
The consensus from the scientific community is that there is sufficient evidence *PRO* to advise major policy changes.
No, we are not overreacting.

In a move that *T*-1 could pose a new competitive challenge to Time Warner Inc.'s powerful Home Box Office, cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. agreed *PRO*-2 to buy half of Showtime Networks Inc. from Viacom Inc. for $225 million *U*.
The purchase comes after nearly three years of on - again off - again talks between TCI and Viacom, which *T*-1 has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators.
Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office, and in May filed a $2.5 billion *U* antitrust suit against Time Warner, *PRO* charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with *PRO* conspiring *PRO*-1 to monopolize the pay TV business.
HBO has close to 24 million subscribers to its HBO and Cinemax networks, while Showtime and its sister service, The Movie Channel, have only about 10 million, according to Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., research firm.
For TCI, the investment in Showtime puts it in an unusual position; as the largest cable operator, with control of close to 12 million of the nation's 52 million cable subscribers, TCI is HBO's largest customer.
But TCI President John Malone has long been concerned about HBO's dominance of the pay TV business, and has been eager *PRO* to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor.
"It *EXP*-1 is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay - television marketplace," Mr. Malone said *T*-2 in a statement.
In a telephone interview, Robert Thomson, TCI senior vice president, said 0 Showtime's suit against HBO "doesn't involve us, and nothing 0 we're doing *T*-1 here bears any relationship to that."
He added, "We don't intend *PRO*-2 to be drawn *-1 into it," *PRO* noting that TCI won't play any active role in the management of Showtime.
*PRO* Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers.
TCI said 0 it may bring in other cable operators as investors, a practice 0 it has employed *T*-1 in the past with investments in other cable networks, such as The Discovery Channel.
Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further.
Time Warner declined comment.
In addition to *PRO*-1 owning HBO, Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc., the nation's second largest cable operator after TCI.
Viacom also owns cable systems, but it is the 14th largest operator of such systems, with less than one million subscribers.
The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom's chief executive officer, Frank Biondi, and Winston H. Cox, president of the Showtime unit.
"This takes any question of Showtime's viability and puts it away once and for all," Mr. Biondi said *T*-1 in a telephone interview.
The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO, and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service.
They were both hired *-2 by Sumner Redstone, the Boston billionaire who *T*-1 took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy - out.
Time Warner has vigorously denied all of Viacom's allegations.
Rockwell International Corp.'s Tulsa unit said 0 it signed a tentative agreement extending its contract *ICH*-1 with Boeing Co. *PRO* to provide structural parts for Boeing's 747 jetliners.
Rockwell said 0 the agreement calls for it to supply 200 additional so - called shipsets for the planes.
These include, among other parts, each jetliner's two major bulkheads, a pressure floor, torque box, fixed leading edges for the wings and an aft keel beam.
Under the existing contract, Rockwell said, it has already delivered 793 of the shipsets to Boeing.
Rockwell, based * in El Segundo, Calif., is an aerospace, electronics, automotive and graphics concern.
When Maj. Moises Giroldi, the leader of the abortive coup in Panama, was buried *-1 *T*-2, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.
They were the signature of his adversary, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of Panama's Battalion - 2000 squad, was personally supervised *-2001 by Gen. Noriega, says 0 *T*-1 a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports.
*PRO*-2 Leaping into rages, *PRO*-2 sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved * in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City.
He is now changing the place 0 he sleeps *T*-1 every night, sometimes more than once a night.
His meals are most often prepared by women 0 he trusts *T*-1--his full - time mistress, Vicky Amado, and her mother, Norma.
And he is collecting the names of those who *T*-1 telephoned the coup - makers *PRO*-2 to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters.
More enemies 0 *T*-1 to be dealt with *-2.
In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed *T*-1, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal - and efficient - in *PRO*-2 maintaining power.
Yet, while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that *T*-1 stretches back three decades.
America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship.
Before American foreign policy set out *PRO*-1 to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates.
For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience.
In 1960, for example, when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy - in - training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency *T*-1, he was detained *-3 by Lima authorities for *PRO* allegedly raping *RNR*-2 and savagely beating *RNR*-2 a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.
The woman had nearly died.
But U.S. intelligence, rather than *PRO* rein in *RNR*-3 or cut loose *RNR*-3 its new spy, merely filed the report away.
Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed *-1 more important to U.S. interests.
From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of *PRO* overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures.
The U.S. has befriended *RNR*-4 and later turned against *RNR*-4 many dictators, but none quite so resourceful.
The 55 - year - old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well - born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.
Yet he has proved *-1 more resilient than any of them.
And out of necessity: The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope *PRO*-1 to remove him from power, but a single error on his part could cost him his life.
"The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along," says *T*-1 Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama.
"He has mastered the art of survival."
In *PRO* keeping with America's long history of *PRO* propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.
Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation, says 0 *?* Mr. Moss, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement.
"If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing, he might not have made it through 1988," Mr. Moss contends *T*-1.
Perhaps most important, Mr. Noriega's allies have intervened *PRO*-1 to encourage *RNR*-2--in some cases, to demand *RNR*-2--that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne.
One Colombian drug boss, upon *PRO* hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. *PRO*-1 to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand - sized mahogany coffin engraved * with his name.
"He is cornered," says *T*-2 the Rev. Fernando Guardia, who *T*-1 has led Catholic Church opposition against Noriega.
"The Americans have left him without a way out.
It *EXP*-6 is easy *PRO* to fight when you don't have any other option *T*-1."
His chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses.
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos, who *T*-1 have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation.
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima *T*-1, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.
The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega's half - brother, a Panamanian diplomat based * in Peru named * *PRO*-1 Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.
Luis Carlos, *PRO*-2 knowing that *PRO* helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies 0 he observed *T*-1 among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.
A spy was born *-1.
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega, who *T*-2 was known *-1 to his friends as Cara la Pina--pineapple face.
*PRO*-1 Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised *-1 on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate.
He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom *T*-1 were wayward sons sent * by their well - off families to the highly disciplined, French - modeled academy as a sort of reform school.
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French - made uniform, Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life, friends from the period say 0 *T*-1.
"He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism *T*-2, where officers were the elite with special privileges *T*-1," recalls *T*-3 Darien Ayala, a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend.
Mr. Noriega's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967, intelligence officials say 0 *T*-1.
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service.
The spy network would serve two clients *NOT*: the Panamanian government, by *PRO* monitoring political opponents in the region, and the U.S., by *PRO* tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized * at United Fruit Co.'s banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.
*PRO* Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader.
Mr. Noriega's initial retainer was only $50 *U* to $100 *U* a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX, a former intelligence official says 0 *T*-1.
It was modest pay by American standards, but a healthy boost to his small military salary, which fellow officers remember *T*-1 as *PRO*-2 having been $300 *U* to $400 *U* monthly.
"He did it very well," recalls *T*-2 Boris Martinez, a former Panamanian colonel who *T*-1 managed Mr. Noriega and his operation.
"He started building the files that *T*-1 helped him *PRO*-2 gain power."
A National Guard job assumed * by Capt. Noriega in 1964--as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province--was tailor - made for an aspiring super-spy.
By *PRO*-2 pressuring taxi and bus drivers who *T*-1 needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information.
He knew which local luminaries *T*-4 had been caught *-1 *PRO*-5 driving drunk, which *T*-3 had been found *-2 with their mistresses.
This proved *-3 particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967, when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared 0 *T*-1 could turn violent *T*-2.
Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy.
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed *T*-3 throughout the banana - exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which *T*-2 was ruled *-1 by United Fruit Co.
The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier 0 *PRO* to control *T*-1.
"It was like a play on Broadway," recalls *T*-1 Mr. Martinez.
"Noriega managed the whole thing.
He was superb.
Noriega was an expert at *PRO* bribing and blackmailing people."
During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.
Rodrigo Miranda, a local lawyer and human - rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David, where he had his offices *T*-1.
Mr. Noriega would order them all *PRO*-1 to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, *PRO* laughing at them and then retreating to his office.
"People started wondering if something was wrong with him," Mr. Miranda recalls *T*-1.
But through this period, so far as the U.S. military was concerned *-1, Mr. Noriega was a model recruit.
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details 0 Mr. Noriega has since classified *T*-1 as secret.
He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, *PRO* returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two - month course called * *PRO*-1 "military intelligence for officers."
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely.
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G - 2 in 1970 after *PRO* providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support *PRO* to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.
He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.
Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts *PRO*-2 to include the Cubans--not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that *T*-1 came knocking.
When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting *T*-1, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans.
"Early on in the State Department, we took to *PRO* calling him *PRO*-4 the *PRO* rent - a - colonel, in tribute to his ability *PRO* to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States," recalls *T*-1 Francis J. McNeil, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, *T*-2 first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977 *T*-3.
"Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans *T*-1 *T*-2."
Even at this early stage, drugs caused additional concerns.
During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G - 2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.
One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for *PRO* dealing with Col. Noriega, one of which *T*-1 was assassination.
The head of the DEA at the time, John Ingersoll, scotched the assassination plan.
But he did fly to Panama *PRO*-1 to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including Mr. Noriega.
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed *-1 afraid *PRO* to act on the concerns of the U.S. .
"Everybody was afraid of him," Mr. Ingersoll says *T*-1.
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group *T*-1.
The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos's own phone, according to American intelligence officials.
"We caught him with his hands on our cookie jar," says *T*-1 former CIA Director Stansfield Turner.
For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll--and the deliberations were intense, Mr. Turner says 0 *T*-1.
"In the world of intelligence, if you want *PRO*-1 to get information, you get it from seedy characters.
The question is how much you get tied *-2 in with seedy characters so they can extort you *T*-1."
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others.
Mr. Turner was troubled *-1 enough *PRO* to cancel the U.S. contract with the *PRO* rent - a - colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration.
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern: gun - running.
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of *PRO* illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying *PRO* to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.
They included one of Mr. Noriega's closest friends and business partners, Carlos Wittgreen.
And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself.
At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy.
Mr. Noriega made plans *PRO* to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon.
Dade County and federal authorities, *PRO*-1 learning that he intended *PRO*-2 to fly through Miami, made plans *PRO* to arrest him on the gun - running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.
It was a Friday in June.
The Pentagon foiled the plan.
According to military officers at the time, word *ICH*-1 was passed *-2 to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting.
On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama.
"Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega has elected *PRO*-1 to postpone his visit to Washington," it read *T*-2.
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback.
Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed *-1 on a technicality.
But now, along with *PRO*-2 reindicting Mr. Noriega's pal, they intended *PRO*-2 to charge Mr. Noriega himself, on allegations that he was involved *-1 in the illegal trading of some $2 million *U* in arms.
In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned *-1 to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned * to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.
Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told *-1 0 *?*, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.
Mr. Sanford was told *-1 0 Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security.
It *EXP*-1 wouldn't be a good idea *PRO* to indict him *NOT*--much less Mr. Noriega, the prosecutor was told *-2 0 *T*-3.
After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington *PRO* to let the indictment proceed.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote 0 *?* in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting *PRO*-2 to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught *-2 between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control *T*-1."
The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death.
"I think 0 if we had been allowed *-3 to go ahead then we wouldn't have the problems 0 we have *T*-1 now," Mr. Sanford says *T*-2.
"If he had been found *-1 guilty, we could have stopped him."
In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General *RNR*-2 and de-facto dictator *RNR*-2 of Panama, *PRO* having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.
Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses.
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G - 2 back on the U.S. payroll.
Payments *ICH*-3 averaged nearly $200,000 *U* a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA.
Although *PRO*-1 working for U.S. intelligence, Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively.
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas.
He allegedly entered into Panama's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to Floyd Carlton, a pilot who *T*-1 once worked for Mr. Noriega and who *T*-2 testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that *T*-3 would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges.
But Mr. Noriega was convinced *-5 0 the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him, recalls 0 *?* his close ally Jose Blandon, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
Mr. Blandon says 0 the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.
And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.
Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited *-1, it was enough *PRO* to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration, says 0 *T*-3 Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who *T*-2 then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
"Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin," he says *T*-1.
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington *T*-1--by *PRO* compromising U.S. officials.
Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls *PRO*-2 being invited *-1 to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the Aswara Peninsula.
Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation.
"Briggs screamed," Mr. Windsor recalls *T*-1.
He says 0 Mr. Briggs told him 0 he was being set up *-1 for a "honey trap," in which Mr. Noriega would try *PRO*-2 to involve him in an orgy and then record the event "with sound and video *T*-3."
Mr. Briggs, on vacation after *PRO* resigning his position at the National Security Council, couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt *PRO* to curry more favor in Washington.
For instance, he helped steal the May 1984 Panamanian elections for the ruling party.
But just one month later, he also contributed $100,000 *U* to a Contra leader, according to documents released * for Oliver North's criminal trial in Washington, D.C.
Yet, his political setbacks mounted.
Mr. Noriega was accused *-1 of *PRO*-1 ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man 0 *T*-2 to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges.
He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S., after Mr. Barletta tried *PRO*-1 to create a commission *PRO* to investigate the murder.
And, all the while, Panama's debt problems continued *-1 to grow.
Mr. Noriega was growing desperate.
In late 1986, he made an offer 0 he thought 0 the U.S. couldn't refuse *T*-1.
As *PRO* recounted *-4 in a stipulation that *T*-1 summarized government documents released * for the North trial, Mr. Noriega offered *PRO*-2 to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange "for a promise *PRO* to help *PRO* clean up Noriega's image and a commitment *PRO* to lift the {U.S. .} ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces."
"North," the document went on *T*-2, *PRO*-1 referring to Oliver North, "has told Noriega's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions.
The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as Noriega had helped {the U.S. .} the previous year in *PRO* blowing up a Sandinista arsenal."
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, who *T*-1 relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz.
Mr. Noriega's proposal was turned *-1 down.
And Mr. Shultz curtly told Mr. Abrams that the general should be told *-1 that only he could repair his tarnished image.
The end of the marriage was at hand.
Within weeks the unfolding Iran - Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega's insurance policy.
The death of CIA Director William Casey and resignation of Oliver North allowed anti-Noriega political forces to gain influence.
Public protests against him were triggered *-1 in June 1987 due to charges *ICH*-2 by Diaz Herrera, his former chief of staff, that Mr. Noriega had stolen the 1984 election and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos.
Few American officials were willing any longer *PRO*-1 to defend him.
Lawyers in Miami--*PRO*-1 this time working virtually without impediment--prepared *PRO*-1 to have him indicted *-2 on drug charges in February 1988.
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals *PRO* to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation, Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped *T*-1 for so many years, could turn against him *T*-2.
Now, neither side--the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega--has an easy out.
President Bush has sworn *PRO*-1 to bring him to justice.
Mr. Noriega believes 0 he hasn't any alternative but *PRO* to continue clutching to power.
It is a knock - out battle--perhaps to the death.
In the end, is Mr. Noriega the political equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, created * by a well - intentioned but misguided foreign power?
Not quite, Sen. Leahy contends 0 *T*-1.
"For short - term gains, people were willing *PRO* to put up with him.
That allowed him to get stronger and stronger," he says *T*-1.
"I don't think 0 we created him as much as we fed him, nurtured him and let him grow up *PRO* to be big and strong.
Sandoz AG, a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group, said that its group sales rose 25% to 9.482 billion francs ($5.80 billion *U*) in the first nine months of this year, with strong gains in all divisions.
A year earlier sales totaled 7.567 billion francs.
Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period, although the company didn't provide figures, 0 as *T*-1 is customary with Swiss companies.
Sandoz said 0 it expects a "substantial increase" in consolidated profit for the full year, *PRO* barring major currency rate changes.
Markets usually get *PRO*-1 noticed because they soar or plunge.
Gold, which *T*-1 hasn't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time, yesterday achieved what *T*-2 may be a new level of impassiveness: The most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market.
The settlement prices of the December, February and April gold contracts were even with Monday's final prices.
The December 1989 contract, which *T*-1 has the greatest trading volume, ended at $371.20 *U* an ounce.
The other months posted advances of 10 cents to 20 cents an ounce.
According to one analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber, New York, the stock market's ability *ICH*-2 on Monday *PRO* to rally from last Friday's decline--which *T*-1 seemed *-3 to indicate that the economy wasn't going *PRO* to fall either--took the starch out of precious metals prices, and out of gold's, in particular.
Yesterday, gold traded within a narrow range.
Gold tried *PRO*-3 to rally on Monday but ran into the same situation that *T*-1 has subdued gold prices for more than a year: *PRO* selling by gold producers, who *T*-2 want *PRO*-4 to fix the highest possible price for their gold.
"December delivery gold is trading in a range of $365 to $375 *U* {an ounce} and is having difficulty *PRO* breaking out above that," Mr. Savaiko said *T*-1.
"Producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which *PRO* to sell gold *T*-1."
Also, Mr. Savaiko noted *?*, stock market investors seeking greater safety are veering toward *PRO* buying bonds rather than precious metals because "we are tending more toward a disinflationary economy that *T*-1 doesn't make gold and precious metals attractive."
Jeffrey Nichols, president of APMS Canada, Toronto precious metals advisers, said 0 there is little 0 *T*-1 to motivate gold traders to buy the metal.
"Investors in the U.S. and Europe are comfortable with the actions of the {Federal Reserve} in its willingness *PRO* to supply liquidity to financial system, which *T*-1 helped the stock market rebound on Monday," he said *T*-2.
There isn't any rush on the part of investors in the West *PRO* to buy gold, he said 0 *T*-1.
"They still bear the memory of October 1987, when they bought gold after the stock market crashed and ended up *PRO*-2 losing money because gold prices subsequently fell *T*-3," Mr. Nichols said *T*-1.
"It's an experience 0 they don't want *PRO*-2 to repeat *T*-1."
At the moment gold traders aren't concerned about inflation, he said *T*-1, and as for the dollar, "gold's association with the currency has been diminishing recently so drops in the currency aren't having much impact on gold."
Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank, said: "There is little incentive on the part of traders 0 *PRO* to sell gold *T*-1 because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its ` flight to safety' quality.
There is little incentive 0 *PRO* to buy gold *T*-1 because if the stock market goes higher, it may be just a false alarm.
This is keeping the gold traders *PRO*-1 handcuffed."
The most remarkable feature about yesterday's action was that the price of roughly $370 *U* an ounce was regarded *-1 as attractive enough by gold producers around the world *PRO* to aggressively sell gold, Mr. Mehta said *T*-2.
"I don't know what it means *T*-1 over the long run, but for the short term, it appears that gold producers are grateful for the $10 *U* or so that gold has risen *T*-2 over the past week or so," he said *T*-3.
Previously, he noted *?*, gold producers tended *-1 to back off from a rising gold market, *PRO* letting prices rise as much as possible before *PRO* selling.
Mr. Mehta observed that the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which *T*-1 rose sharply in August, according to yesterday's report, has been having less and less impact on the gold market.
"The dollar hasn't reacted much to it, so gold hasn't *?* either," he said *T*-1.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
ENERGY:
Crude oil prices rose slightly in lackluster activity as traders in the pits tried *PRO*-1 to assess action in the stock market.
Since stock market indexes plummeted last Friday, participants in all markets have been wary.
When traders become confident that the stock market has stabilized *T*-1, oil prices are expected *-2 to rise as supply and demand fundamentals once again become the major consideration.
Crude oil for November delivery edged up by 16 cents a barrel to $20.75 *U* a barrel.
Heating oil prices also rose.
November gasoline slipped slightly.
SUGAR:
Futures prices rose on a report that Cuba may seek *PRO*-1 to postpone some sugar shipments.
The March contract advanced 0.14 cent a pound to 14.11 cents.
According to an analyst, Cuba can't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked Japan *PRO*-1 to accept a delay of shipments scheduled * for later this year, into early next year.
"Japan is perceived *-1 as a wealthy nation that *T*-2 can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar," the analyst said *T*-3.
It was the possibility of this demand that *T*-1 helped firm prices, the analyst said *T*-2.
Another analyst noted that Cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years.
"To the professionals in the trade it didn't cause much surprise.
The March futures contract traded as high as 14.24 cents, but couldn't sustain the advance," he said *T*-1.
LIVESTOCK AND MEATS:
The prices of cattle, hogs and pork belly futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the Friday stock market plunge would chill consumer spending, which *T*-1 in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork.
The prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply Monday.
Cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans *PRO* to increase their promotions concerning beef.
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS:
The prices of most soybean and soybean - meal futures contracts rose amid rumors that the Soviet Union is interested *-1 in *PRO* buying from the U.S. or South America about 250,000 metric tons of soybeans and as many as 400,000 metric tons of soybean meal.
Traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible U.S. soybean sales because U.S. exports are lagging.
Since Sept. 1, about 13 million fewer bushels of U.S. soybeans *ICH*-1 have been sold *-3 overseas than for the same period last year.
Corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed.
NEWSPAPERS:
Media General Inc. intends *PRO*-2 to sell two of its West Coast weekly newspaper chains, Golden West Publishing Inc. and Highlander Publications, which *T*-1 together comprise 31 papers.
Media General said 0 it has had inquiries from potential buyers and expects *PRO*-1 to complete a sale in 1989.
It wouldn't discuss a price.
Lee Dirks & Associates is *-1 to sell the chains.
The oil and auto industries, united * in their dislike of President Bush's proposal for cars that *T*-1 run on alternative fuels, announced a joint research program that *T*-2 could turn up a cleaner - burning gasoline.
Officials of the Big Three auto makers and 14 petroleum companies said 0 they are setting out *PRO*-1 to find the most cost - effective fuel for *PRO* reducing cities' air - pollution problems, with no bias toward any fuel in particular.
However, their search notably won't include natural gas or pure methanol--the two front - running alternative fuels--in tests 0 *T*-2 to be completed *-3 by next summer.
Instead, the tests will focus heavily on new blends of gasoline, which *T*-1 are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting *T*-3 as a solution for automobile pollution that *T*-2 is choking urban areas.
Environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public - relations attempt *PRO* to head off a White House proposal *PRO* to require a million cars a year that *T*-1 run on cleaner - burning fuels by 1997.
While major oil companies have been experimenting with cleaner - burning gasoline blends for years, only Atlantic Richfield Co. is now marketing a lower - emission gasoline for older cars currently running on leaded fuel.
The initial $11 million *U* research program will conduct the most extensive *ICH*-1 testing to date of reformulated gasolines, said 0 *T*-2 Joe Colucci, head of fuels and lubricants at General Motors Corp. research laboratories.
It will compare 21 different blends of gasolines with three mixtures of up to 85% methanol.
A second phase of research, which *T*-2 is still being planned *-1, will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars.
There was no cost estimate for the second phase.
"The whole idea here is 0 the automobile and oil companies have joint customers," said *T*-1 Keith McHenry, a senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp.
"And we are looking for the most cost - effective way 0 *PRO* to clean up the air *T*-1."
But David Hawkins, an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said 0 the research appears merely *-1 to be a way 0 *PRO* to promote reformulated gasoline *T*-2.
Oil and auto companies supported a move *ICH*-1 on Capitol Hill last week *PRO* to gut Mr. Bush's plans *PRO* to require auto makers to begin *-2 selling alternative - fueled cars by 1995.
Instead, a House subcommittee adopted a clean - fuels program that *T*-1 specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative.
The Bush administration has said 0 it will try *PRO*-1 to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean - air bill *T*-3.
HUGO'S BLAST generates pleas for aid from South Carolina small businesses.
The Small Business Administration has received more than 5,000 formal requests for disaster loans because of the hurricane.
About 45% of requests for SBA relief loans, which *T*-1 also are available to homeowners, come from small businesses, compared with a 25% business share after most disasters.
The SBA expects *PRO*-1 to make about $1 billion *U* in Hurricane Hugo loans.
The disaster fund is replenished *-1 by loan repayments.
Hardest hit by Hugo in South Carolina were *T*-1 small retailers tied * to the tourist industry and businesses in agriculture and cultivated seafood.
The State Development Board set up a Hugo Hotline *PRO* to accept business - to - business help.
After NBC weather man Willard Scott broadcast the hot - line number, it was flooded *-1 with 10,000 calls.
Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce began *-1 using its national TV show *PRO* to seek help, such as equipment, for business owners.
Local bankers and accountants help applicants fill out forms.
"It helps us, and people feel better *PRO* talking to someone who *T*-1's gone through the same thing," an SBA official says *T*-2.
HEALTH BENEFITS remain a central lobbying effort, even as Section 89 fades.
The Senate, after *PRO* deleting Section 89 repeal from its deficit - reduction bill, still is expected *-2 to join the House in *PRO* voting *PRO*-3 to kill the law, which *T*-1 forces companies *PRO*-4 to provide comparable benefits to laborers and executives alike.
In *PRO* lobbying on other health - coverage topics, the National Federation of Independent Business will press for legislation that *T*-1 would give self - employed people a 100% tax deduction for their own health plans, up from 25% currently.
And the group will urge that the federal government pre-empt state rules on what *T*-2 must be covered *-1 by employers' health insurance.
Small - business groups also will fight the medical - leave provision of legislation that *T*-1 would expand parental leaves.
And they still oppose as too costly an employer - paid health insurance bill sponsored * by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass .) despite his proposal *PRO* to phase in small business only gradually.
There is also worry that the Pepper Commission studying long - term health care will again push lawmakers toward employerpaid solutions.
The Section 89 victory could have a downside by *PRO* making it *EXP*-1 harder *PRO* to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals.
"With the repeal of Section 89, we can no longer say 0 they're discouraging businesses from *PRO* offering health plans," says *T*-1 Christine Russell, the Chamber of Commerce's small - business advocate.
*PRO* JUMPING THE GUN:
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) was outraged after a private word to John Motley, lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Business, resulted in a news release saying that the Senate Finance Committee chairman would recommend repeal of Section 89.
Even though the announcement was true in the end, it was issued *-1 without the senator's permission.
"I blew it," Mr. Motley says *T*-1 apologetically.
"It was a timing mistake."
PRISON - SHOP BLUES:
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C .) protests pending legislation *PRO* to end the preference that the federal prison system gets *T*-1 in *PRO* selling prisoner - made furniture and other goods to government agencies.
Small - business suppliers want prisons to stop *-1 getting high priority, especially as prison production grows with swelling inmate populations.
Last year, the prisons' sales to the Pentagon totaled $336 million *U*.
REPAIR SHOPS SCRAP for more access to work on auto - emissions systems.
Groups representing some independent auto - repair shops join a compromise on the Clean Air legislation worked out between environmentalists and Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif .).
The plan would increase the warranty on auto - emission systems to eight years or 80,000 miles from five years or 50,000 for major parts.
But the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered *-1 to two years or 24,000 miles.
The garage owners say 0 they would benefit because car owners would be less likely *PRO* to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years.
The repair shops aren't united, however.
Shops represented * by the Automotive Service Industry Association and the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association oppose any increase in warranty length.
They say 0 the longer the warranty, the longer customers will automatically return to new - car dealers, which *T*-1 then find non-warranty work that *T*-2 might otherwise go to repair shops.
The House Energy Committee will debate the issue later this month.
Stan Hathcock, an Atlanta garage owner who *T*-1 opposes a longer warranty, estimates that the current plan costs him as much as $15,000 *U* a year in lost business.
SMALL TALK:
Some 70% of graduates who *T*-3 recently earned an M.B.A. degree say 0 they'd prefer *PRO*-1 to work in *RNR*-2 or own *RNR*-2 a small company, yet most take jobs with large concerns, says 0 *T*-4 a survey by the Foster McKay Group, a New York recruiting firm....
Cardinal Scientific Inc. of Waldorf, Md., seeks a Small Business Innovation Research grant 0 *PRO* to produce a "nozzle assembly for an Army mass delousing outfit *T*-1.
Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., said 0 it received approval *ICH*-2 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration *PRO* to market a genetic test that *T*-1 will assist in diagnosis and treatment of leukemia and lymph cancer.
The B / T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for *PRO* diagnosing the type of cancer, whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment, said 0 *T*-1 Oncor President Stephen Turner.
Mr. Turner said 0 the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests, but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis.
Mr. Turner said 0 the test will be shipped *-1 in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories.
Dr. Wyndham Wilson, a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute, said 0 the test is widely used in research centers but isn't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in *PRO* choosing the most effective treatment.
But the test may prove *-1 to be more sensitive in *PRO* determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment, Dr. Wilson said 0 *T*-2.
"We don't know yet how useful it's going *PRO* to be *T*-2," he said *T*-1.
Oncor, a six - year - old developer of genetic medical tests, projects that the cancer test will help it *PRO* to post its first - ever profit during the first quarter of 1990, Mr. Turner said 0 *T*-1.
The company will charge $35 *U* for a test and projects about $2 million *U* in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing, he said 0 *T*-1.
The days *ICH*-2 may be numbered *-1 for animated shows featuring Alf, the Karate Kid and the Chipmunks.
NBC, a leader in morning, prime - time and late night programs but an also - ran on Saturday mornings, when children rule the TV set *T*-1, is contemplating *PRO*-2 getting out of the cartoon business.
Instead, network officials say 0 *?*, it may "counterprogram" with shows for an audience that *T*-1 is virtually ignored *-2 in that time period: adults.
"There is talk of some revamping and we're certainly heading in the direction of less and less animation," said *T*-1 Joseph S. Cicero, vice president of finance and administration for National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.
Mr. Cicero said that NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff, who *T*-2 declined *PRO*-3 to be interviewed *-1, is "looking at options now and may put some things into the schedule by mid-season."
He declined *PRO*-1 to elaborate.
NBC's options could range from news - oriented programming to sports shows, although the network declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
One major NBC affiliate, KCRA in Sacramento, plans *PRO*-1 to cancel the NBC Saturday morning line - up as of January and replace it with a local newscast.
The one - hour program will be repeated *-1 with updates throughout Saturday mornings.
"We feel 0 there is an opportunity for an audience that *T*-2 is not being served *-1 by any network, so we want *PRO* to take the lead," says *T*-3 KCRA's general manager, John Kueneke.
"We don't need cartoons anymore.
They only accounted for 5%, at best, of the station's total revenues."
An NBC spokesman says 0 the network will "closely monitor" the Sacramento situation, and says 0 it is the only station 0 *T*-1 to defect.
Spokesmen for the television networks of CBS Inc. and Capital Cities / ABC Inc., say 0 there are no plans *PRO* to alter the children's line - up on Saturday mornings.
The youthful audience for Saturday programming is no longer dependent on the networks.
There has been a surge in syndicated children's shows to independent stations, as well as competition from videocassettes for kids and from cable outlets such as Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel.
At the same time, there appears *PRO* to be a market for news - oriented programming; Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network has its highest ratings, outside of prime time, on Saturday mornings.
NBC has on previous occasions considered replacing cartoons with a Saturday version of "Today," which *T*-2 is produced *-1 by NBC News.
The network's own production company, NBC Productions, supplies a half - hour family - oriented show titled *PRO* "*PRO*-1 *PRO* Saved By The Bell."
NBC Productions or NBC News could supply the network with other Saturday morning shows, a move that *T*-1 would control costs.
Animated shows, which *T*-2 are made *-1 by outside production companies, cost the network about $300,000 *U* per episode.
Robert J. Regal was named *-2 *PRO*-3 president *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of this company's Universal - Rundle Corp. unit.
Mr. Regal had been president *RNR*-2 and chief executive *RNR*-2 of RBS Industries Inc.
Robert H. Carlson, previous president and chief executive of Universal - Rundle, will assume the title of chairman of the unit, a vitreous - china maker.
Hachette S.A., a European media and publishing group, reported a small rise in its attributable first - half group profit, excluding exceptional items, to 133.8 million francs ($21.1 million *U*) from 130.1 million francs a year earlier.
The Paris - based group said 0 its earlier projection--that group profit for all of 1989 would be close to the 322.7 million francs posted * for 1988--remains valid.
*PRO* Taking into account nonrecurring gains and losses, Hachette's group net income for the first six months of this year totaled 246.6 million francs, practically double the year - earlier figure of 124.5 million francs.
Analysts said 0 Hachette's earnings in the second half might be boosted *-1 by a capital gain from the sale of the Paris headquarters of a newspaper - delivery company that *T*-3 is 49% owned *-2 by Hachette.
Control Data Corp., Minneapolis, signed a joint development agreement *ICH*-1 with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. *PRO* to incorporate an emerging computing architecture in future machines.
MIPS is a leader in what *T*-2 is known *-1 as reduced - instruction set computing, or RISC, a technology combining microprocessors and sophisticated software.
In *PRO* joining MIPS, Control Data follows several competitors in *PRO* embracing RISC as a new design approach.
Digital Equipment Corp., Tandem Computers Inc., NEC Corp. and Group Bull, among others, have similar arrangements with MIPs, based * in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Control Data said 0 it expects its first RISC - based mainframe machine *PRO* to be introduced *-1 next year.
The accord with MIPS calls for Control Data to share its expertise in data storage, the companies said 0 *T*-1.
Control Data also said 0 it is developing what it called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 a "supermainframe" computer, the Cyber 2000, intended * for scientists, engineers and other users of generalpurpose high - performance computers.
H. Anthony Ittleson was elected *-1 *PRO*-3 a director of this company, which *T*-2 primarily has interests in radio and television stations, *PRO* increasing the number of seats to five.
Osborn also operates Muzak franchises, entertainment properties and small cable - television systems.
Mr. Ittleson is executive, special projects, at CIT Group Holdings Inc., which *T*-2 is controlled *-1 by Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
Frank Carlucci III was named *-1 to this telecommunications company's board, *PRO* filling the vacancy created * by the death of William Sobey last May.
Mr. Carlucci, 59 years old, served as defense secretary in the Reagan administration.
In January, he accepted the position of vice chairman of Carlyle Group, a merchant banking concern.
Moody's Investors Service Inc., *PRO* fretting about increasing competitive pressure on Ryder, placed about $2.8 billion *U* in company securities under review for possible downgrade.
Ratings under review are Ryder's A - 1 collateral trust debentures, A - 2 senior notes and bonds, A - 2 preferred stock and the company's Prime - 1 rating for commercial paper.
Moody's said 0 it is assessing the strategies 0 Ryder's management may follow *T*-1 in *PRO* addressing significant challenges in some major markets.
The rating agency said 0 it is focusing especially on the transportation service company's efforts *PRO* to control costs, improve margins and enhance its competitive position in its primary business, vehicle leasing and rental.
An unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap for August dragged the dollar *PRO*-2 lower Tuesday, but profit - taking on short positions helped the currency rebound *PRO*-1 to close mixed against major counterparts.
While the market kept careful tabs on Wall Street's gyrations, it shrugged off a modest downturn in equities *PRO* to bid the dollar well above the day's lows.
Soon after the release of the U.S. trade figures, the dollar plunged to an intraday low of 140.95 yen.
It also declined against the mark but *PRO* didn't reach its intraday low of 1.8435 marks until two hours later.
The unit stabilized about midday New York time at around 1.85 marks and 141 yen, *PRO* prompting unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve had intervened *PRO*-1 to blunt the unit's tumble.
The dollar finished at its intraday highs.
Dealers noted that the foreign exchange market's initial bearish reaction to the U.S. trade figures was tempered *-1 later by a "calmer reassessment of the data."
The U.S. Commerce Department reported a $10.77 billion *U* deficit in August, compared with a revised July deficit of $8.24 billion *U*.
Economists had expected a $9.1 billion *U* gap.
The August figure reflected a 6.4% rise in imports and a 0.2% drop in exports.
Marc M. Goloven, an economist with Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York, said that while the figures appear *-1 to indicate a sadly deteriorating U.S. trade performance, there's still enough positive news *ICH*-2 in the data *PRO* to justify *PRO* buying dollars.
He said that while the U.S. trade gap with Canada has widened significantly, the trade deficit with Western Europe and Japan continues *-1 to narrow.
And he added that manufactured goods exports are still rising.
The dollar's near - term path remains foggy, according to currencny analysts, who *T*-1 characterize the market as "bewildering."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted *-1 at 1.8667 marks, down from 1.8685 marks late Monday, and at 142.75 yen, up from 141.85 yen late Monday.
Sterling was unchanged at $1.5753 *U*.
In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 142.55 yen, unchanged from Tuesday's Tokyo close.
Later, the U.S. currency fell to about 142.25 yen on news reports of the San Francisco earthquake.
Some analysts remain bullish and point out that the dollar continues *-1 to be well bid despite key rate increases in Europe and Japan, several weeks of aggressive dollar sales by the world central banks--some traders estimate that the barrage of sales topped $12 billion *U*--and a 190 - point plunge on the New York Stock Exchange.
They note that the U.S. unit is trading at the upper end of the presumed target zones established * by the Group of Seven trading partners.
The G - 7 comprises West Germany, the U.S., France, the U.K., Italy, Canada and Japan.
The so - called Louvre accord was seen *-1 to have set ranges of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks and 120 yen to 140 yen.
They say that the recent injection of liquidity into the U.S. banking system has been modest, and they don't anticipate significant easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The Fed arranged $1.5 billion *U* of customer repurchase agreements Tuesday, the second repurchase agreement in two days.
The move, which *T*-2 injects capital into the system, is seen *-1 as an effort *PRO* to reassure the finanicial markets that the U.S. central bank is ready *PRO* to provide the ample liquidity.
But other analysts contend that while the Fed's move *PRO* to loosen credit hasn't been aggressive, it nevertheless sends a clear signal that, at least for now, the Fed has relaxed its grip on credit.
They add that the Fed has allowed the key federal funds interest rate *PRO*-1 to dip to about 8 5/8% from its levels of just below 9% last week.
The federal funds rate is the overnight lending rate that banks charge each other *T*-1.
Market participants said that the mark continues *-1 to post the most significant gains against the dollar.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $367.40 *U* an ounce, up 10 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was at $366.55 *U* an ounce.
Nothing stirred the soul of Ronald Reagan and his disciples as much as the crusade *PRO* to aid Nicaragua's Contra rebels, or the dream of *PRO* building a space - based defense shield *PRO* to knock out Soviet nuclear missiles.
Yet under Mr. Reagan's preferred successor, President Bush, those two cherished national - security causes are withering on the vine.
And, surprisingly, little more than a whimper of protest is being heard *-1, even though Reaganauts once breathed fire *PRO* supporting the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
"The programs have arthritis," says *T*-1 Rep. Henry Hyde, a conservative Republican from Illinois.
Yet, he asserts, "you look around...and you say, ` Who *T*-1 are the leaders?
Who *T*-1 is going *-2 to carry the water?"'
It *EXP*-1 isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade *PRO* to pump up the Contras or SDI.
Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was *?*.
What *T*-1's surprising is that there isn't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national - priority list.
A combination of factors--a weariness among some conservatives, a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues--seem *-1 to explain the strange tranquility.
Above all, though, conservative Republicans who *T*-1 have championed both the Contras and SDI are reluctant *PRO* to attack a Republican president for *PRO* failing *-2 to do more--though that reluctance may be receding.
"We want *PRO*-5 to complain, we want *PRO*-4 to say something about it, and we're going *-3 to *?* as it gets worse," says *T*-2 Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who *T*-1 has been a staunch Contra backer.
"But it's like *PRO* kicking your father in the pants.
You hate *PRO*-1 to do it because he's your father."
Mr. Burton says 0 conservatives' unhappiness with Mr. Bush's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing *PRO* to speak out.
Of course, neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI.
Mr. Bush has struck a deal *ICH*-2 with congressional leaders *PRO* to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February.
But the administration has dropped any effort *PRO* to win military aid for the rebels.
And the administration's deal with Congress gives several congressional committees the right *PRO* to cut off even humanitarian aid next month, though the committees are likely *PRO* to let aid continue until February.
Most analysts think 0 there's little prospect 0 the Contras can be a significant fighting force without U.S. arms, and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best.
Instead of *PRO* focusing on the Contras, Mr. Bush has switched to *PRO* urging members of Congress--most recently in a White House meeting yesterday--*PRO*-1 to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
The administration continues *-1 to support SDI, or Star Wars, and it recently lobbied *PRO*-2 to persuade the Senate *PRO*-3 to restore some of the funds 0 it planned *PRO*-5 to cut *T*-4 from the program.
And just last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney gave a strong speech listing "compelling reasons" 0 *PRO* to push ahead with SDI *T*-1 and saying 0 he'd urge President Bush *PRO*-2 to veto a defense bill with "inadequate" funding for the program.
But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late 0 *T*-1 to prevent damage to SDI.
The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding, and in the end the program's backers will be hard pressed *PRO* to head off some reduction in spending next year.
And while the defense secretary is speaking out, President Bush himself hasn't launched any high - visibility campaign *PRO* to drum up support, as President Reagan did *?*.
The administration also acknowledges that it isn't pursuing Mr. Reagan's original vision of an "impenetrable shield" protecting the whole U.S., but rather a more modest version.
*PRO*-2 More ominous to SDI supporters, the Bush administration appears *-2 to have tacitly accepted a new arms - control proposal from the Soviet Union that *T*-1 spells long - term trouble for Star Wars.
The Soviets have agreed *PRO*-1 to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without *PRO* including restrictions on space - based defenses.
But the Soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right *PRO* to withdraw from the completed strategic - arms treaty later on if the U.S. does SDI testing or deployment that the Soviets think 0 *T*-1 violates the existing anti-ballistic - missile treaty.
It will be hard *ICH*-1 down the road *PRO* to persuade Congress *PRO*-2 to approve money for SDI plans if lawmakers fear 0 those plans could scuttle a completed treaty.
As a result, Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan Pentagon aide who *T*-1 now heads the Center for Security Policy, charges that the administration's "professions of continued commitment to development and deployment of the SDI program strain credulity."
Still, proponents may be shying away from more drumbeating because they sense 0 political tides have turned against *PRO* arming the Nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on SDI--particularly when the public perceives 0 the Soviet threat is declining under Mikhail Gorbachev *T*-1.
In fact, because communism seems *-1 to be beating a global retreat, some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment *PRO* to push controversial programs.
"The short of it is that the most hard - bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing," says *T*-2 Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House aide who *T*-1 now is president of the Hudson Institute.
Some activists are toiling *PRO*-1 to raise the profile of the two causes.
But they say 0 they can't make much headway because of a lack of willing leaders in a position 0 *PRO* to turn the tide *T*-1.
One longtime champion of these programs in Congress, Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is distracted *-1 by questions about his ethics, conservatives note 0 *T*-2.
Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed *T*-1 with President Reagan.
Above all, though, proponents say 0 neither the Contra *RNR*-2 nor the SDI *RNR*-2 cause can be pushed *-1 much further without more presidential support.
"For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has *-1 to be blowing in the sails," says *T*-2 Rep. Burton.
All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way 0 *PRO* to drum up more enthusiasm *T*-1.
"What I'd like *PRO*-1 to see *T*-3, if he is up to it, is for Reagan to take to the hustings *PRO*-2 to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI," the congressman says.
A House - Senate conference approved an estimated $67 billion *U* fiscal 1990 spending bill that *T*-1 provides a 28% increase for space research and development and incorporates far - reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market.
The current ceiling on home loans insured * by the Federal Housing Administration would be increased *-1 to $124,875 *U*.
Separately, the bill gives authority *ICH*-1 to the Bush administration *PRO* to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low - income and moderate - income homeowners.
The second provision, affecting so - called 235 mortgages, has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented * by the Public Securities Association.
And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed * by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt *PRO* to strip the provision.
By an 11 - 2 margin, Senate negotiators voted *PRO*-1 to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan, and despite powerful allies, the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives.
The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11% under the 235 program, and however disruptive to private investors, the refinancing is expected *-1 to yield at least $15 million *U* in savings in fiscal 1990.
This sum has been guarded *-1 jealously by appropriators anxious *PRO* to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests.
"We are stewards here, not of the mortgage companies, but the taxpayers," said *T*-1 the Texas Republican.
The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $9 million *U* in assistance for elections scheduled * in Nicaragua in February.
The bulk of the money would be funneled *-1 through the National Endowment for Democracy, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged *-2 by questions regarding the money's true purpose and its ultimate destination.
The Senate had refused late Friday *PRO*-1 to invoke cloture and limit debate, but behind the bipartisan leadership, a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking *PRO* to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties.
Final approval--on a 64 - 35 roll call--was never in doubt, but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators, including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn.
The money will be applied *-1 for voter registration and election monitoring, but more than half is likely *PRO* to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party.
Critics warned 0 such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party's standing, and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party's funds must be shared *-1 with the government's Supreme Electoral Council.
Within the appropriations conference yesterday, the $67 billion *U* measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a disparate collection of accounts for science, housing, veterans and the environment.
The decision *PRO* to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House.
But it is driven *-1 by the same fiscal pressures that *T*-2 have forced lawmakers *PRO*-4 to resort to various bookkeeping devices *PRO* to juggle as much as $1 billion *U* in spending that *T*-3 would otherwise put the bill over budget.
These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991, and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects, including the first construction funds for the space station.
The station is promised *-1 $1.8 billion *U* within the $5.36 billion *U* provided * for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the nation's high - speed aerospace plane--cut * by the Senate--could receive as much as $60 million *U* in new funds or transfers.
Similarly, the House agreed *PRO*-1 to add back $62 million *U* *PRO* to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite, being developed by General Electric Co.
And while *PRO* setting a statutory limit of $1.6 billion *U* on the automated space probe, the conference appropriated $30 million *U* for the start - up of the CRAF - Cassini mission, a successor to the Voyager space probe.
Among major domestic agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency stands *PRO*-1 to receive increases significantly beyond those sought * by the administration, with pollution abatement and control accounts growing by 14% to about $829.9 million *U*.
An estimated $1.57 billion *U* is separately allocated *-3 for the National Science Foundation, and within the Housing and Urban Development Department, more than $9.2 billion *U* is provided *-1 for federally assisted housing, including an expanded effort *PRO* to modernize public housing units that *T*-2 serve the poorest families.
To an unusual degree, the massive bill has become a vehicle 0 for lawmakers to earmark funds for projects in home states *T*-1.
While the practice was discouraged *-1 in the past, the conference agreement is laced *-2 with veterans' hospitals, environmental projects and urban grants designated * for specific communities.
The most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds, where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued * at $20 million *U*, and the conference added 15 more valued * at $8 million *U* *PRO* to ostensibly preserve "balance" between the House and Senate *T*-1.
Yesterday's conference agreement is the second major bill 0 *T*-1 to emerge from negotiations this week, as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill *ICH*-3 late Monday that *T*-2 includes a sweeping ban on *PRO* smoking on most domestic airline flights.
An exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to Hawaii and Alaska, but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate 0 all but about 30 flights would be covered *-1.
Separately, a third conference report covering an $18.4 billion *U* Treasury and Postal Service bill was sent *-31 to the Senate after *PRO* passing the House on a 383 - 30 roll call yesterday.
And after weeks of delay, the appropriations process is beginning *-1 to take some final shape.
Defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration's standpoint.
And among domestic programs, the most serious threat is White House opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the District of Columbia and Department of Health and Human Services.
The same issue threatens *PRO*-2 to spill over to the foreign aid debate, and Mr. Bush also is threatening *PRO*-3 to veto any agreement that *T*-1 preserves Senate - passed provisions renewing U.S. support for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.
In a sharply written letter, Rep. David Obey, chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations, warned Mr. Bush that the result of his "ultimatum" could weaken efforts *PRO* to accommodate the administration elsewhere.
"As a result of your ultimatum," writes *?* the Wisconsin Democrat, "I guess 0 there is no longer any point in *PRO* taking administration views into account on other items in conference, inasmuch regardless of their resolution you apparently intend *PRO*-1 to veto this bill.
Industrial production declined 0.1% in September, *PRO* reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend.
The Federal Reserve Board said 0 output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of 1.3% in the third quarter, substantially slower than the 3.3% annual rate in the second quarter.
"Capital spending and exports, which *T*-1 have been the driving force in this expansion, are showing clear signs of *PRO* having the steam taken out of them," said *T*-2 Robert Dederick, economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
The new reports of sluggishness, which *T*-2 were foreshadowed *-1 by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September, give the Fed another reason *PRO* to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates.
"They need *-1 to do something about this," said *T*-2 Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Group Inc.
The Fed also said 0 U.S. industry operated at 83.6% of capacity last month, down from 83.8% in August.
Measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures.
Factory output dropped 0.2% *ICH*-1, its first decline since February, after *PRO* having been unchanged in October.
Factories operated at 83.7% of capacity, the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1% in September.
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods, those intended *PRO* to last more than three years.
The biggest drop was recorded *-1 by primary metals producers, a category that *T*-2 includes the steel industry.
Output of business equipment was unchanged in September.
Production of factory equipment, one indication of the strength of manufacturers' investment spending, fell 0.3%.
Some economists expect further declines in investment spending.
"Whenever corporate profits are weak *T*-1 that means 0 capital spending is going *-2 to soften subsequently," Mr. Harris said *T*-3.
"You haven't seen the full effect of that yet."
A decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto assemblies, the Fed noted 0 *T*-1.
Analysts don't expect the September surge in auto production to be repeated *-1 in the coming months.
Here is *T*-1 a summary of the Federal Reserve Board's report on industrial production in September.
The figures are seasonally adjusted *-1.
142.3% of the 1977 average.
The inverse trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted *-1 yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices.
But bond investors continue *-1 to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market.
In early trading, investors were bidding bond prices *PRO*-3 higher as stocks tumbled and fears *ICH*-1 mounted that Friday's stock market debacle would be repeated *-2.
But a partial recovery in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which *T*-1 had been down more than 60 points in midmorning, dashed those expectations.
Treasury bonds also were hurt *-1 late in the day by a $4 billion *U* offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt.
"Bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue *-1 to fall," said *T*-2 Roger Early, a vice president at Federated Investors Inc., Pittsburgh.
"When stocks stabilized *T*-1, that was a disappointment."
Meanwhile, for the second straight day, the bond market paid little attention to the Federal Reserve's open market operations.
Fed officials injected more cash into the banking system by *PRO* arranging $1.5 billion *U* of repurchase agreements during the usual pre-noon intervention period.
The move was meant *-1 to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence.
"The intervention has been friendly, *PRO* meaning that they really didn't have *-2 to do it," said *T*-1 Maria Fiorini Ramirez, money - market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
She said 0 a more aggressive move wasn't needed *-1.
The Fed also appears *-1 reluctant *PRO* to ease credit conditions further.
It already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline 1/4 percentage point to about 8 3/4% from its previous target level of about 9%.
The rate, which banks charge *T*-2 each other on overnight loans, is considered *-1 an early signal of changes in Fed policy.
It ended at about 8 11/16% yesterday, but was as low as 8 1/2% Monday.
The Treasury's benchmark 30 - year bond fell more than 1/2 point, or over $5 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, while the yield moved above 8% for the first time since Thursday.
Investment - grade corporate, municipal and mortgage - backed securities also fell.
But most junk bonds closed unchanged after *PRO* opening slightly higher on bargain - hunting by institutional investors.
Some so - called high - quality junk issues, such as R.H. Macy & Co.'s 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, rose.
The Macy's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of 97.
The TVA's public debt offering was its first in 15 years.
Strong investor demand prompted it *PRO*-1 to boost the size of the issue from $3 billion *U*.
Traders said 0 hedging related * to the TVA pricing also pressured Treasury bonds.
"Underwriters of the TVA bonds reduced their market risk by *PRO* selling Treasurys *PRO* to cover at least part of their {TVA} holdings," said *T*-1 James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
The TVA bonds also "served *PRO*-1 to remind the market that there will be even more new supply," said *T*-2 Lawrence N. Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg Securities & Co.
Today the Treasury will announce the size of its next two - year note sale and Resolution Funding Corp. will announce details of its first bond offering.
Some traders estimate 0 $9.75 billion *U* of new two - year Treasurys will be sold *-1 next week, and they expect Refcorp to offer $4 billion to $6 billion *U* of long - term "bailout" bonds.
Refcorp was created *-1 *PRO* to help fund the thrift bailout.
Another agency issue came to market yesterday.
The Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks said 0 it priced a four - part $2.27 billion *U* bond offering 0 for the banks to yield from 8.125% to 8.375% *U* *T*-1.
The release of several economic reports *ICH*-1 had little impact on the market, including a report that the U.S. trade deficit expanded to a surprisingly wide $10.77 billion *U* in August, up from a revised $8.24 billion *U* in July.
The August gap was expected *-1 to have expanded to $9.1 billion *U*.
Treasury Securities
Treasury securities were essentially flat to about 1/2 point lower.
The benchmark 30 - year bond was quoted *-1 late at 100 28/32 *PRO* to yield 8.04%, compared with 101 19/32 *PRO* to yield 7.97% Monday.
The latest 10 - year notes were quoted *-1 late at 99 25/32 *PRO* to yield 8.01%, compared with 100 1/32 *PRO* to yield 7.97%.
Short - term rates increased.
The discount rate on three - month bills rose to 7.52% for a bond - equivalent yield of 7.75%.
The rate on six - month bills rose to 7.53% for a bond - equivalent yield of 7.92%.
Corporate, Other Issues
Investment - grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 to 1/2 point lower, while most junk bonds ended unchanged.
The TVA's huge $4 billion *U* offering dominated attention in the new - issue market.
TVA offered $2 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds priced *PRO* to yield 9.06%; $1 billion *U* in 10 - year notes priced *PRO* to yield 8.42%; and $1 billion *U* in five - year notes priced *PRO* to yield 8.33%.
The TVA, which *T*-1 operates one of the nation's largest electric power systems, is a corporation wholly owned by the U.S. government.
Yesterday's bond sale was part of a $6.7 billion *U* refinancing plan *PRO* to pay off high - interest debt 0 the TVA owes the Federal Financing Bank, an arm of the Treasury *T*-1.
Meanwhile, Lockheed Corp. priced a $300 million *U* note offering *PRO* to yield 9.39%.
Mortgage - Backed Securities
The derivative mortgage - backed market revived after a brief hiatus as two new Remics totaling $850 million *U* were offered *-4 and talk *ICH*-3 circulated about two more issues that *T*-6 could be priced *-5 today.
The revival of the real estate mortgage investment conduit market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading.
Dealers noted that it *EXP*-1's difficult *PRO* to structure new Remics when prices are moving widely *T*-2.
The two Remics priced * were a $500 million *U* Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. issue underwritten * by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $350 million *U* Federal National Mortgage Association deal underwritten * by Greenwich Capital Markets.
The Remic issuance supported prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities, which *T*-1 held up better than Government National Mortgage Association securities during an afternoon sell - off.
Ginnie Mae 9% securities for November delivery ended at 97 29/32, down 7/32; 9 1/2% securities at 99 31/32, down 6/32; and 10% securities at 101 29/32, down 5/32.
Freddie Mac 9% securities were at 97 5/32, down 3/32.
The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.43% to a 12 - year average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury 10 - year note held at 1.42 percentage points.
Municipals
Confusion over the near - term trend for rates dominated the municipal arena, as gyrations in the stock market continued *-1 to buffet bonds.
Long tax - exempt dollar bonds were mostly flat to 3/8 point lower after a whipsaw session of *PRO* moving inversely to stocks in modest dealer - led trading.
Prices of pre-refunded municipal bonds were capped *-1 by news that Chemical Securities Inc., as agent for a customer, will accept bids today for two large lists of bonds that *T*-2 include many such issues.
The lists total $654.5 million *U*.
Pre-refunded bonds are called *-1 at their earliest call date with the escrowed proceeds of another bond issue.
Meanwhile, several new issues were priced *-1.
Underwriters led * by PaineWebber Inc. set preliminary pricing for $144.4 million *U* of California Health Facilities Financing Authority revenue bonds for Kaiser Permanente.
Tentative reoffering yields were set *-1 from 6.25% in 1993 to 7.227% in 2018.
As part of its College Savings Plan, Connecticut offered $100.4 million *U* of general obligation capital appreciation bonds priced *PRO* to yield to maturity from 6.25% in 1994 to 6.90% in 2006, 2007 and 2009.
A Chemical Securities group won a $100 million *U* Oregon general obligation veterans' tax note issue due Nov. 1, 1990.
The 6 3/4% notes yield 6.25%.
Foreign Bonds
West German government bond prices took a wild roller - coaster ride, *PRO* pulled down by Monday's U.S. stock market gains then up by a wider - than - *PRO* expected *-3 U.S. trade deficit and falling U.S. stock prices.
West Germany's 7% bond due October 1999 was at 99.95 late yesterday, off 0.10 point from Monday, *PRO* to yield 7.01%.
The 6 3/4% notes due April 1994 were up 0.10 point to 97.85 *PRO* to yield 7.31%.
British government bonds surged on renewed volatility in the stock market.
The Treasury 11 3/4% bond due 2003 / 2007 rose 23/32 to 112 10/32 *PRO* to yield 10.03%.
But Japanese bonds ended weaker.
The benchmark No. 111 4.6% bond due 1998 ended on brokers' screens at a price of 96, off 0.15 point *PRO* to yield 5.27%.
The federal government should make free, voluntary testing for the AIDS virus the cornerstone of an expanded campaign *PRO* to stop the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the Hudson Institute recommended 0 *T*-1.
"By *PRO* encouraging massive, routine, voluntary testing we can enable society *PRO*-4 to voluntarily segregate itself sexually into two groups: those who *T*-1 carry the virus and those who *T*-2 do not *?*," the Indianapolis research organization said *T*-3 in a new report.
The report takes a more alarmed view of AIDS and recommends a more sweeping response than many other analyses.
It warns that the AIDS epidemic "may reduce the rate of growth of the work force, curb productivity gains and slow economic growth."
It contends that current government policy is failing *-1 to stem the AIDS epidemic because it suggests 0 the use of condoms can make sex "safe."
But the report says: 0 "The only safe sex is sex between uninfected partners," and testing is the only way 0 *PRO* to learn of infection *T*-1.
Hudson's researchers estimated that it *EXP*-1 would cost less than $650 million *U* a year *PRO* to test the entire population between the ages of 12 and 65 years old.
In addition, the report recommends that federal and state governments provide free treatment to all who *T*-1 test *PRO*-2 positive.

Deeply ingrained in both the book review "*PRO* Kissing Nature Good - bye" by Stephen MacDonald (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27) and the books reviewed * is *T*-1 the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity.
Is such a view justified *-1?
In the absence of humans, would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term?
Clearly not.
About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended.
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America, northern Europe and Asia.
This global warming must have been entirely natural--nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter - gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves.
Furthermore, no bell has yet rung *PRO*-1 to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming.
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of *RNR*-1, or all of *RNR*-1, present - day global warming.
I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage, but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist - exploiters - greedy - American - consumers - global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion.

Robin Honiss, president and chief executive officer of this bank holding company, was elected *-3 to the additional posts of chairman, president and chief executive of the company's New England Savings Bank subsidiary.
William R. Attridge resigned those posts, as well as a seat on NESB's board.
NESB is also the parent of Omnibank.
Bankers Trust New York Corp. became the latest major U.S. bank 0 *T*-1 to increase reserves for its loans to less - developed countries, *PRO* making a $1.6 billion *U* third - quarter addition to its provision.
The bank also said 0 it expects *PRO*-1 to report a $1.42 billion *U* loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year.
The new reserves bring the company's provision for loans to Third World countries to $2.6 billion *U*, or 85% of Bankers Trust's medium and long - term loans to these countries.
"*PRO* Step up to the plate and take the big swing.
*PRO* Get the problem behind you and *PRO* don't look back," said *T*-1 James J. McDermott, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in *PRO* approving of the move.
Bankers Trust "has had the capacity *PRO* to do this for some time," the analyst said 0 *T*-1.
He expects Citicorp to take a similar step this year.
Citicorp yesterday reported a 9% third - quarter earnings drop, which analysts called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 a bit disappointing, while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. posted a $789 million *U* loss for the quarter after *PRO* adding $950 million *U* to its reserve for loans to less - developed countries.
Three other major U.S. banks posted earnings increases.
Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco posted a 17% jump.
PNC Financial Corp., the parent of Pittsburgh National Bank, reported 0 net income climbed 9.8%, while net for Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, grew 3.8%.
Citicorp
Analysts were only slightly disappointed *-1 by Citicorp's numbers.
"There's nothing in here that *T*-1's horrible and nothing 0 *T*-3 to make you think 0 they're setting the world on fire," said *T*-2 Carole Berger, analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
Earnings from the bank's global consumer business grew 27%.
"The consumer business continues *-1 to drive the earnings stream," said Mr. McDermott of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were "relatively flat, sometimes choppy," the bank said 0 *?*, and profit for the area sank 27%.
The cross-border loan portfolio reflected "adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns," the bank said 0 *?* no interest payments from Argentina in the nine months and none from Brazil in the third quarter, while Venezuela brought itself "*PRO*-1 substantially current."
Overall, the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $70 million *U* from $80 million *U* a year earlier.
"People were waiting *PRO*-2 to see if we would take an additional provision" for medium - term and long - term loans to less - developed countries, a Citicorp spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
But he reiterated the bank's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $2.6 billion *U*, covering about 30% of the $8.9 billion *U* of such loans outstanding.
Ronald I. Mandle, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., called Citicorp's venture - capital gains of $93 million *U* before taxes "*PRO*-1 strong."
A "concerning" item 0 the analyst cited *T*-2 was the 10% jump in expenses, which the bank attributes *T*-1 to costs of *PRO* expanding both its consumer credit - card operations and its overseas branch business.
Citicorp's spokesman said, however, that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth.
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo continued *-1 to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks, *PRO* minimizing a drop in net interest margin with 13% third - quarter growth in high - yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages.
Its margin fell only seven basis points, or 7/100ths of a percentage point, from a year ago, compared with a 13 - point drop at Security Pacific Corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country.
As a result, Wells Fargo's net interest income rose $36.3 million *U*, or 7%, to $537 million *U* for the quarter.
Non-interest income fell slightly to $191.9 million *U* from $193.3 million *U*, while Wells Fargo continued *-2 to rigorously control non-interest expense, which *T*-1 was almost flat at $393.4 million *U*.
The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave Wells Fargo a 1.25% return on average assets for the quarter, about 40% higher than Security Pacific's and a profit ratio matched * by only two or three other major banks in the U.S. .
Wells Fargo's return on equity increased to 24.4% from 23.8%.
Wells Fargo has sold all of its non-trade loans made * to less - developed countries, and managed *PRO*-2 to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans, which *T*-1 fell 8% from the previous quarter to $806.8 million *U* from $880.9 million *U*.
But the amount was still 39% higher than the year - ago level, and 25% higher as a percentage of total loans.
That trend, and Wells Fargo's heavy exposure to leveraged buy - outs, are about the only worries 0 analysts have *T*-1 about Wells Fargo's financial picture.
Wells Fargo is rebuilding its loan - loss reserve, which *T*-1 increased to $711 million *U* at Sept. 30 from $664 million *U* the previous quarter but was down from $852 million *U* a year ago, when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans *T*-2.
Manufacturers Hanover
Manufacturers Hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves, certain tax benefits, and a one - time $16 million *U* gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company, third - quarter earnings were $75 million *U*.
The comparable year - earlier number was $56 million *U*, a spokesman said *T*-1.
The bank's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less - developed countries to $2.4 billion *U*, *PRO* covering 36% of its medium and long - term loans outstanding to these nations.
The net interest margin - the difference between the bank's cost of funds and what it receives *T*-1 as interest payments--improved in the quarter, as did certain areas of wholesale banking.
Fees from syndicating loans dropped 48%, to $21 million *U*.
"We didn't take part in a lot of deals" in the quarter "because their credit quality was poor," the spokesman said *T*-1.
Expenses unrelated to interest rose 5.4%, to $541 million *U*.
PNC Financial
PNC Financial cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said 0 it continues *-1 to cut costs.
Net interest income in the third quarter edged up 1.4%, to $317.7 million *U*.
Trust income grew 15%, to $49.9 million *U*, while service charges, fees and commissions increased 22%, to $79.4 million *U*.
The bank's total allowance for credit losses was $502.1 million *U*, or 1.82% of total loans.
Lung - cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun *-1 to decline, federal researchers report 0 *T*-2.
The drop is particularly large for white males, although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates.
A report in this week's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin *-1 to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues *-2 to abate.
The report, which *T*-1 comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking, is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer.
"What this is saying *T*-1 is that the surgeon general's message is having an impact," said *T*-2 Melvyn Tockman, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.
The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart.
The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged * 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000, but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6, a decline of 28.7%.
*PRO*-1 Measured the same way, the decline for black males was 14.2%.
The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep--8.9% for blacks and 5.3% for whites.
The study, by Susan Devesa, William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute's staff, also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35 - 44 age bracket, except black men.
Although lung - cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole, the report projects that death rates will begin *-1 to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women.
Lung - cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing *-1 to rise for all age groups over 55, with sharp increases for everybody but white men.
But Dr. Fraumeni, one of the authors of the report, said "the declining rates 0 we're seeing *T*-3 for younger people we believe *T*-1 may *PRO* be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future."
However, he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking.
"Even though these favorable trends in lung - cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups, they can't be taken *-1 for granted," the report says *T*-2.
"Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population, especially children, adolescents and minorities."
An editorial in the NCI Journal says 0 the report of declining lung - cancer mortality "among young men and women in the U.S. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle--this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $2 billion *U* a year for promotion of the addictive habit of smoking *T*-1."
But the editorial, by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization, notes that tobacco consumption and lung - cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries.
"Non-smoking should be established *-1 as the norm of social behavior" around the world, the editorial says 0 *?*, through the enactment of laws that *T*-2 limit advertising, boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education.
*PRO*-2 Asked *-1 for comment, Walker Merryman, a vice president of the Tobacco Institute, said 0 new efforts *PRO* to restrict tobacco advertising in the U.S. could violate the First Amendment protection of free speech.
According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is responsible for 85% of the lung - cancer cases among men and 75% among women.
The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns.
A higher proportion of black men *ICH*-3 smoke than white men.
While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke, in both sexes more whites *ICH*-4 have given up smoking than blacks.
In *PRO* comparing changes in mortality rates over the past decade, the NCI study looked only at blacks and whites.
Asians and native Americans weren't studied *-2; Hispanics were included *-1 with whites.

The Internal Revenue Service plans *PRO*-1 to restructure itself more like a private corporation.
In addition, the tax - collecting agency says that it will take the unusual step of *PRO* looking to the private sector *PRO*-2 to fill two new high - level positions 0 *PRO* to guide the 120,000 - employee agency *T*-3: a comptroller 0 *T*-4 to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer 0 *T*-5 to update the information system, which *T*-1 includes probably the largest computer data base in the world.
The IRS also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer, who *T*-2 will be hired *-1 from within the agency.
IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg said 0 the changes are intended *-2 to bring "accountability" to the agency, which *T*-1 has an annual budget of more than $5 billion *U* and collects about $1 trillion *U* a year.
"My assessment and everyone's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that *T*-1 let us responsibly and effectively formulate and execute our budget," Mr. Goldberg said *T*-2.
"And we don't have internal controls and discipline that we need *-2 to have *T*-1 *PRO* to spend $5 billion *U* properly."
Mr. Goldberg, who *T*-2 took over as head of the IRS in July, has been disturbed *-1 by what he considers *T*-3 the inefficiency, waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency.
The IRS operates on a computer system designed * in 1961, which it has been trying *PRO* to modernize *T*-1 for years.
And the agency, which *T*-1 operated throughout fiscal 1989 with a $360 million *U* budget shortfall, has been under a hiring freeze since last fall.
The new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources *T*-1 will go a long way toward *PRO* enhancing its ability *PRO* to collect more tax revenue.
"I think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget formulation and execution process which, in turn, I believe 0 *T*-1 will result in a significant increase in revenue," he said *T*-2.
The IRS hopes *PRO*-1 to fill the new positions soon.
Customarily, it would appoint career civil servants from within the agency, but Mr. Goldberg said 0 he plans *PRO*-1 to "scour the world" for the chief information officer and the comptroller.
Although the jobs will probably pay between $70,000 and $80,000 *U* a year, IRS officials are confident that they can attract top - notch candidates from the private sector.
"You're telling someone 0 they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life *PRO*-1 bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever," Mr. Goldberg said *T*-2.
"On the comptroller side, you're developing *RNR*-1 and making work *RNR*-1 financial controls governing a $6 billion *U* budget.
Banks are continuing *-1 to go after individual investors, despite falling interest rates.
Yields on small - denomination certificates of deposit fell at about half the rate of so - called jumbo CDs this week, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based * here.
Investors can get slightly higher yields on deposits below $50,000 *U* than they can *?* on deposits of $90,000 *U* and up.
"Banks want *PRO*-2 to remain competitive," said *T*-1 Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote.
"October is a big rollover month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand...among people leaving the stock market."
Some bankers are reporting more inquiries *ICH*-1 than usual about CDs since Friday.
"Reports from branches are that there has been greater interest in the last day or so," said *T*-1 Steven Braitman, a vice president at Chemical Bank in New York.
Chemical said 0 deposits Monday were about $5 million *U* higher than usual and it expects more activity as investors receive the proceeds from sales of stock.

the Dow has more ups and downs than an elevator," proclaimed an advertisement Monday in New York newspapers, *PRO* touting Lincoln Savings Bank's one - year CD.
Harold Jones, Lincoln's chief retail banking officer, said 0 there hasn't yet been "a discernible response," although the ad included a coupon that *T*-1 could arrive later in the week.
Friday's market rout came smack in the middle of the heaviest month for CD rollovers, when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way *T*-1.
First National Bank of Boston, for example, is offering certain new depositors an extra quarter of a percentage point on six - month and 12 - month CDs.
Some banks actually boosted yields on the shortest term CDs in the latest week.
New York's Citibank, for instance, increased the yield on small - denomination three - month CDs to 8% from 7.9%.
On average, however, three - month CDs at major banks are yielding a tenth of a percentage point less than they were *?* a week ago.
Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold * at Monday's auction.
Six - month CDs of $50,000 *U* and less yielded an average 8.02% in the week ended Tuesday, down from 8.10%, according to Banxquote.
The yield on six - month T - bills fell to 7.82% on Monday, from 8.01% the week before.
Meanwhile, the average yield on six - month CDs of more than $90,000 *U* fell to 7.93% in the latest week, according to Banxquote, from 8.10% the week before.
Mr. Mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and large - denomination CDs, but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted *-1 by more frequent compounding.
CDs sold by major brokerage houses, which *PRO*-1 like jumbo CDs tend *-2 to closely follow interest rate trends, also posted larger drops in yields.
A six - month, broker - sold CD, for example, was yielding an average 8.09% *ICH*-1 in the latest week, a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before.
In late April, when interest rates were at their recent highs *T*-1, short - term CDs sold * by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks.
CD yields are generally expected *-1 to fall further in coming weeks.
"What *T*-3 happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit" reported * yesterday "make it *EXP*-2 unlikely that short - term interest rates will rise" any time soon, said *T*-1 Mr. Mehl of Banxquote.
"Even before the market drop, rates were down about half a percentage point," said *T*-1 Robert J. Hutchinson, senior vice president for retail marketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York.
"That puts pressure on CD rates.
William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said 0 Lincoln Savings & Loan Association should have been seized *-1 by the government in 1986 *PRO* to contain losses that he estimated 0 *T*-2 will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion *U*.
Mr. Seidman, who *T*-2 has been the nation's top bank regulator, inherited the problems of Lincoln, based * in Irvine, Calif., after his regulatory role was expanded *-1 by the new savings - and - loan bailout law.
He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings *PRO* to investigate what *T*-1 appears *-2 to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal - ridden industry.
The inquiry also will cover the actions of Charles Keating Jr., who *T*-1 is chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent, and who *T*-2 contributed heavily to several U.S. senators.
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created *PRO* to sell sick thrifts, has studied Lincoln's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986.
"My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate *PRO* cease - and - desist order *PRO* to stop the hazardous operations," Mr. Seidman said *T*-1.
When Lincoln was seized *-1 by the government *T*-3, for example, 15% of its loans, or $250 million *U*, were to borrowers who *T*-2 were buying real estate from one of American Continental's 50 other subsidiaries, according to Mr. Seidman.
But the government didn't step in until six months ago, when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship *T*-1--the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.
The bankruptcy filing, the government has charged 0 *?* in a $1.1 billion *U* civil lawsuit, was part of a pattern *PRO* to shift insured deposits to the parent company, which *T*-1 used the deposits as a cache for real - estate deals.
The deposits that *T*-2 have been transferred *-1 to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
"I think 0 it *EXP*-1's fairly clear 0 {Mr. Keating} knew," that regulators were set *PRO*-2 to seize Lincoln, Mr. Seidman said 0 *T*-3.
Further investigation, he said 0 *?*, may result in further actions against Lincoln's executives, said 0 *?* Mr. Seidman, "including fraud actions."
Mr. Keating, for his part, has filed suit *PRO*-1 alleging that regulators unlawfully seized the thrift.
Leonard Bickwit, an attorney in Washington for Mr. Keating, declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the hearings, except *PRO* to say 0, "We will be responding comprehensively in several forums to each of these allegations at the appropriate time."
Lincoln's treatment by former thrift regulators, in an agency disbanded * by the new law, has proved *-2 embarrassing for five senators who *T*-1 received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Mr. Keating.
Mr. Seidman said yesterday, for example, that Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), who *T*-2 received $48,100 *U* in contributions from Mr. Keating, phoned Mr. Seidman *PRO* to request that he push for a sale of Lincoln before it would be seized *-1.
After the government lawsuit was filed *-1 against Lincoln, Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions.
The senator's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because "hundreds of Arizona jobs {at Lincoln} were on the line."
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich .) has also returned contributions 0 he received *T*-1 from Mr. Keating a year ago.
Sens. John Glenn (D., Ohio), John McCain, (R., Ariz.) and Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) also received substantial contributions from Mr. Keating and sought *PRO*-1 to intervene on behalf of Lincoln.
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said 0 Sen. Cranston volunteered *PRO*-1 to appear before the House committee, if necessary.
But a committee staff member said 0 the panel is unlikely *PRO* to pursue closely the role of the senators.
At the hearing, Mr. Seidman said 0 the RTC has already pumped $729 million *U* into Lincoln for liquidity.
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $225 million *U* in American Continental subordinated debt.
Some of those debtholders have filed a suit, *PRO* saying 0 they believed 0 they were buying government - insured certificates of deposit.
"We have no plans *ICH*-1 at this time *PRO* to pay off those notes," he said *T*-2.
Matra S.A. reported 0 its 1989 first - half profit soared 88%, and indicated that its previous estimate of a 50% rise in earnings for all of 1989 will be exceeded *-1 by a wide margin.
The French electronics and defense group said 0 attributable consolidated net profit for the first six months of 1989 totaled 244 million francs ($38.4 million *U*), compared with 130 million francs ($20.5 million *U*) in the corresponding period of
Operating profit climbed 51%, to 572 million francs from 378 million in the first half of 1988.
Matra said 0 the sharp improvement in net profit partly reflected a decline of 59 million francs in the group's net loss from nonrecurring items in the first half of this year to 104 million francs from 163 million a year earlier.
There was also a decline in the group's net financial costs to 25 million francs from 50 million a year before.
These movements were offset *-1, however, by a steep rise in corporate income tax payments to 199 million francs from 35 million in the first six months of 1988.
Matra said 0 the sharp rise in its first - half earnings was based *-1 on a 15% gain in consolidated revenue to 10.16 billion francs from 8.85 billion a year earlier.
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it lowered ratings on about $650 million *U* of Beatrice Co. debt, *PRO* citing the closely held Chicago food concern's proposed recapitalization.
The ratings concern said 0 it downgraded Beatrice notes, Euronotes and certain industrial revenue bonds to single - B - 1 from Ba - 3 and the company's subordinated debentures to single - B - 3 from single - B - 2.
Moody's said 0 the proposed recaptilization may "limit the company's ability *PRO* to realize its profit potential" and that *PRO* paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze "basic business operations."
A Beatrice spokesman didn't return calls 0 *T*-1 seeking comment.
Beatrice, which *T*-1 went private in an $8.2 billion *U* leveraged buy - out in 1986, said last month that it might borrow again *PRO* to help pay investors as much as $983 million *U* in preferred stock and debt securities.
Stephen N. Wertheimer was named *-2 *PRO*-3 managing director *RNR*-1 and group head *RNR*-1 of investment banking in Asia, based * in Tokyo.
Mr. Wertheimer, 38 years old, had been a first vice president in the industrial group in investment banking.
He succeeds Everett Meyers, who *T*-1 resigned in May.
The Treasury plans *PRO*-1 to raise $1.55 billion *U* in new cash with the sale Monday of about $15.6 billion *U* in short - term bills 0 *PRO* to redeem $14.1 billion *U* in maturing bills *T*-3.
The offering will be divided *-1 evenly between 13 - week and 26 - week bills maturing on Jan. 25, 1990, and April 26, 1990, respectively.
Tenders for the bills, available in minimum $10,000 *U* denominations, must be received *-1 by 1 p.m. EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches.
HOPES OF *PRO* SIMPLIFYING the corporate minimum tax before 1990 are weakening.
The method of *PRO* calculating the 20% tax, paid * if it exceeds tax figured * the regular way, is due for a change in 1990, thanks to 1986's tax act.
But most experts agree that the concept that *T*-2 is *-3 to be introduced *-1 drags in great complexity; they have been trying *PRO*-4 to head it off this year.
Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski backed a simplification plan in the pending House tax bill, but the plan turns out *-1 to be a big revenue loser.
Now the Senate's stripped - down bill omits any proposal *PRO* to deal with the corporate tax.
Proponents of simplification fear that the chances of *PRO* getting it into the final bill are waning.
"We hear 0 it has low priority on the House side," says *T*-1 Samuel Starr of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs.
If the law isn't changed *-3, he says 0 *?*, "we are left *-4 *PRO*-6 staring at rules that *T*-1 are almost impossible 0 *PRO* to implement *T*-2, because there are so many complex depreciation calculations 0 *PRO* to do *T*-5."
But Congress still could resolve the issue with other legislation this year or next, Starr adds 0 *T*-1.
HUGO'S RAVAGES may be offset *-1 by immediate claims for tax refunds.
This law aids hurricane - wracked locales named * by the president as disaster areas, as well as regions so designated after other 1989 disasters.
It lets victims elect *PRO*-2 to deduct casualty losses on either 1989 or amended 1988 returns, whichever *T*-1 offers the larger tax benefit; they have until April 16 *PRO* to choose.
*PRO* Amending a 1988 return to claim a refund brings cash faster; but for personal losses, there are other factors 0 *PRO* to consider *T*-1, notes 0 *T*-2 publisher Prentice Hall.
A loss--after insurance recoveries--is deductible only to the extent that it exceeds $100 *U* *T*-4 and that the year's total losses exceed 10% of adjusted gross income *T*-5; victims may pick the year when income is lower and deductions higher *T*-3.
In *PRO* filing an original (not amended) return, a couple should consider whether damaged property is owned *-1 jointly or separately and whether one spouse has larger income; that may determine whether they should file jointly or separately.
THE IRS DELAYS several deadlines for Hugo's victims.
Returns for 1988 from people with six - month filing extensions were due Monday, but the IRS says 0 people in the disaster areas won't be penalized *-1 for late filing if their returns are marked *-2 "*PRO*-3 Hugo" and postmarked by Jan. 16.
Interest will be imposed *-1 on unpaid taxes, but late - payment penalties on the returns will be waived *-2 if the balance due and paid is 10% or less of the liability.
IRS Notice 89 - 136 describes this and other deadline relief for Hugo's victims.
Among the provisions: Fiscal - year taxpayers with returns due last Monday won't be penalized *-1 if they file--or request an extension--and pay tax due by Nov. 15.
Excise - tax returns due by Oct. 31 or Nov. 30 may be delayed *-1 to Jan. 16.
Extensions can't be granted *-1 for *PRO* filing employment - tax returns due Oct. 31 or for *PRO* depositing withheld taxes, but late penalties will be abated *-2 for deposits made * by Nov. 15.
The notice also grants relief for certain estate - tax returns.
ONE - DAY JAUNTS in a chartered boat were perks for permanent staffers of American Business Service Corp., a Costa Mesa, Calif., supplier of temporary workers.
The IRS denied cost deductions because few of the temps got *-1 to go aboard.
But the Tax Court said 0 the limitations were reasonable and realistic and allowed the deductions.

BIGGER THAN A BREADBOX was *T*-1 this cash hoarder's reputation for honesty.
People often cite frugality and distrust of banks *PRO* to justify cash caches to the IRS.
Gregory Damonne Brown of Fremont, Calif., a hardworking, reclusive young bachelor, told that story to the Tax Court.
But judges usually find 0 the real aim is *PRO* to escape tax on hidden income; and the IRS said 0 Brown must have had such income--although it uncovered no source--because he deposited $124,732 *U* in a bank account in 1982 - 84 while *PRO* reporting income of only $52,012 *U*.
Brown's story:
The deposits came from savings kept * in a Tupperware breadbox; he saved $47,000 *U* in 1974 - 81 by *PRO*-2 living with family members and pinching pennies and $45,000 *U* of secret gifts from his remorseful father, who *T*-82 had abandoned the family in 1955.
Brown had no proof; but testimony of his mother and stepmother about his father and of an ex-employer about his honesty and habits satisfied a judge that Brown was truthful and his tale of gifts was possible.
The IRS offered no evidence of hidden sources of taxable income, so Judge Shields rejected its claims.
BRIEFS:
*PRO*-1 Asked how he made charitable gifts of $26,350 *U* out of reported two - year income of $46,892 *U* *T*-2, Thomas H. McFall of Bryan, Texas, told the Tax Court 0 he had understated his income.
The court rejected his incredible claims, denied his deductions, and imposed a negligence penalty....
Rep. Schaefer (R., Colo.) entered a bill 0 *T*-1 to exempt from tax rewards for tips leading to the arrest of violent criminals.
US Facilities Corp. said 0 Robert J. Percival agreed *PRO*-1 to step down as vice chairman of the insurance holding company.
"There was a difference of opinion as to the future direction of the company," a spokeswoman said *T*-1.
Mr. Percival declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
In a statement, US Facilities said 0 Mr. Percival's employment contract calls for him to act as a consultant to the company for two years.
He will also remain a director, US Facilities said 0 *?*, but *PRO* won't serve on any board committees.
Mr. Percival will be succeeded *-1 on an interim basis by George Kadonada, US Facilities chairman and president.
In the same statement, US Facilities also said 0 it had bought back 112,000 of its common shares in a private transaction.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
The buy - back represents about 3% of the company's shares, based on the 3.7 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30.
In national over - the - counter trading yesterday, US Facilities closed at $3.625 *U*, unchanged.
L.J. Hooker Corp. is expected *-1 to reach an agreement *ICH*-2 in principle this week *PRO* to sell Merksamer Jewelers Inc. to management, say 0 *T*-3 executives familiar with the talks.
L.J. Hooker, based * in Atlanta, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year.
Currently, its parent company, Hooker Corp. of Sydney, Australia, is being managed *-1 by a court - appointed liquidator.
It is expected *-1 that GE Capital Corp., a financial - services subsidiary of General Electric Co., will provide much of the funding for the proposed leveraged buy - out of Merksamer, based * in Sacramento, Calif.
A spokesman for GE Capital declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
GE Capital has a working relationship with L.J. Hooker.
It is providing $50 million *U* in emergency financing to the company and has agreed *PRO*-1 to buy as much as $75 million *U* in receivables from B. Altman & Co. and Bonwit Teller, L.J. Hooker's two fully owned department - store chains.
Sam Merksamer, chief executive officer of the nationwide jewelry chain, and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker Corp., both declined *PRO*-1 to comment.
Currently, Mr. Merksamer owns 20% of the company; L.J. Hooker acquired its 80% interest in the firm in May 1986.
At the time, the Merksamer chain had 11 stores in operation.
Today, there are 77 units, all located * in shopping malls.
In recent weeks Mr. Merksamer has approached a number of his suppliers and asked them *PRO*-1 to provide letters of intent saying 0 they will continue *-2 shipping merchandise to the chain following the buy - out, say 0 *T*-3 those familiar with the situation.
This year, a number of retail leveraged buyouts have failed, *PRO* causing jitters among suppliers, and Mr. Merksamer apparently wanted assurances that he won't have delivery problems.
For the year ended June 30, 1989, Merksamer Jewelers had $62 million *U* of revenue and operating profit of $2.5 million *U*.
The jewelery chain was put *-1 up for sale in June.
According to those familiar with the situation, other bidders included Ratners Group PLC of London and Kay Jewelers Inc.
First Boston Corp. is advising L.J. Hooker on the sale of the Merksamer business.
Merksamer was the first in a series of retail acquisitions made * by L.J. Hooker.
The company was founded *-1 in Sacramento in 1929 by two brothers, Ralph and Walter Merksamer, who *T*-2 operated as DeVon's Jewelers.
In 1979, the pair split the company in half, with Walter and his son, Sam, agreeing *PRO*-1 to operate under the Merksamer Jewelery name.
The sale of Merksamer Jewelers is subject to approval by Judge Tina Brozman of U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
As *PRO* earlier reported *-1, L.J. Hooker this week received a $409 million *U* bid for its three shopping malls, plus other properties from a consortium led * by Honolulu real - estate investor Jay Shidler and A. Boyd Simpson, an Atlanta developer and former L.J. Hooker senior executive.
The offer, which *T*-2 didn't include the Merksamer chain, is being reviewed *-1 by Mr. Sigoloff.
We're sorry *PRO* to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
Mr. Allen, appointed * by President Reagan, grew understandably tired of *PRO* dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies.
His recent speech, provocatively titled "Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What *T*-1 is a Minority?" caused an uproar when its title leaked out *T*-2.
Mr. Allen's commissioners voted *PRO*-1 to call his unread speech "*PRO*-2 thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory."
Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said 0 it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who *T*-1 is chairman."
Rep. Don Edwards, the California Democrat, warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction."
Thomas Stoddard, head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the prospect of the speech "*PRO*-1 frankly shocking."
We've actually read the speech.
Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts, a California church group that *T*-1 opposes rights for homosexuals.
He said that other participants in the conference "do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed *-1 to citizens who *T*-2 are homosexual," but that "I mean *PRO*-3 to persuade you to the opposite view."
He recalled to the audience a "strange, infelicitous" analogy 0 he once heard *T*-1 *PRO* arguing "0 now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights, we need *-2 to do the same for animals.
" Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems *-1 to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals--as a mere project of charity, of humaneness."
Rights on such a basis, whether for blacks or homosexuals, are "mere indulgences," he said 0 *?*, subject to *PRO* being taken *-1 back.
He says 0 the title of his speech was *-1 to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals, not as members of certain select groups.
His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as *PRO* opposed to individual equality or, as he put it, in "a common destiny as Americans."
Instead of *PRO* lobbying for special treatment, Mr. Allen said that homosexuals and others should try *PRO*-2 to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that *T*-1 would risk "invidious retrenchment with government complicity."
This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed.
What *T*-1's really going on here?
The three most important things 0 *PRO* to understand *T*-1 about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual--a triple threat to the liberal establishment.
Mr. Allen, who *T*-1 teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years *PRO*-2 arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights.
He last made waves when he dared *PRO*-3 to defend an Indian girl who *T*-2 had been adopted *-1 by non-Indian parents off her reservation *T*-4.
Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment *ICH*-1 again, which *T*-3 somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual Indians.
There is a huge divide between Mr. Allen's we're - all - in - this - together view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups.
Indeed, the gap is so large that Mr. Allen's critics refuse *PRO*-1 to engage the debate.
Their ridicule of him is no substitute for argument.
Their effort *PRO* to run him out of Washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement.
We hope 0 the next head of the Civil Rights Commission will be as brave as Mr. Allen in *PRO* making the case for equality of civil rights.
Bearings Inc. said 0 its chairman, John R. Cunin, will retire as an officer of the company on Jan. 2.
George L. LaMore, president and chief executive officer, will become chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Cunin's retirement.
John C. Dannemiller, executive vice president and chief operating officer, will become president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Cunin, 65 years old, was chief executive of the distributor of bearings and power - transmission products from 1982 to 1988.
He will continue as a director.
Mr. LaMore, 63, a 48 - year veteran at Bearings, has been president since 1983.
Mr. Dannemiller, 51, joined Bearings in August 1988 from Leaseway Transportation Corp., where he was president and chief operating officer *T*-1.
He has been a Bearings director since 1985.
The appointments are part of a planned succession at the company.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev opened a major U.S. trade exhibition in Moscow and spent two hours *PRO* touring some of the 150 stalls representing such blue - chip companies as General Motors Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Johnson & Johnson.
At the Archer - Daniels - Midland Co. stand, Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller, a board member, offered him a soy burger.
He didn't bite.
The exhibition by the U.S. - U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council underscores the growing U.S. interest in that nation's market, though trade between the two countries is a minuscule $3 billion *U*.
The Soviet president and his prime minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, spent the longest time, about 15 minutes, at the IBM stand, where they got souvenir computer - chip key rings *T*-1.
At the GM stall, they barely looked at a gleaming Cadillac, *PRO* preferring *PRO*-1 to talk about cooperation possibilities.
In Beijing, meantime, China opened an international aviation show, but the West's embargo on military deals and uncertainty about the nation's stability kept many foreign exhibitors away.
Officials said 0 91 companies from 14 countries, including the U.S., had displays, down from about 260 firms from more than 20 countries at the last show in
Japanese air - conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd. was fined *-1 two million yen ($14,000 *U*) for *PRO* exporting to the Soviet Union a chemical solution that *T*-3 could be used *-2 in missile - guidance systems.
A Daikin executive in charge of exports when the high - purity halogenated hydrocarbon was sold *-1 to the Soviets in 1986 *T*-2 received a suspended 10 - month jail sentence.
Judge Masaaki Yoneyama told the Osaka District Court 0 Daikin's "responsibility is heavy because illegal exports lowered international trust in Japan."
Sale of the solution in concentrated form to Communist countries is prohibited *-1 by Japanese law and by international agreement.
A Soviet legislative panel rejected as not radical enough a government proposal on *PRO* decentralizing economic control.
The newspaper Leninskoye Zamya said 0 the committee decided 0 the plan *PRO* to parcel out economic powers previously exercised * by Moscow to the country's 15 republics "doesn't reflect the radical changes in the Soviet federation."
The committee gave the government until Nov. 15 *PRO* to revise the proposal.
The move reflected the growing confidence of the revamped Supreme Soviet.
Scott Paper Co. said 0 it is abandoning a proposed $650 million *U* tree - farming project in Indonesia because it no longer expects *PRO*-1 to use as much eucalyptus pulp as *PRO* previously anticipated.
The eucalyptus plantation and pulp mill, which *T*-2 would have covered about 175,000 acres in the Irian Jaya region, had been approved *-1 by Indonesia's investment board.
But it was opposed *-1 by some environmentalists as a threat to Irian Jaya's forests and a potential source of social unrest for the primitive tribes who *T*-2 inhabit them.
Yaohan Departmentstore Co. of Japan is moving its international - operations headquarters and holding company to Hong Kong *PRO* to gain from the British colony's economic advantages and tax structure.
With funds of 5.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$712 million *U*), the new company, Yaohan International Co., plans *PRO*-1 to acquire 10 of Hong Kong's top restaurants.
It also intends *PRO*-1 to set up an international wholesale market with the Singapore government next May and *PRO*-1 to open a department store in Bangkok and shopping centers in Malaysia, Taiwan, Canada, Chicago and Seattle by December 1990.
The chain currently has 90 retail outlets in Japan, seven in the U.S., three in Hong Kong and a dozen more scattered around the globe.
Major European auction houses are turning increasingly to specialized sales.
Christie's will soon have a sale of Dada and Symbolist art while Sotheby's is luring collectors with sales of Swiss, German, Spanish, Australian and Canadian paintings.
In Brussels, Hotel de Ventes Horta auctioned pistols and sabers - along with paintings and jewels.
Berlin's Villa Grisebach will auction art works with pre-sale estimates of less than $1,600 *U* on Nov. 25.
The auction house, known * for its sales of top - drawer 19th and 20th century works, is providing "a service to clients who *T*-1 don't want *PRO*-2 to sell just their fabulous oil paintings," says *T*-3 Villa Grisebach's Vivien Reuter.
Antwerp auctioneer Campo is less concerned with market niches than with Belgium's crushing tax and auction - fee burden.
"Everything has *PRO* to be the same between countries," says *T*-2 Campo's Stefan Campo, who *T*-1 is asking clients *PRO*-3 to sign protest petitions.
"Then there'll be fair competition."
*PRO* Ending tax - free shopping in the European Community after 1992 could threaten more than 3,000 jobs, the International Duty Free Confederation said *T*-1.
Instead of *PRO* banning such shopping, the confederation proposed *PRO* amending controls *PRO* to be sure 0 the privilege isn't abused *-1....
British and Argentine diplomats opened talks *ICH*-1 in Madrid aimed * at *PRO* restoring ties severed * because of their 1982 war over the Falkland Islands.
Britain's U.N. representative and delegation head Crispin Tickell called the first meeting "*PRO*-1 good, interesting and businesslike.
President Bush will veto a bill funding the Departments of Labor, Education and Health and Human Services because it would allow federal funding of abortions for victims of rape and incest, the White House said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Bush had threatened a veto previously.
But he put off a firm decision while his aides and legislators searched for a compromise that *T*-1 would tighten requirements for such abortions in a way acceptable to the president.
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said 0 negotiations between Bush aides and lawmakers ended Monday without success.
Most lawmakers think 0 it *EXP*-1 will be extremely difficult for Mr. Bush's opponents on the abortion issue to round up the votes needed * *PRO* to override the veto.
But there still may be prolonged debate and political maneuvering that *T*-1 holds up the $156.7 billion *U* funding bill for the fiscal year that *T*-2 began Oct. 1.
Mr. Bush has said 0 he personally approves of abortions in the cases of rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother.
But he has opposed Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women who *T*-2 say 0 they are victims of rape and incest, *PRO* arguing that those exceptions are enforced *-1 so loosely that they open the way for abortions for other women.
Michael A. Gaskin, 55 years old, was named *-2 *PRO*-3 president *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of this manufacturer of industrial robots, *PRO*-2 succeeding Walter K. Weisel.
Mr. Weisel, 49, resigned as president and chief executive and will work on special projects, said 0 *T*-1 John J. Wallace, chairman.
Mr. Gaskin formerly was president *RNR*-2 and chief executive *RNR*-2 of Taylor & Gaskin Inc. and was a director of Prab Robots since 1985.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said 0 a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related * to its Galileo space probe, which *T*-2 is *-3 to be launched *-1 today.
Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman, said 0 the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called *PRO* *PRO*-2 Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected *-1 by today.
Although the network isn't connected *-2 to the computer systems that *T*-1 operate either Galileo or the shuttle, part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn.
Mr. Redmond said 0 the intruder hadn't yet done any harm but the agency feared 0 "garbage data could be substituted *-1 for real data."
He estimated 0 it *EXP*-1 could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system.
The intruder, among the broadest yet 0 *T*-2 to hit a research network, appeared *-3 to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that *T*-1 uses Digital's VAX / VMS operating system.
It is unrelated to the much - publicized virus that *T*-1 last year infected Arpanet, a much larger network used * by researchers at universities, laboratories and government agencies around the world.
In the lingo of computer security, the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm, Mr. Redmond said 0 *T*-1.
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by *PRO* boring into other computers contacted * through networks.
The Galileo worm apparently was hatched *-1 on a computer in France hooked up to NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network, Mr. Redmond said 0 *T*-2.
NASA said 0 the Galileo worm hadn't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems *PRO*-1 to reject worms.
But Mr. Redmond said 0 the worm hit universities that *T*-1 hadn't elected *PRO*-2 to make the changes.
Michael Alexander, a senior editor at Computerworld, a trade publication, said 0 he was told *-1 that the worm gets into a computer center by *PRO* looking for obvious passwords--such as ones that *T*-2 are the same as the user's name.
If it finds one and gets into the system, it will display a screen *ICH*-1 when a user logs on *T*-3 that *T*-2 says, "Worms Against Nuclear Killers....
You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war."
In addition, Mr. Alexander said 0 *?*, the worm sends strange messages *ICH*-2 to other machines at the center--such as, "George Orwell was an optimist," or "*PRO* Don't feed the bats tonight."
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that *T*-1 confer more privileges on the user.
The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed *-1 *T*-3 but are supposed *-4 to be replaced *-2 as soon as the system is up and running.
If it finds one of those passwords, Mr. Alexander said 0 *?*, the worm will do such things as *PRO*-2 change users' passwords to a series of random numbers, *PRO* preventing them from *PRO* signing on to the network.
NASA estimated that, on Monday, about four computer centers were affected *-1.
Yesterday, the number grew to 40; today the number is expected *-1 to grow to 100.
NASA said 0 it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected * to Internet *T*-2 were affected *-1 and the extent of the damage, if any.
Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium *PRO*-1 to generate the electricity needed * *PRO* to run the craft.
Activists fear that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode, or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times 0 it flies close to the planet, fatal levels of plutonium would be released *-1 into the atmosphere.
So far Galileo has been delayed *-1 twice, once because of a computer malfunction connected * with a space - shuttle engine, and yesterday because of the weather.
NASA said 0 the Galileo worm had nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with either delay.
Mr. Alexander of Computerworld said 0 hackers have gone after SPAN before.
He said 0 the Chaos Computer Club, of West Germany, once managed *PRO*-1 to invade SPAN and do such things as 0 *PRO* change the value of pi, *PRO* messing up some calculations.
Paul Ely, general partner of Alpha Partners, a venture - capital firm based * in Menlo Park, Calif., was named *-1 *PRO*-2 a director of this computer company.
Mr. Ely, 57 years old, temporarily increases the board to seven members.
However, director Thomas O'Rourke has said 0 he won't seek re-election at the company's annual meeting next month.
The nations of southern Africa know a lot about *PRO* managing elephants; their herds are thriving.
But the nations of Europe and North America have decided 0 they know better.
At this week's U.N. conference in Lausanne, they imposed a global ivory ban that *T*-1 seeks *PRO*-2 to overturn local policies.
A Zimbabwean delegate argued that the ban would "guarantee the extinction of the elephant."
Legitimate ranchers, who *T*-1 have an interest in *PRO* preserving the herds, would go out of business.
Poachers would control the underground trade.
Many delegates were willing *PRO* to craft a compromise, but U.S. delegate Constance Harriman and others thundered that down.
The Greens from the First World wanted a morality play, not a negotiation.
Fortunately, the nations of southern Africa haven't totally surrendered their sovereignty.
Five countries announced 0 they would not honor what one Zimbabwean delegate wryly called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 the "made in Switzerland" solution.
In fact, they seemed *-1 a mite resentful.
The director of Zimbabwe's Wildlife Department described American conservationists as "fat little puppies from urban environments who *T*-1 don't know a thing about Africa."
That's not fair; they're not all fat.
Amstrad PLC, a British maker of computer hardware and communications equipment, posted a 52% plunge in pretax profit for the latest year.
The #76.6 million *U* ($120.6 million *U*) in pretax profit for the 12 months to June 30 was down from #160 million *U* ($252 million *U*) a year earlier and below market expectations of #80 million and #90 million *U*.
The slump in profit, which *T*-2 came despite steady sales, was attributed *-1 to increased costs for parts and problems with model introductions.
Amstrad's profit after taxes fell a similarly steep 51%, to #51.1 million *U* from #105 million *U* a year earlier.
Sales edged up fractionally to #626.3 million *U* from #625.4 million *U* a year earlier.
When the Soviets announced 0 their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February *T*-1, the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria.
It was "the Soviets' Vietnam."
The Kabul regime would fall.
Millions of refugees would rush home.
A resistance government would walk into Kabul.
Those who *T*-1 bought that illusion are now bewildered.
Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R., a Soviet - controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever.
But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily.
Soviet leaders said 0 they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary--and did *?*.
The U.S. said 0 it would fully support the resistance--and didn't.
With the February 1987 U.N. accords "relating to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything 0 it needed *T*-1 *PRO* to consolidate permanent control.
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow *PRO*-1 free *PRO* to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind--including the return of Soviet ground forces--while *PRO* requiring the U.S. and Pakistan *PRO*-2 to cut off aid.
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last - minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did *?*.
But as soon as the accords were signed *-1, American officials sharply reduced aid.
In February 1989, when the Soviets said 0 they had completed their pullout *T*-1, the U.S. cut it further.
Not so the Soviets.
Gen. Gromov himself said 0 Soviet troops expected *-1 to leave behind more than $1 billion *U* of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime.
Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million *U* worth per month--nearly $2 billion *U* since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years.
This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 "new peaceful long - range weapons," including more than 800 SCUD missiles.
By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles.
Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T - 72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state - of - the - art infantry fighting vehicles.
By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet - trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar.
In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG - 7B missiles, the bomber version of the An - 12, MiG - 23BN high - altitude aircraft, MiG - 29s, which *T*-28 can outfly Pakistan's U.S. - built F16s, and Sukhoi SU - 27 fighter - bombers, which *T*-29 can outfly the MiG - 29s.
Moscow claims 0 this is all needed *PRO* to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance.
It *EXP*-1 is well - known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled *-2 with reluctant conscripts.
But this is not the entire Afghan army, and it is no longer Kabul's only military force.
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated *-1 in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned.
In addition, the regime has established well - paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000, including 35,000 Soviet - trained troops of the Interior Ministry (KHAD / WAD), which *T*-2 still is directed *-1 by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers.
Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime, they are now dependent on it.
And thousands of Afghan children have been taken *-1 to the Soviet Union, where they are hostage for the behavior of their families *T*-2.
Since 1981, Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime.
In preparation for the withdrawal, Moscow, Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements 0 for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel *T*-1.
Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979.
The Soviets cut a deal with Iran: a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy.
The deal was symbolized *-1 by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry.
Moreover, serious questions have been raised *-1 about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces.
Before his assassination in 1988, President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted *-1 into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn *-2.
Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards, ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms.
Meanwhile, the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at *PRO* portraying the resistance as bloody - minded fanatics.
In this they are aided *-1 by years of American, European, Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions--radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies *T*-2 are anathema to the Afghan public.
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better, moderate leaders.
In autumn last year, for example, the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared *PRO*-1 to surrender the city to resistance moderates.
At the last minute, however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be made *-1 to his forces.
The deal fell through, and Kandahar remains a major regime base.
The resistance lacks not only air power, armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps, mine detectors, or even winter gloves.
Experienced resistance commanders wanted *PRO*-1 to use guerrilla action and siege tactics *PRO*-2 to wear down the regime.
Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan's ISI, the channel for their support, into *PRO* attacking Jalalabad.
They took more than 25% casualties; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors.
The wonder is not that the resistance has failed *-1 to topple the Kabul regime, but that it continues *-2 to exist and fight at all.
Last summer, in response to congressional criticism, the State Department and the CIA said 0 they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut *-3 off; but it *EXP*-2 is not clear how much *T*-5 is being sent *-4 or when it will arrive *T*-1.
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack.
Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied *-1 with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons.
Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves *T*-1 by the end of this year.
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful.
For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent, based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf.
No settlement negotiated * by others can force the Afghan people *PRO*-1 to give up their struggle.
A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them *PRO*-1 to die in vain.
Creation of a new, realistic U.S. policy is long overdue.

Unilab Corp., Norcross, Ga., said 0 it acquired the clinical laboratories of closely held Central Diagnostic Laboratory Inc. in a cash and securities transaction valued * at $85 million *U*.
Unilab said 0 its wholly owned MetWest Inc. unit paid $25 million *U* in cash, provided $30 million *U* in notes and $30 million *U* in preferred stock *PRO* to acquire Central's labs in the Western U.S. .
Unilab, which *T*-1 provides clinical laboratory services, competed with Central, based * in Tarzana, Calif., in a number of areas.
Beyond *PRO*-2 removing a competitor, the combination should provide "synergies," said 0 *T*-1 Fred Harlow, Unilab's chief financial officer.
It also will hand Unilab new markets.
In Los Angeles, for example, Central has had a strong market position while Unilab's presence has been less prominent, according to Mr. Harlow.
A.F. Sloan, 60 years old, announced that he will retire next April as chairman *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of this snack food and bakery products maker.
No replacement was immediately named *-1.
Mr. Sloan plans *PRO*-1 to remain on the board until his current term expires in April 1991, a Lance spokesman said 0 *T*-2.
National Semiconductor Corp. said 0 it settled a four - year - old patent infringement case against Linear Technology Corp. by *PRO*-1 accepting a $3 million *U* payment from Linear in exchange for *PRO* granting Linear irrevocable licenses for all products involved *.
The two companies also agreed *PRO*-1 to settle any future property rights issues over the next 10 years through binding arbitration, both companies said 0 *T*-2.
The products are so - called analog integrated circuits that *T*-1 have applications in the consumer electronics, automobile and electronic instrumentation markets.
Linear Technology, Milpitas, Calif., called the settlement "*PRO*-1 positive," since products covered * by the disputed patents account for about 20% of its annual sales.
The electronics concern said 0 it already has paid $2 million *U* of the settlement to National Semiconductor, Santa Clara, Calif., and will pay the remaining $1 million *U* in equal installments over the next eight quarters.
The payments aren't expected *-1 to have an impact on coming operating results, Linear added 0 *T*-2.
NBC's winning streak has been canceled *-1.
The National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., had its record - breaking 68 - week reign as the prime - time ratings leader snapped *-1 yesterday by ABC - TV, a subsidiary of Capital Cities / ABC Inc.
In the ratings compiled * by the A.C. Nielsen Co., ABC, which *T*-1 broadcast the World Series, topped the competition with a 14.8 rating and 25 share.
NBC was second with a 13.9 rating and 24 share followed by CBS Inc.'s television network with a 12.5 rating and 21 share.
(A ratings point represents 904,000 television households; shares indicate the percentage of sets in use.)
The first two games of the World Series between the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants didn't finish in the top 10; instead they landed in 16th and 18th place.
The highest - rated show continues *-1 to be ABC's "Roseanne."
NBC had five of the top 10 shows; ABC had four and CBS had one.
CBS held the previous record for consecutive No. 1 victories--46 weeks--during the 1962 - 63 season.
Directors elected R. Marvin Womack, currently vice president / product supply, purchasing, *PRO*-1 to head the company's Washington, D.C., office.
As vice president / national - government relations, Mr. Womack will work with P&G's top management and with the company's government - relations staff "*PRO*-2 to represent P&G's interests at the federal level," said 0 *T*-1 John G. Smale, chairman and chief executive officer.
Mr. Smale said 0 the appointment "recognizes the growing influence of government on our business."
Mr. Womack, 53 years old, has been with the big producer of household products, food and pharmaceuticals for 30 years.
Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, *PRO* expanding its presence in the food service market, said 0 it acquired Maryland Club Foods, a coffee supplier, from an investor group led * by F. Philip Handy of Winter Park, Fla.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Houston - based Maryland Club Foods, which *T*-1 had sales of about $200 million *U* last year, sells coffee under the Maryland Club and Butter - Nut brands to restaurants, hotels, offices and airlines.
The acquisition "gives us additional production capacity for the food service coffee business and a stronger distribution network," a P&G spokesman said 0 *T*-1.
P&G already sells its Folgers ground roast coffee to food service concerns, but not to as many markets as Maryland Club.
For example, P&G up until now hasn't sold coffee to airlines and does only limited business with hotels and large restaurant chains.
Maryland Club also distributes tea, which *T*-1 fits well with P&G's Tender Leaf brand, and hot cocoa products.
The company said 0 the acquisition has been completed and reviewed *-1 by the Federal Trade Commission.
The purchase includes a coffee - roasting plant in Omaha, Neb., and a leased facility in Houston.
Eastern Airlines' creditors committee, unhappy with the carrier's plans for *PRO* emerging from bankruptcy - law proceedings, asked its own experts *PRO*-1 to devise alternate approaches to a reorganization.
Representatives of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and the securities firm of Goldman, Sachs & Co., hired * by creditors *PRO* to consult on Eastern's financial plans, told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that Eastern's latest plan *PRO* to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which *T*-1 won the creditors' approval.
According to one person present at the meeting, Eastern's new plan is financially "overly optimistic."
*PRO*-1 Asked about the consultants' reports, an Eastern spokeswoman said 0 "we totally disagree."
She said 0 they have "oversimplified and made some erroneous assumptions that *T*-1 make their analysis completely off - base."
At a later news conference here, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said 0 Eastern was exceeding its goals for *PRO* getting back into operation and predicted 0 it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year, *PRO* operating with more service than it originally had scheduled.
He insisted, as he has *?* before, that creditors would be paid *-1 in full under the plan.
Mr. Lorenzo made no mention of creditors' negative response to his plan.
"We're in the process of *PRO* discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate *PRO* filing that amended plan shortly," Mr. Lorenzo told reporters *T*-1.
"We're meeting and surpassing our goals," he added *T*-1.
In July, Eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that *T*-1 called for Eastern to sell $1.8 billion *U* in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy - law protection at two - thirds its former size.
But after *PRO* selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle, its Philadelphia hub and various planes, Eastern hit a stumbling block.
It couldn't sell its South American routes, one of the major assets marked * for disposal.
Those routes, valued * by the creditors' professionals at about $400 million *U*, were *-2 to be sold *-1 to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
A last - minute snag in negotiations with AMR, over an unrelated lawsuit between American and another Texas Air unit, caused the deal to collapse.
Eastern ultimately decided 0 it would have *-2 to keep and operate the routes itself, which *T*-1 would leave it with less cash for its reorganization.
It also would leave Eastern *PRO*-1 a bigger carrier than the scaled - down one proposed * under the initial plan.
Those changes in its condition meant 0 the reorganization plan previously presented * to creditors would have *-2 to be revamped *-1.
Since then, Eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions, but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions.
The committee has two groups of experts 0 it calls on *T*-1 *PRO* to analyze Eastern's plans.
Both said 0 the new plan wouldn't work.
Ernst & Young said 0 Eastern's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest, tax and depreciation by $100 million *U*, and that Eastern's plan presented no comfort level, according to a source present at yesterday's session.
Experts from Goldman Sachs estimated 0 Eastern would miss the same mark by $120 million to $135 million *U*, the source said *T*-1.
The experts said 0 they expected 0 Eastern would have *-1 to issue new debt *PRO* to cover its costs, and that it would generate far less cash than 0 *PRO* anticipated *T*-2.
Other costs *ICH*-1 also would increase, including maintenance, because Eastern has an older fleet.
At the news conference, Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment.
*PRO*-1 Flanked by flight attendants, pilots and gate agents dressed * in spiffy new blue uniforms, they said 0 Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats.
*PRO* Starting next month, Eastern will begin *-2 flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700, they said 0 *T*-1.
Mr. Bakes declined *PRO*-1 to give out Eastern's daily losses, but said 0 he didn't expect 0 Eastern would have *-2 to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held * in escrow.
These accounts hold several hundred million dollars, primarily from asset sales.
The plan 0 Eastern hopes *PRO*-2 to pursue *T*-1, he said 0 *?*, calls for Eastern to have $390 million *U* in cash by year's end.
Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted 0 that plan might be confirmed *-1 in January.
As to negotiations with creditors, Mr. Lorenzo said in remarks after the conference "0 we'll have *-1 to see how they {talks} come along *T*-2."
However, he added, "it *EXP*-2's not a requirement that the plan be accepted *-3 by creditors.
It must be accepted *-1 by the court."
Under bankruptcy law, Eastern has exclusive rights *ICH*-1 for a certain period *PRO* to develop its own reorganization plan.
That deadline has been extended *-1 once and could be extended *-1 again.
If Eastern can get creditor support, court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift.
But creditors are free *PRO* to press for court approval of their own plan, or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own.
In any event, some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as *PRO* forecast *-1 by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes.
Eastern sought bankruptcy - law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4.
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters 0 the reorganization 0 Eastern is pursuing *T*-1 would create a carrier 85% to 90% *U* of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern.
He projected 0 it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring, only slightly fewer than the carrier's old volume of 1,050 a day.
Luis Nogales, 45 years old, has been elected *-1 to the board of this brewer.
Mr. Nogales, former president of United Press International and the Univision Spanish - language network, most recently co-founded Nogales Castro Partners, a California - based media acquisition firm.
Mr. Nogales, the first Hispanic person 0 *T*-1 to serve as a Coors director, is an addition to the board, *PRO* increasing its membership to nine.
Stock - market tremors again shook bond prices, while the dollar turned in a mixed performance.
Early yesterday, investors scrambled *PRO*-2 to buy Treasury bonds for safety as stock prices plummeted and fears *ICH*-1 mounted of a replay of Friday.
But stocks later recovered, *PRO* erasing most of their early declines.
That cut *PRO*-1 short the rally in Treasury bonds and depressed prices moderately below late Monday's levels.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down more than 60.25 points early in the day, finished 18.65 points lower at 2638.73.
Long - term Treasury issues declined about half a point, or $5 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount.
"The stock market clearly is leading the bond markets," said *T*-1 Jack Conlon, an executive vice president at Nikko Securities.
"People are breathing a major sigh *ICH*-1 of relief that the world didn't end Monday morning" or yesterday.
Gold, a closely watched barometer of investor anxiety, was little changed.
The dollar initially fell against other major currencies on news that the U.S. trade deficit surged in August to $10.77 billion *U*.
But the dollar later rebounded, *PRO* finishing slightly higher against the yen although slightly lower against the mark.
Federal Reserve officials sent another signal of their determination *PRO* to shore up investor confidence.
In an apparent attempt *PRO* to keep a lid on short - term interest rates, the Fed once again pumped money into the banking system.
But the Fed move was a small gesture, traders said 0 *T*-1.
Fed officials appear *-3 reluctant *PRO*-4 to ease their credit grip any further because a bold move doesn't appear *-2 necessary, several investment managers said 0 *T*-1.
The Fed has allowed a key short - term interest rate to decline about one - quarter percentage point.
The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks has been hovering around 8 3/4%, down from 9% previously.
Although stocks have led bonds this week, some traders predict 0 that relationship will reverse during the next few weeks.
Nikko's Mr. Conlon fears 0 a huge wave of Treasury borrowing early next month will drive down Treasury bond prices.
That, coupled * with poor third - quarter corporate - earnings comparisons, "will make trouble for the equity market for the next two to three months," he says 0 *T*-1.
But several other traders contend 0 investors have overreacted to junk - bond jitters, and that stock prices will continue *-1 to recover.
"They shot the whole orchestra just because the piano player hit a bad note," said *T*-1 Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., *PRO* referring to the stock market's plunge Friday on news of trouble in *PRO* financing the UAL Corp . buy - out.
In major market activity: Treasury bond prices fell.
The yield on 30 - year Treasury bonds climbed back above 8%, *PRO* ending the day at 8.03%.
The dollar was mixed.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar rose to 142.75 yen from 141.80 yen Monday, but fell to 1.8667 marks from 1.8685 marks.
The Consumer News and Business Channel cable network and U.S. News & World Report have formed a joint venture *PRO* to produce cable program versions of special issues of the magazine.
The programs will run on the cable network the Sunday evening immediately prior to the release of the special issue of U.S. News & World Report.
CNBC is a joint venture of the National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., and Cablevision System Corp.
Advertisers will be offered *-1 an advertising package, which for a single price, *T*-2 will include time on the CNBC program and ad pages in the special guides.
CNBC will produce six, one - hour programs, *PRO* beginning in April 1990.
The first program scheduled * in the joint venture is "The 1990 Homeowner's Guide."
Other programs and special issues will be based *-1 on themes of health, jobs, personal finance, the best colleges, and investments.
The programs will be written and produced *-1 by CNBC, with background and research provided * by staff from U.S. News & World Report.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined and suspended two commodities traders accused *-2 of *PRO* making prearranged trades *ICH*-1 with each other that *T*-3 allegedly cheated a customer.
Merc officials said 0 Gary N. Roberts was disciplined *-1 following the exchange's investigation of his trading in several commodities pits from July to November 1988.
The Merc said 0 Mr. Roberts withheld from the market certain orders in cooperation with another trader, David Stein.
The Merc fined Mr. Roberts $15,000 *U* and suspended his trading membership for three years.
Also, he and Mr. Stein were ordered *-1 *PRO*-2 to make restitution of $35,000 *U* to a customer.
Mr. Stein was fined $25,000 *U* and suspended for three years.
Messrs. Roberts and Stein couldn't be reached *-1 for comment.
The Merc said that as part of the disciplinary settlement, neither man admitted, nor denied the alleged violations.
Neither was among the 46 traders indicted * last August in a federal investigation of traders at both the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
Kay Peterson mounts her bicycle and grinds up yet another steep, rocky path seemingly suitable only for mountain goats.
After a tortuous climb, she is rewarded *-1 by a picture - postcard vista: a glade of golden aspens under an azure Indian - summer sky.
This place is 12 miles into the back country--a day - long trudge for a hiker, but reached by Ms. Peterson and six others in a mere two hours of *PRO* pedaling fat - tired mountain bikes.
"This," says *?* Ms. Peterson, "is what it's all about *T*-1."
Twelve hundred miles away, rangers at a Napa County, Calif., state park are among the many who *T*-1 don't quite share the enthusiasm.
This summer, speeding bikers were blamed *-1 for an accident in the Napa County park, in which a horse--spooked * on a trail that *T*-3 was closed *-2 to bikers--broke its leg *T*-4.
The animal had *-2 to be destroyed *-1; the bikers fled and were never found *-3.
In numerous parks near San Francisco, rangers have been forced *-1 *PRO*-3 to close trails *RNR*-2, set up speed traps *RNR*-2 and use radar guns *RNR*-2 *PRO*-4 to curb fast and reckless riding.
They have even sent helicopters in pursuit of bikers after hikers and equestrians complained 0 they were being driven *-1 from trails.
"We were being overrun," says *T*-1 Steve Fiala, trails coordinator of the East Bay Regional Park District.
Two years ago, the district decided *PRO*-1 to limit the bikes to fire roads in its 65,000 hilly acres.
From about 200,000 six years ago, the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected *PRO* to grow to 10 million in 1990 *T*-1.
At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone.
The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all - terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms 0 *T*-1 to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory.
Bikers--many of them ardent environmentalists--proclaim their sport an efficient, safe, fitness - promoting way 0 *PRO* to get back to nature *T*-1, while *PRO* asserting a right *ICH*-2, as taxpayers, *PRO* to pedal on public lands.
But the bikes' burgeoning numbers, safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile landscapes have prompted pleas *ICH*-1, from the Sierras to the Eastern Seaboard, *PRO* to ban them from the back country.
Key to the issue is *T*-1 that the bikes, in skillful hands, can go virtually anywhere, and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror.
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without *PRO* losing balance.
Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour--a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians.
For harried public - land managers across the nation, the response is increasingly *PRO* to shut the gates.
The state of California, *PRO*-2 following the lead of some regional parks, recently adopted regulations that *T*-1 closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles.
The move largely consigns them to roads used * by motorized vehicles.
Most other states have enacted similar bans.
The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks.
Even the U.S. Forest Service, whose lenient "multiple - use" philosophy *T*-2 permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S., has begun *-4 to close some lands *ICH*-1 to the bikes, including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which *T*-3 stretches from California to Canada.
Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations, the politically potent Sierra Club among them.
Sierra has been instrumental in *PRO* securing a number of the California bans.
It has been waging an all - out campaign *PRO* to beat back a proposal *ICH*-1, pushed * by Utah bike groups, *PRO* to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas, where they are now prohibited *-3 *T*-2.
Yet Sierra's hard - line stance has created something of a rift in the organization, which *T*-1 estimates that 17% of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes.
Pressure from these members prompted the club recently *PRO*-1 to soften its anti-bike rhetoric; it no longer, for example, lumps the bikes into the same category as motorcycles and other terrain - marring off - road vehicles.
But the club still insists that public lands ought *PRO*-1 to be closed *-1 to the bikes unless studies indicate 0 the bikes won't injure the environment or other users.
"I have a mountain bike, yet as a hiker I've been run *-1 off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them," says *T*-2 Gene Coan, an official at Sierra's headquarters in San Francisco, *PRO* echoing the concerns of many members.
"People who *T*-2 feel that cyclists should be banned *-1 from an area aren't looking at the whole picture," complains *T*-3 Mark Langton, associate editor of Mountain and City Biking magazine in Canoga Park, Calif.
Mr. Langton is among the legions of bikers who *T*-1 got their first taste of wilderness as hikers or backpackers.
He says 0 fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated *T*-2 as hikers; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy.
*PRO*-1 To fight back, activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups 0 *T*-2 to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs 0 *T*-3 to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails.
Mr. Langton's group, Concerned Off - Road Bicyclists Association, mounted petition drives 0 *T*-1 to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated * for closing.
Biking groups in Montana, Idaho, Michigan and Massachusetts have won similar concessions, says 0 *T*-1 Tim Blumenthal, mountain bike editor of Bicycling magazine.
These groups have been trying *PRO*-2 to improve the mountain biker's image; in the San Francisco - area park district where a ranger was clobbered *-1 by a cyclist this summer *T*-3 bikers have formed a volunteer patrol 0 *T*-4 to help rangers enforce regulations, and to school riders in proper trail etiquette.
Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10% of all riders cause most of the problems.
While some are renegade riders who *T*-3 simply scorn regulations, much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that *T*-2 can be corrected *-1 through "education and peer pressure," says *T*-4 Jim Hasenauer, a director of the International Mountain Biking Association.
"I think 0 we're making progress."
Few would have foreseen such a furor when, a decade ago, some Marin County bicycle enthusiasts created a hybrid bike *PRO* using fat tires, lightweight metallurgy and multi-gear technology *T*-1.
They wanted a machine that *T*-1 would allow them to pedal into rugged terrain then inaccessible to cycles.
They got a machine more responsive, more stable and in many ways easier 0 *PRO* to ride *T*-2 than the thin - tired racing bikes that *T*-1 then were the rage.
When the bikes first entered mass production in 1981 *T*-2, they were dismissed *-1 as a fad.
Last year, 25% of the 10 million bicycles sold * in the U.S. were mountain bikes.
In California, a bellwether market, they accounted for more than 80% of all bike sales.
The majority of the bikes never even make it into the high country.
City dwellers love them because they shift smoothly in traffic, bounce easily over curbs and roll through road glass with far fewer flat tires than racing bikes.
Crested Butte, population 1,200, is a bastion of the sport.
By one estimate, everyone here under 50 owns at least one bike.
The town is home to the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame and it hosts the annual Fat Tire Bike Week.
This summer, the jamboree attracted more visitors than the busiest week of the town's winter ski season.
David Lindsey, chairman of the Fat Tire Bike celebration, muses that the bike's popularity may be a combination of technology and nostalgia.
"The mountain bike feels as comfortable as the ` paperboy' bike 0 you had *T*-1 as a kid, but it can do so much more," he says *T*-2.
Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind .) said 0 he and Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D .) are backing away from their proposal *PRO* to make the Treasury Secretary a voting member of the Federal Reserve panel that *T*-1 sets monetary policy.
Rep. Hamilton said 0 the bill will be modified *-1 substantially *PRO*-2 to call for two meetings each year between the Fed's open market committee and the Treasury Secretary, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
The original bill was strongly opposed *-1 by the Fed *RNR*-2 and publicly criticized *-1 by friends of the Fed *RNR*-2 as an attempt *PRO* to undermine the central bank's independence.
Fed critics, however, hailed it as a long overdue attempt *PRO* to bring a measure of openness and democracy to the setting of monetary policy.
Rep. Hamilton said 0 the purpose of the meetings would be *PRO* to "improve communications and perhaps coordination between the executive branch and the Fed."
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan meets regularly for lunch with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and talks frequently with Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
The administration officials don't ordinarily meet with the entire membership of the open market committee.
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set a date *ICH*-2 next month for general elections that some analysts say 0 *T*-1 could cost him and his ruling Congress (I) Party control of the government.
Other analysts say 0 the Indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties.
Elections in this large, diverse and passionate nation are always hard 0 *PRO* to predict *T*-1.
Much depends on the opposition, a loose group of regional and ideological parties led * by former Gandhi cabinet minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh.
The biggest certainty is that the elections will be a vote for or against Mr. Gandhi and his five years in power--five years of ups and downs, promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity.
Yesterday, four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party, Mr. Gandhi called elections for the lower house of Parliament on Nov. 22 and 24.
The elections will be held *-1 in different states on one of the two days.
(The lower house's five - year term expires in January; the Parliament's upper house is appointed *-1.)
The elections will be a rigorous test for the 45 - year - old prime minister and Congress (I), which *T*-1 in various forms has ruled for 40 of India's 42 years of independence.
After a landslide win in 1984 in polls held * after the assassination of his mother, Indira Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller coaster ride.
His early promises *PRO* to make India a modern nation remain bogged down in bloated bureaucracy.
His pledge *PRO* to clean up local administration and Indian politics, including his own party, went unfulfilled.
His "Mr. Clean" image was muddied *-1 by an arms - kickback scandal, which *T*-2 will be a major campaign issue.
Some analysts predict that disappointment in Mr. Gandhi's spent pledge *PRO* to reduce corruption and heavy - handed local government will crest at the polls.
"There's a wide feeling of indignation across the country," says *T*-1 Bhabani Sen Gupta of the Center for Policy Research, in New Delhi.
"I think 0 the people will be judging the regime by a petty policeman, by a corrupt revenue collector.
This could be a big protest against an administrative failure."
Even if the Congress (I) retains control of the government, Mr. Gandhi's ability *PRO* to push through major initiatives might be hobbled *-1 by a thinner majority.
Economic analysts call his trail - blazing liberalization of the Indian economy *PRO*-2 incomplete, and many are hoping for major new liberalizations if he is returned *-1 firmly to power.
The Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, has 542 elected *RNR*-1 and two appointed *RNR*-1 seats.
In 1984, the Congress (I) captured 405 seats, the largest victory in the history of Indian democracy.
The landslide was fueled *-1 by panic that *T*-2 prevailed in India at the time.
Mrs. Gandhi had been assassinated *-1 by separatist Sikhs, and many Indians feared 0 their country might split apart.
In the previous three general elections, similar national issues clinched the vote.
In 1971, the Congress Party won after India's victory in the Bangladesh war.
In 1977, Mrs. Gandhi was thrown *PRO*-1 out of office after her 19 - month emergency rule, and in 1980, after her successors made a mess of their three years in power, she was restored *-2 to office.
Most political analysts say that if Mr. Gandhi's opposition unites *PRO*-1 to field single candidates in most precincts, the Congress (I) will lose big.
But if the opposition remains fractured, the Congress (I) could win a small majority, or lead a coalition government.
Chimanbhai Mehta, a parliamentarian and former Gandhi ally, predicts 0 Congress (I) will win only 150 seats, a quarter of the house, if the opposition fields single candidates in 80% of the races.
Analysts say 0 the opposition will struggle this week *PRO*-1 to unite, and its success will be clear only when it announces its final list of parliamentary candidates *T*-2.
The arms - kickback scandal is likely *PRO* to be one of the big talking points in the campaign, but it *EXP*-1's unclear how it is viewed *-2 by average Indian voters *T*-3.
In 1986, India signed a $1.4 billion *U* contract with AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, *PRO* to purchase 400 artillery pieces.
The contract was negotiated by the countries' two prime ministers, and was supposed *PRO* to be free of commissions or agents' costs.
In April 1987, evidence *ICH*-2 surfaced that commissions were paid *-3.
The opposition charged that the money was used *-1 *PRO* to bribe Indian government officials, an allegation denied * by Mr. Gandhi's administration.
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven *-1 wrong by documentary evidence.
The scandal has faded and flared, but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages, and that has helped *PRO*-2 galvanize the opposition, which *T*-1 last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills.
It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated *-1.
In a country where a bribe is needed *-2 *PRO* to get a phone, a job, and even into a school *T*-1, the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government.
That illustrates the kind of disappointment 0 many Indians feel *T*-1 toward Mr. Gandhi, whom they zestfully elected *T*-2 and enthusiastically supported *T*-2 in his first two years in power.
His term has produced no spectacular failures in politics, in the economy or on the military front, and has chalked up some successes.
But the average Indian had tremendous hope in the youthful leader and his promise *PRO* to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt.
His failures in those two areas deeply, and sometimes bitterly, disappointed many Indians.
"We don't like the Congress (I)," says *T*-1 Sooraji Jath, a farmer in the western state of Gujarat.
"The Congress government is taking the farmers' bread and not giving us any support.
When there are well problems, light problems, road problems, *T*-1 the government tells us *PRO*-2 to forget it."
The greatest thing going for Mr. Gandhi and the Congress (I) Party is the poor reputation of the opposition.
Even if it unites for the elections, its coherence is likely *PRO* to be temporary.
When the Congress (I) lost the 1977 election, following Mrs. Gandhi's hated emergency rule *T*-1, a similar coalition took power and then disintegrated.
Many Indians fear a repeat of that experience.
March 24, 1986:
AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, enters into a $1.4 billion *U* contract *ICH*-1 with India's Defense Ministry *PRO* to supply 400 Bofors FH - 77B 155 - mm field howitzer guns.
In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in his talks with then Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, imposed the condition that the contract have no middlemen.
April 16, 1987:
Swedish National Radio reports that about $40 million *U*--nearly 3% of the total contract--was paid *-1 by Bofors as commissions to middlemen.
June 1, 1987:
Sweden's National Audit Bureau releases its report confirming payment of about $40 million *U* to unidentified Indians.
The report says that investigations were severely hampered *-1 by lack of cooperation from Bofors.
Bofors says 0 it can't disclose the names of the middlemen because it would jeopardize industrial confidentiality.
A portion of the report containing names of the middlemen is withheld *-1 by officials 0 *T*-2 citing bank secrecy requirements.
Aug. 6, 1987:
Prime Minister Gandhi tells the Indian Parliament, "...neither I nor any member of my family has received any consideration in these transactions.
That is the truth."
Aug. 26, 1987:
Bofors admits payments of $41 million *U* to middlemen.
April 22, 1988:
The Hindu newspaper publishes facsimiles of bank documents for foreign - exchange remittances and letters between Bofors and certain private companies related to the sale of the guns to India.
April 26, 1988:
A parliamentary investigative committee dominated * by the Congress (I) Party concludes that there were no middlemen in the deal and no payment to any Indian individual or company.
July 18, 1989:
The comptroller and auditor - general of India reports serious lapses in the government's technical and financial evaluation of the Bofors deal.
Sept. 15, 1989:
Retired army Chief of Staff Krishnaswami Sundarji discloses in an interview that he suggested in May 1987 that the government cancel the Bofors contract.
According to Gen. Sundarji, that would have forced Bofors *PRO*-2 to disclose the names of the middlemen who *T*-1 received kickbacks from the company.
His recommendation was rejected *-1 by the government.
Oct. 9. 1989:
The Hindu newspaper publishes the withheld portion of the Swedish National Audit Bureau's report.
The disclosures state that commissions were paid *-1 by Bofors to an Indian agent of the arms company.

Thomas E. Meador, 42 years old, was named *-2 *PRO*-3 president *RNR*-1 and chief operating officer *RNR*-1 of Balcor Co., a Skokie, Ill., subsidiary of this New York investment banking firm.
Balcor, which *T*-1 has interests in real estate, said 0 the position is newly created *-2.
Mr. Meador had been executive vice president of Balcor.
In addition to his previous real - estate investment and asset - management duties, Mr. Meador takes responsibility for development and property management.
Those duties had been held *-1 by Van Pell, 44, who *T*-2 resigned as an executive vice president.
Shearson is about 60% - held by American Express Co.
Thomas H. Johnson, president of the Coatedboard division of Mead Corp., was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president of Manville Forest Products Corp., a Manville unit, and senior vice president of Manville Corp.
Mr. Johnson succeeds Harry W. Sherman, who *T*-1 resigned *PRO*-2 to pursue other interests, in both positions.
Manville is a building and forest products concern.
Robert M. Jelenic, 39, was named *-2 *PRO*-3 president *RNR*-1 and chief operating officer *RNR*-1 of this closely held publisher.
The post had been vacant for more than a year.
Mr. Jelenic had been executive vice president for operations.
In addition, Ralph Ingersoll II, 43, chairman and chief executive, said 0 he would take on additional responsibilities as editor in chief of the company.
John Wilpers resigned as editor in chief.
Mr. Ingersoll remains editor in chief of the company's recently launched daily, the St. Louis Sun.
Also, Jean B. Clifton, 28, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer.
Michael Applebaum resigned after less than a year in the posts.
Ms. Clifton had been executive financial assistant to the chairman.
Fiat S.p . A., Italy's leading industrial group, is conducting "concrete" talks with West Germany's Daimler - Benz AG on a series of projects in the aerospace sector, Fiat officials said 0 *T*-1.
However, the officials said 0 it *EXP*-1 was too early *PRO* to disclose the nature of the proposed projects or indicate when the talks might be concluded *-2 *T*-3.
Daimler - Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter told Milan's financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore that talks *ICH*-2 are taking place between both companies' aerospace units.
"While Mr. Reuter's comments please us very much, there currently are no talks in progress regarding the automotive industry," a Fiat spokeswoman said *T*-1.
In the interview, Mr. Reuter said 0 he is thinking foremost of cooperation in the truck sector, but "in the long run, I don't want *PRO*-1 to rule out that we can also come a bit closer in personal cars."
Roberto Morelli, Italy analyst for County Natwest Securities in London, said that right now "the market isn't being influenced *-1 by that kind of news," *PRO* referring to the conditional nature of the talks mentioned * by Mr. Reuter and by the uncertainty surrounding world stock exchanges this week.
Cross & Trecker Corp. said 0 it reached an agreement *PRO* to sell its Wiedemann division to recently created Murata Wiedemann Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Murata Machinery Ltd. of Kyoto, Japan.
The agreement also includes the purchase of Cross & Trecker's Warner & Swasey (Switzerland) AG unit by a European affiliate of Murata Machinery.
Cross & Trecker is also selling its equity interest in a Japanese joint venture, Murata Warner Swasey, to Murata Machinery.
Cross & Trecker, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine - tool maker, said 0 the net sales price of the total transaction is $24 million *U*.
The Wiedemann division was one of three businesses put * up for sale in Cross & Trecker's restructuring program announced * in July.
Cross & Trecker said 0 negotiations *ICH*-1 are under way for the sale of another company, RobertsCorp.
An experimental vaccine can alter the immune response of people infected * with the AIDS virus, a prominent U.S. scientist said 0 *T*-1.
However, that doesn't mean 0 they can benefit from the vaccine.
Its effectiveness can't be determined *-1 until a large clinical trial is undertaken *-2 by the Army in January, according to Robert Redfield, chief of acquired immune deficiency syndrome research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.
Dr. Redfield's report on early experiments using an AIDS vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn., came at a meeting of AIDS vaccine researchers in Florida late Monday.
The vaccine, VaxSyn HIV - 1, has been safely given *-2 to 14 people, some of whom *T*-3 are experiencing substantial increases in certain antibodies.
"The conventional wisdom used *-1 to be that you couldn't modify the immune response of an infected individual" by *PRO* innoculating them with synthetic viral proteins, Dr. Redfield said 0 *T*-2.
"We've demonstrated that you can *?*."
He said 0 certain volunteers developed kinds of antibodies associated * with early AIDS.
Other antibodies sparked * by the preparation are of a sort rarely present in large quantities in infected or ill individuals, he added 0 *T*-1.
One of the mysteries of AIDS remains why infected people produce large quantities of antibodies, but deteriorate nonetheless *T*-1.
This is written *-1 *PRO* to correct a misquotation in your Oct. 3 article "Deaths From Advanced Colon Cancer Can Be Reduced *-2 by *PRO* Using Two Drugs."
In this article, I was alleged *PRO*-1 to have said, 0 "Any patient with high - risk colon cancer is really getting short shrift if he's not getting this therapy."
I didn't say this, and I'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed * by the quote.
I have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs, levamisole and 5 - fluorouracil, to any of my colon - cancer patients.
With this treatment we have reduced deaths in high - risk colon cancer by one - third--but this leaves the two - thirds who *T*-1 are dying of cancer.
This is not nearly good enough.
I believe 0 any physician who *T*-1 truly cares about cancer patients, both today and tomorrow, should offer the hope of something better than that.
My statement, read verbatim from a printed text available to all reporters attending the National Cancer Institute news conference, was the following: "New clinical trials are already in operation *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO* to improve these results.
These research protocols offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established *T*-1 today but also the hope of something still better.
I feel 0 any patient with high - risk cancer is getting short shrift if he is not offered this opportunity."
We have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead.
This hope, however, will never be realized *-1 if we use levamisole and 5 - fluorouracil as a stopping point.

MACMILLAN BLOEDEL Ltd. said 0 it borrowed 215 million Dutch guilders (US$102 million *U*) from a group of Dutch institutional investors.
MacMillan Bloedel, a Vancouver, British Columbia, forest products concern, said 0 the 8.1% loan is due Oct. 16, 1996.
Funds will be used *-1 *PRO* to repay existing short - term debt and to finance capital spending, it said 0 *T*-2.
The Boston Globe says 0 its newly redesigned pages have a "crisper" look with revamped fixtures aimed * at *PRO* making the paper "more consistent" and "easier 0 *PRO* to read *T*-1."
Maybe so--if you can find where your favorite writer went *T*-1.
Beantown scribes, who *T*-1 spare no invective when *PRO* taking on local luminaries such as Michael "Pee Wee" Dukakis, or New England Patriots Coach Raymond "Rev. Ray" Berry *T*-3, yesterday poured ridicule on new drawings of Globe columnists that *T*-2 replaced old photos in the revamped pages this week.
By late last night, Globe Managing Editor Thomas Mulvoy, *PRO*-1 bending to the will of his troops, scrapped the new drawings.
For a few days at least, he says, no pictures or drawings of any kind will adorn the columns.
Trouble was, 0 nobody thought 0 they looked right.
Globe columnist Mike Barnicle--in the second attack on his employer in as many weeks--averred that his shadowy countenance was so bad, 0 it looked "like a face 0 you'd find *T*-2 on a bottle of miracle elixir that *T*-1 promises *PRO*-3 to do away with diarrhea in our lifetime."
Mr. Barnicle reminded readers that he still hasn't forgiven Globe management for *PRO*-4 questioning a $20 *U* expense chit 0 he submitted *T*-1 for *PRO*-2 parking his car while *PRO*-3 chasing a story.
"I thought {the drawing} a cross between someone 0 you'd spot *T*-2 *PRO*-3 whipping open his trench coat...or a guy who *T*-1 boasted 0 he'd been Charles Manson's roommate for the last 19 years," he said *T*-4.
Mr. Barnicle was hardly kinder to the renderings of colleagues Michael Madden ("*PRO* appears *PRO*-2 to be a pervert"), Will McDonough ("*PRO* looks as if he drove for Abe Lincoln") or Bella English, whose "little girl *T*-1 now screams hysterically every time 0 she sees a newspaper *T*-3."
Lynn Staley, the Globe's assistant managing editor for design, acknowledges that the visages were "on the low end of the likeness spectrum."
Rival Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr, who *T*-1 usually rails at Statehouse "hacks" and nepotism, argued that the new drawings were designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to hide Mr. Madden's "rapidly growing forehead" and the facial defects of "chinless" Dan Shaughnessy, a Globe sports columnist.
"But *PRO* think of the money 0 you, the reader, will save *T*-1 on Halloween," said *T*-2 Mr. Barnicle.
"Instead of *PRO* buying masks for your kids, *PRO* just cut out the columnists' pictures....
The market for $200 billion *U* of high - yield junk bonds regained some of its footing as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday's plunge.
But the junk recovery, led * by the bellwether RJR Holdings bonds, was precarious.
No trading *ICH*-1 existed for the vast majority of junk bonds, securities industry officials said 0 *T*-2.
On Friday, trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling *PRO*-1 to provide bid and offer prices for most issues.
"Nothing traded on Friday, and people weren't really sure where the market should have opened" yesterday *T*-1, said 0 *T*-2 Raymond Minella, co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co.
"But we had a fairly active day yesterday."
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the leading underwriter of junk bonds, "I was prepared *PRO*-1 to be in a very bad mood tonight," said 0 *T*-2 David Feinman, a junk bond trader.
"Now, I feel 0 maybe there's a little bit of euphoria."
But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell - off yesterday, he said 0 *?*, "You couldn't buy {junk bonds} and you couldn't give them away."
Yesterday's rally was led *-1 by RJR Holdings 13 3/4% bonds, which initially *T*-2 tumbled three points, or $30 *U* for each $1,000 *U* face amount, to 96 1/4 before *PRO* rebounding to 99 3/4.
Bonds issued * by Kroger, Duracell, Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains, *PRO*-1 recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday.
But traders said 0 the junk bond market increasingly is separating into a top - tier group, in which trades can be executed *-1 easily *T*-2, and a larger group of lower - quality bonds in which liquidity--or the ability *PRO* to trade without too much difficulty--has steadily deteriorated this year *T*-3.
"Liquidity hasn't returned to the vast middle ground of the market," said *T*-1 Mr. Minella of Merrill.
"The deadbeats are still deadbeats," said *T*-1 Mr. Feinman of Drexel.
Analysts are concerned that much of the high - yield market will remain treacherous for investors.
Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, *PRO*-2 citing a pattern of junk - bond default rates that *T*-1 are low in the early years after issuance and rise later, says, "We're now in a period where we're starting *-3 to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 *T*-4."
Mark Bachmann, a senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., confirms that there is "increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market."
"Junk bonds are a highly stratified market," said *T*-1 Lewis Glucksman, vice chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
"There's a whole bunch of stuff that *T*-1's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that *T*-2's not so good."
Analysts at Standard & Poor's say 0 junk bond offerings by "tightly stretched" issuers seem *-1 to be growing.
Almost $8 billion *U* of junk bonds that *T*-2 are considered *-1 untradeable include issues from SCI TV, Gillette Holdings (not related to Gillette Co.), Interco, Seaman Furniture, Allied Stores, Federated Department Stores, National Gypsum, M.D.C. Holdings, Micropolis, Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications.
"You could still have some very bad times ahead," said *T*-1 Mr. Bachmann.
"It *EXP*-1's possible *PRO* to have a 10% default rate in one year, because we're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy.
I'm certainly not comfortable *PRO*-1 saying 0 we've seen the bottom."
But yesterday's rally among "good" junk was a badly needed tonic for the market.
Many issues "bounced off the floor," Mr. Minella said 0 *?*, and benchmark junk issues "recovered all of their losses" from Friday and early yesterday.
In contrast, he says 0 *?*, "The stock market gained back only about half what it lost *T*-1 Friday, and the {government} bond market lost about half what it gained *T*-2 Friday."
Traders said 0 yesterday's rally was fueled *-1 by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month.
In addition, mutual funds didn't appear *-2 to be major sellers of high - yield securities as *PRO* was expected *-1.
"Sometimes a shakeout is healthy," said *T*-1 Drexel's Mr. Feinman.
"People will learn *PRO*-1 to be more circumspect.
If they do good credit analysis, they will avoid the hand grenades.
I think 0 the market is in good shape.
President Bush chose Martin Allday, a longtime friend from Texas, *PRO*-1 to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Mr. Allday would succeed Martha Hesse, who *T*-1 is resigning.
The White House said 0 Ms. Hesse, a Chicago businesswoman who *T*-1 previously held posts at the Energy Department and FERC, is leaving *PRO*-2 to become a vice president of First Chicago Corp.
Mr. Allday, an attorney in Midland, Texas, has been solicitor at the Interior Department.
He met Mr. Bush in the 1950s, when the president was a young oil man in Midland *T*-1 and Mr. Allday was a lawyer for an oil firm *T*-1.
The FERC is a five - member commission that *T*-1 regulates billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions.
Mr. Allday's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate.
Administration officials said 0 a date for Ms. Hesse's departure hasn't been set *-1.
After two years of drought, it rained money in the stock - index futures markets yesterday.
As financial markets rebounded, trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's huge Standard & Poor's 500 stock - index futures pit soared, *PRO*-1 reaching near - record levels for the first time since October 1987.
The sudden influx of liquidity enabled several traders *PRO*-2 to reap six - figure windfalls in a matter of minutes as prices soared, traders said *T*-1.
"Guys were minting money in there today," said *T*-1 John Legittino, a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago.
The S&P 500 futures contract, which *T*-1 moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions, jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn, then moved strongly higher the rest of the day.
Each index point represents a $500 *U* profit for each S&P 500 contract held *.
For the first time since the 1987 crash, traders said that they were able *PRO*-1 to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market.
Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock - index futures, *PRO*-1 blaming them for *PRO* speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago.
Since the crash, many futures traders haven't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market, with much of its customer order flow missing, would dry up if prices turned against them.
More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit *PRO*-1 to await the opening bell.
Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
The contract fell five points *ICH*-2 at the open to 323.85, the maximum opening move allowed * under safeguards adopted * by the Merc *PRO* to stem a market slide.
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts, *PRO* driving prices sharply higher.
The market hovered near Friday's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour, *PRO*-1 moving several index points higher or lower in seconds, then broke higher and didn't look back.
The S&P 500 contract that *T*-1 expires in December closed up a record 15.65 points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts.
"Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that *T*-1 were a full point apart," said *T*-2 one S&P 500 broker.
"You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune," he marveled *T*-1.
Several of Wall Street's largest securities firms, including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc., were also large buyers, traders said 0 *T*-1.
Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock - index futures last week, traders said 0 *T*-1.
Brokerage firms as a rule don't comment on their market activity.
Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago, individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being uncharacteristically circumspect about their one - day profits.
"With the FBI around here, bragging rights are a thing of the past," said *T*-1 one trader, *PRO*-2 referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far *T*-3 has resulted in 46 indictments lodged * against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade.
George W. Koch, 63 years old, president and chief executive officer of Grocery Manufacturers of America Inc., was elected *-1 *PRO*-3 a director of this maker of spices, seasonings and specialty foods, *PRO*-1 succeeding Erskin N. White Jr., 65, who *T*-2 resigned.
Robert P. Bulseco, 44 years old, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief administrative officer of this regional commercial bank.
Both posts had been vacant.
Robert Robie, 51, was named *-1 to the new positions of vice chairman and chief credit officer.
G. William Ryan, president of Post-Newsweek Stations, was named *-1 *PRO*-2 chief executive officer of the unit of this media company, effective Jan. 1.
He will succeed Joel Chaseman, who *T*-1 will remain a vice president of the company and continue *-2 to represent Post-Newsweek stations in several industry organizations, the company said 0 *T*-3.
MEDUSA Corp. said 0 it voluntarily prepaid $7 million *U* on its original $75 million *U* term loan, *PRO* bringing the total debt reduction for the year to $18 million *U*.
After the payment, the Cleveland company owes $57 million *U* on the loan.
The cement producer said 0 the payment was made *-1 from excess cash flow.
Britain's industrial production rose 1.5% in August from July and was up 0.9% from August 1988, according to provisional data from the Central Statistical Office.
Output in the energy sector, which *T*-1 can vary greatly with swings in the oil market, rose 3.8% in August from May but was down 7.1% from a year earlier.
The latest figures compare with July's 4.5% month - to - month rise and 11.3% year - to - year fall.
a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self - deceived English butler in his sixties--proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves.
In fact, Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the Day" (Knopf, 245 pages, $18.95 *U*) is both an homage to traditional English forms and a dramatic critique of them.
It implies that the British Empire was rooted *-1 in its subjects' minds, manners and morals, and argues, tacitly, that its self - destructive flaws were embodied *-2 in the defensive snobbery, willful blindness, role - playing and especially the locutions of its domestic servants.
As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul *T*-1.
Stevens's dutiful conflation of the public and private realms--like his beloved master's--destroys all 0 it was designed *PRO*-1 to preserve *T*-2.
Such armor crushes the soldier.
The mask cuts to the quick.
It's 1956, the year 0 the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire *T*-1.
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six - day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall, where a former housekeeper *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 resides *T*-4, perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20 - year marriage, perhaps (he hopes with more fervor than he will ever acknowledge) not disinclined *PRO* to return to domestic service, Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self - portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel 0 we're reading *T*-3:
"We call this land of ours *PRO*-2 Great Britain, and there may be those who *T*-1 believe this a somewhat immodest practice.
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective....
It is the very lack of obvious drama or spectacle that *T*-1 sets the beauty of our land apart.
What *T*-1 is pertinent is the calmness of that beauty, its sense of restraint.
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, of its own greatness, and feels no need *PRO* to shout it.
In comparison, the sorts of sights offered * in such places as Africa and America, though undoubtedly very exciting, would, I am sure, strike the objective viewer as inferior on account of their unseemly demonstrativeness."
An effusive landscape?
An ill - mannered mountain?
But *PRO* let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner (his conscious efforts at "banter" always fail--most comically): "This whole question is very akin to the question that *T*-1 has caused much debate in our profession over the years: what *T*-2 is a ` great' butler?"
His answer is one "possessed * of a dignity in keeping with his position."
Such dignity "has *-2 to do crucially with a butler's ability *PRO* not to abandon the professional being 0 he inhabits *T*-1."
He "will not be shaken *-1 out by external events, however surprising, alarming or vexing....
Continentals are unable *PRO*-1 to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of *T*-2."
Despite his racial advantage, *PRO* to be a great butler is a heroic calling; one's pantry is "not unlike general's headquarters during a battle."
If, for example, in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on *PRO* revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen *-1 to die of a stroke, one must continue *-2 to serve the port: "Please *PRO* don't think me unduly improper in *PRO*-4 not ascending *PRO*-3 to see my father in his deceased condition just at this moment.
You see, I know 0 my father would have wished me to carry on just now."
It is this kind of dignity and restraint that *T*-1 allows Stevens to declare: "For all its sad associations, whenever I recall that evening today *T*-2, I find 0 I do so with a large sense of triumph."
We note the imperial public word used * *PRO* to deny private rage and sorrow.
That Stevens himself is not grotesque or repellent, but funny and sad and enlightening, is entirely the author's triumph.
Mr. Ishiguro's ability *PRO* to create a fallible narrative voice that *T*-1 permits him *PRO*-2 to explore such intertwining domestic, cultural and political themes was abundantly clear in his previous novel, "An Artist of the Floating World," set * in Japan after the war.
Now *PRO*-2 shifting his scene from the country 0 he left *T*-1 at five to the England 0 he has lived in *T*-3 for nearly 30 years, he has fashioned a novel in the mode of Henry James and E.M. Forster.
With great aplomb he considers not only filial devotion and (utterly repressed) sexual love, but British anti-Semitism, the gentry's impatience with democracy and support of Hitler, and the moral problematics of loyalty: "It is, in practice, simply not possible *PRO* to adopt such a critical attitude towards an employer and at the same time provide good service....
` This employer embodies all that I find *T*-1 noble and admirable.
I will hereafter devote myself to *PRO* serving him.
' This is loyalty intelligently bestowed *."
In the end, after *PRO* meeting with the former housekeeper, Stevens sits by the seashore at dusk, *PRO*-1 thinking of her and of his employer, and declares "I trusted.
I trusted in his lordship's wisdom....
I can't even say 0 I made my own mistakes.
Really--one has *-1 to ask oneself--what dignity is there *T*-2 in that?"
The loyal servant has come full circle.
What is greatness *T*-1?
What is dignity *T*-1?
We understand 0 such rueful wisdom must be retrospective: The owl of Minerva only spreads her wings at dusk.
But as "The Remains of the Day" so eloquently demonstrates with quiet virtuosity, such wisdom can be movingly embodied *-1 in art.
Mr. Locke teaches English and comparative literature at Columbia University.
Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert.
It attracts people with funny hair (or with no hair--in front of me a girl with spiked locks sat beside a boy who *T*-1 had shaved his).
Whoever *T*-1 constitute the local Left Bank come out in force, *PRO*-3 dressed in black, along with a smattering of yuppies who *T*-2 want *PRO*-4 to be on the cutting edge.
People in Glass houses tend *-1 to look stoned.
And, if still conscious at the evening's end, you notice something else: The audience, at first entranced and hypnotized by the music, releases its pent - up feelings in collective gratitude.
Currently in the middle of a four - week, 20 - city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of *PRO*-1 going it alone.
He sits down at the piano and plays.
And *PRO* plays.
Either one likes it or one doesn't *?*.
The typical Glass audience, which *T*-2 is more likely *PRO*-3 to be composed *-1 of music students than their teachers, certainly does *?*.
The work, though, sounds like Muzak for spaceships.
Philip Glass is the emperor *RNR*-1, and his music the new clothes *RNR*-1, of the avant - garde.
His success is easy 0 *PRO* to understand *T*-1.
*PRO*-1 Softly introducing and explaining his pieces, Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a shaggy poet describing his work than a classical pianist playing a recital.
The piano compositions, which *T*-2 have been labeled *-1 variously as minimalist, Oriental, repetitive, cyclical, monophonic and hypnotic, are relentlessly tonal (therefore unthreatening), unvaryingly rhythmic (therefore soporific), and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic (therefore both pretty and unconventional).
It is music for people who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to hear something different but don't want *PRO*-2 to work especially hard at the task.
It is E-Z listening for the now generation.
Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum "less is more."
His more is always less.
Far from *PRO*-1 being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised * in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions.
But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex.
"Opening" (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique: *PRO*-1 Never straying too far from the piano's center, Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys.
There is a recognizable musical style here, but not a particular performance style.
The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it *EXP*-2's hard *PRO* to imagine a bad performance of it.
Nothing bravura, no arpeggios, no ticklish fingering problems challenge the performer.
We hear, we may think, inner voices, but they all seem *-1 to be saying the same thing.
With "Planet News," music meant *PRO* to accompany readings of Allen Ginsberg's "Wichita Vortex Sutra," Mr. Glass gets going.
His hands sit farther apart on the keyboard.
Seventh chords make you feel as though he may break into a (very slow) improvisatory riff.
The chords modulate, but there is little filigree even though his fingers begin *-1 to wander over more of the keys.
Contrasts predictably accumulate: First the music is loud, then it becomes soft, then (you realize) it becomes louder again.
"The Fourth Knee Play," an interlude from "Einstein on the Beach," is like a toccata but it doesn't seem *-1 to move much beyond its left - hand ground in "Three Blind Mice."
When Mr. Glass decides *PRO*-1 to get really fancy *T*-2, he crosses his hands and hits a resonant bass note with his right hand.
He does this in at least three of his solo pieces.
You might call it *PRO*-1 a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment.
In "Mad Rush," which *T*-1 came from a commission *PRO* to write a piece of indeterminate length (Mr. Glass charmingly, and tellingly, confessed that "this was no problem for me"), an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends *PRO*-2 unresolved.
Not only is the typical Glasswork open - ended, it is also often multiple in its context (s).
"Mad Rush" began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine *T*-1.
Later it was performed *-1 on Radio Bremen in Germany, and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces.
The point is that any piece can be used *-1 as background music for virtually anything.
The evening ended with Mr. Glass's "Metamorphosis," another multiple work.
Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line," and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name.
When *PRO* used *-1 as background in this way *T*-2, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two - note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film *T*-3.
*PRO*-2 Served *-1 up as a solo, however, the music lacks the resonance provided * by a context within another medium.
Admirers of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard Kostelanetz's sense that the 1974 "Music in Twelve Parts" is as encyclopedic and weighty as "The Well - Tempered Clavier."
But while *PRO*-1 making the obvious point that both composers develop variations from themes, this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music.
Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that *T*-1 makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even *T*-2 seems like concision in Mahler.
Mr. Spiegelman is professor of English at Southern Methodist University and editor of the Southwest Review.
The Pentagon is a haunted house.
*PRO* Living there for six years was really scary.
The ghosts of the past are everywhere: They are kept *-1 at bay only by *PRO* feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget.
Some can be bought *-1 off relatively cheaply.
During the Korean War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur demanded and got, in addition to his U.N. command in Korea, his own naval command in Japan, NavforJapan.
Those obsolete operations cost less than $2 billion *U* a year, and keep Mac's ghost *PRO*-1 quiet.
That's about all 0 it costs *T*-1 *PRO* to appease Adm. Erich Raeder's ghost.
In 1941, Raeder and the German navy threatened *PRO*-1 to attack the Panama Canal, so we created the Southern Command in Panama.
The Southern Command has grown even bigger since the war because Raeder's ghost sometimes runs through the E ring *PRO*-1 dressed like Gen. Noriega.
The Command's huge bureaucracy is needed *-1 *PRO*-1 to analyze whether leaders of coups against Gen. Noriega meet the War Powers Act's six points, Cap Weinberger's seven points, the Intelligence Committee's 32 points and Woodrow Wilson's 14 points necessary *PRO* to justify U.S. support.
So far no one has *?*.
The ghost of the Soviet brigade discovered * in Cuba back in the '70s costs just a few hundred million: the price of the Caribbean Command in Key West that President Carter created *T*-1 in 1980.
The brigade hasn't been heard from *-1 since, but we keep the staff around just in case.
George Marshall's ghost is much more difficult *PRO* to keep *?* *PRO*-1 happy.
We keep a lot of shrines to him *ICH*-1 around the Pentagon: statues, busts, relics and such.
The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used *-1 to burn a lot of incense to him, but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it.
You see, Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines--he wanted *PRO*-1 to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal blocked him.
Now his ghost won't let up till it's done *-1.
*PRO*-1 To keep him *PRO*-4 quiet we invent a new unified command *ICH*-3 every year or so run * by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it.
But we still hear him moaning at night because the Navy has a few ships left, and *PRO* to satisfy him the Navy's sea lift forces were given *-1 to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois, its space operations to another command in Colorado, the frogmen to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort Bragg, and the Navy's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida.
Which *T*-1 brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all--the ghost of the shah of Iran.
When the shah died *T*-1, President Carter was so scared that the shah's ghost would blame him for *PRO* shoving him out *PRO* to make way for the ayatollah that he declared the Carter Doctrine.
Mr. Carter said 0 he would go to war *PRO*-2 to stop anyone from *PRO* trying *PRO*-1 to grab Iran.
But that ghost wouldn't settle for words, he wanted money and people--lots.
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called * *PRO*-1 the Rapid Deployment Force.
But that ghost wasn't fooled *-1; he knew 0 the RDF was neither rapid nor deployable nor a force--even though it cost $8 billion *U* or $10 billion *U* a year.
After Mr. Carter was defeated *-1 in 1980, the shah's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and Cap Weinberger.
I saw what he did *T*-1 to them firsthand.
It made my shoelaces dance with terror.
Why, he used *-1 to lay in wait for Cap; suddenly he'd leap from behind some statue of Marshall onto Cap's chest and grab him by the throat and choke him till he coughed up an additional $2 billion *U* or so.
Cap added four more divisions *ICH*-5 to the Army, two active and two reserve; two carrier groups to the Navy; a division--equivalent to the Marines; and the C - 5B, KC - 10, C - 17 and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force.
He bought $4 billion *U* in prepositioning ships and $7 billion *U* in ammo and equipment 0 *T*-1 to fill them, and parked them at a new $6 billion *U* base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean.
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf.
One night both Marshall's ghost and the shah's ghost together caught Cap and threw him to the ground.
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it *PRO*-1 Central Command.
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.
Marshall figured 0 it would be good training for those soldiers--someday maybe they would get the whole Navy.
They had fun *PRO*-1 moving the carriers around, but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine sweepers.
But the shah still kept *-1 leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $7 billion *U* of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains.
Then suddenly Ike's ghost came *PRO*-1 to visit and said, "What the hell are you doing *T*-2 *PRO*-3 planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away?
We'd get our asses kicked *-1."
Lucky for Cap, Ike was easygoing and soon went away, while the shah--he kept *-1 coming back.
So the U.S. found itself *PRO*-1 paying about $2 billion *U* in baksheesh to various Arab potentates for basing rights around the Indian Ocean.
We had great success in Somalia.
But then it turned out that President Siad Barrah was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base 0 he promised us *T*-1 in Berbera had silted up about a hundred years ago and anyway was 1,244 miles from the mouth of the Gulf.
(But who *T*-1's counting.)
Still, Berbera was the best 0 we could get *T*-1, so we stay in bed with President Barrah.
All these reports about him committing genocide are probably exaggerated anyway.
But wouldn't you know, now that we are spending jillions of dollars, and have built those new divisions and new air wings, and have positioned all these ships and supplies *PRO*-2 to fight the Russians in Iran, the Russians seem *-1 to have lost interest in the whole subject.
Meanwhile, Congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget.
Predictably, some Navy guys said: "Do we still need *-1 to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land - based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa?
Couldn't we save $20 billion *U* or $30 billion *U* a year by *PRO* shifting that stuff to the reserves?
And why *PRO* not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by *PRO* abolishing Central Command and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs *T*-2, afloat with the task force commander in the Gulf *T*-1?
And where were *T*-2 all our handsomely paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our convoys were being attacked *-1 *T*-3?"
Questions like that really stir up Marshall's ghost.
He appeared late one night in the bedroom of the new defense secretary, Dick Cheney.
Marshall came *PRO*-1 clanking in like Marley's ghost dragging those chains of brigades and air wings and links with Arab despots.
He wouldn't leave until Mr. Cheney promised *PRO*-2 to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him *T*-1.
So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that: He canceled the 600 - ship Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 frigates.
Then he canceled production of the Navy's most important carrier aircraft, the F - 14 and the A - 6.
On the other hand, Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces.
Marshall's ghost is satisfied for now, but he'll be back.
What with Halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming, more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are crawling under their desks.
They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by *PRO* cutting carriers and ships.
Then the whole thing will start *-1 to collapse, just as it did *?* in the 1970s, and the ghosts and banshees will be howling through the place *PRO*-2 turning people's hair *PRO*-3 white.
Gives me the willies *PRO* just thinking about it.
Mr. Lehman, a Reagan Navy secretary, is a managing director of PaineWebber.
Polaroid Corp.'s patent - infringement damages case against Eastman Kodak Co., one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever, is getting scant attention on Wall Street.
After 78 days of mind - numbing testimony in federal court in Boston, the trial is being all but ignored *-1 by analysts and patent attorneys.
Most have read the pre-trial documents, however, and estimate 0 Kodak will be ordered *-1 *PRO*-2 to pay $1 billion to $1.5 billion *U* for *PRO* infringing on seven Polaroid patents.
That may be the largest patent award ever, but it is well below the $12 billion *U* 0 Polaroid seeks *T*-1.
The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986, when Smith International Inc. was ordered *-1 *PRO*-3 to pay $205 million *U* to Baker Hughes Inc. for *PRO* infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal *T*-2.
The two companies later agreed *PRO*-1 to settle for $95 million *U*.
Few analysts think 0 it *EXP*-1 is worth their time *PRO* to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony.
"It's like *PRO* panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station.
You might find something, but the chances are low," said *T*-1 Michael Ellman, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co.
And Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: "If you hired an attorney 0 *T*-1 to be there all the time and give you a (prediction) of the eventual award, I would be willing *PRO*-2 to bet that he would be off" by a lot.
A 75 - day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak, based * in Rochester, N.Y., infringed on patents of Polaroid, of Cambridge, Mass.
The main issues remaining are how *PRO* to calculate damages *T*-1 and whether the infringement was "willful and deliberate."
If so, the damages could be tripled *-1.
Two analysts who *T*-1 have read the transcripts, David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Calvert D. Crary, a litigation analyst at Labe, Simpson & Co., think 0 Judge A. David Mazzone will decide in Kodak's favor on the "willful and deliberate" issue.
Mr. Crary said 0 testimony by Kodak's patent counsel, Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon, showed that "he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project" in an effort *PRO* to avoid infringement.
"Carr told Kodak on many occasions *PRO* to avoid various features because of Polaroid's patent positions," and Kodak followed his advice in every instance, Mr. Crary said *T*-1.
But Irving Kayton, a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who *T*-2 is familiar with the case, said 0 the fact that seven patents were infringed *-1 "suggests 0 that infringement was willful.
It *EXP*-1's difficult *PRO* to be that consistently wrong."
Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost - profits method of *PRO* determining damages, which Polaroid favors *T*-1 because it would result in a larger award, or the reasonable royalty method.
Polaroid claims 0 it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold * by Kodak if Kodak hadn't entered the market.
Moreover, Polaroid contends 0 it could have sold them at a higher price--and thus made higher profits--because it wouldn't have been forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to match Kodak's lower prices.
Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor 0 *T*-1 to testify on that issue.
Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan.
"There's nothing that *T*-1 says that people at Harvard Business school have *-2 to agree with each other," said *T*-3 Mr. Buzzell.
Testimony is expected *-1 to continue until early December.
A decision isn't expected *-1 until some time next year.
Should you really own stocks?
That's a question 0 a lot of people are asking *T*-1, following the stock market's stunning display of volatility.
*PRO*-1 Whipsawed financially and emotionally by Friday's heartstopping 190 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday's 88 - point rebound, they're wondering if an individual has any business *PRO* being in the market.
The answer, say 0 *?* academic researchers, money managers and investment specialists, is yes--as long as you approach the stock market as an investor.
But, they say 0 *?*, people shouldn't try *PRO*-3 to be traders, who *T*-1 buy and sell in an effort *PRO* to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock.
The case for *PRO* owning stocks over the long - term is compelling.
"If you look at 75 years worth of investment history--including the Great Depression and every bear market since--stocks have outperformed almost everything 0 an individual could have owned *T*-1 by a long shot," says *T*-2 Barry Berlin, vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management.
A dollar invested * in the stock market in 1926 would have grown to $473.29 *U* by the end of last June, according to Laurence Siegel, managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc.
But a dollar invested * in long - term bonds in 1926 would have grown to only $16.56 *U*, and a dollar put * in Treasury bills would equal a meager $9.29 *U*.
The longer the time period, the less risk 0 there is *T*-2 of *PRO* losing money in the stock market.
Over time, the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio.
For instance, Ken Gregory, a San Francisco money manager, calculates that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that *T*-1 tracks the Standard & Poor's 500 - stock index, the chance of *PRO* losing money is 3% to 4% *U* over a 10 - year period, compared with 15% over three years and 30% over one year.
"If you don't need the money for 10 years, there's a clear - cut case for *PRO* sticking to a steady core of stocks," Mr. Gregory says *T*-1.
Stock - market investments also help *PRO*-2 balance the other assets 0 an individual owns *T*-1, says 0 *T*-3 John Blankenship Jr., president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners.
Stocks have a place in an investors' portfolio along with real estate, bonds, international securities and cash, he says 0 *T*-1.
There are some important caveats: Before *PRO* investing in stocks, individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set * aside in the bank, most investment advisers say 0 *T*-1.
Individuals also should focus on *PRO* building equity in a home, which *T*-2 provides some protection against inflation, as well as a nest - egg that *T*-3 can be cashed *-1 in late in life *PRO*-1 to help *PRO*-4 cover the cost of retirement living.
People also shouldn't invest money *ICH*-1 in stocks that they'll need *T*-2 in the near future--for example, for college tuition payments or retirement expenses.
"You may have *-1 to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge *T*-2," says *T*-3 Mr. Blankenship, a Del Mar, Calif. financial planner.
But once the basics are covered *-1, "then I would start *-2 to invest, even if it's as little as $1,000 *U*," says 0 *T*-3 Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
He says 0 individuals should consider not just stocks, but other long - term investments, such as high - quality bonds.
Despite the strong case for stocks, however, most pros warn that individuals shouldn't try *PRO*-1 to profit from short - term developments.
"It's very difficult 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2," says *T*-1 Donald Holt, a market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities, a Los Angeles brokerage firm.
"Our markets move so fast *RNR*-2 and they are so volatile *RNR*-2, 0 there's no way 0 the average investor can compete with the pros *T*-1."
Individual investors face high transaction costs of *PRO* moving in and out of the market.
The cost of *PRO* executing stock orders varies from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order, but 2% of the order's value is an average, says 0 *T*-1 Stephen Boesel, manager of T. Rowe Price's Growth and Income mutual fund.
And *PRO* assuming 0 their first investment is successful, investors will have *-1 to pay taxes on their gains.
That can reduce returns by a third or more, once local taxes are included *-1, Mr. Lipper says 0 *T*-2.
After that, individual traders face the risk that the new investment 0 they choose *T*-2 won't perform well--so their trading costs could be sustained *-1 for nothing.
"It *EXP*-1's very tough for most individuals to out - trade the mutual funds or the market," says *T*-2 Mr. Lipper.
"You should really think twice if you think 0 you can out - smart the system."
Then, too, many individual investors lack the sturdy emotional makeup 0 professionals say 0 *T*-2 is needed *-1 *PRO* to plunge in and out of the market.
So what *T*-1's the best way 0 *PRO* to buy stocks *T*-2?
"Unless an individual has a minimum of between $50,000 and $100,000 *U* 0 *T*-1 to invest in stocks, he's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks, in terms of *PRO* getting enough attention from a competent broker," says *T*-2 Mr. Lipper.
Still, he adds 0 *?*, "I could see *PRO* owning both, given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in *PRO* spotting special situations based on their own insights," he adds *T*-1.
George Douglas, first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., says that individuals have a particular edge now in "small to medium - size niche companies with exciting earnings prospects"--a traditional stomping ground for small investors.
This growth sector, which usually *T*-1 carries a price / earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor's 500, happens *-2 to include some of the market's most attractive bargains right now.
"It's now selling at a multiple about even with the market," says *T*-1 Mr. Douglas.
Moreover, Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that *T*-1 could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term.
Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who *T*-1 eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now resuming coverage of this area, he notes 0 *T*-2.
"We're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks," he says *T*-1.
The pros strenuously advise individuals *PRO*-1 to stay away from the latest investment fad.
They say 0 that's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle, when there's no robust bull market *PRO*-1 to bail investors out of their mistakes *T*-2.
Friday's correction presents "a pretty good buying opportunity, but *PRO* let's not speculate at this point in the business cycle," says 0 *T*-1 Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp.
"*PRO* Buy stocks on weakness for their long - term fundamentals," he says *T*-1.
In the long run, investment advisers say 0 *?*, most investors will be better off *PRO* using the dollar - cost averaging method of *PRO* buying stocks.
In this method, a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down.
That cuts the risk, Mr. Gregory, the San Francisco money manager, points out *T*-1.
"When the market is low *T*-1, you are buying more shares, and when it's high *T*-2, you're buying fewer shares," he says *T*-3.
Otherwise, if you put all your money in at one time, by sheer bad luck, you might pick a terrible time, and have *-1 to wait three years *PRO*-2 to get even, Mr. Gregory says 0 *T*-3.
A disciplined program will work the best, Mr. Boesel says 0 *T*-1.
"One of the hardest things 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 is *PRO* to buy stocks when the market is down *T*-2," he says *T*-3.
"But that's just the time when you should be buying them *T*-1."

National Geographic, the sixth - largest U.S. magazine, is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy, high - toned pages that upscale advertisers love *T*-1.
So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10% and ad revenue by 7.2% in the first half *T*-3?
*PRO* To hear advertisers tell it, the magazine just hasn't kept up with the times.
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World, it hasn't been able *PRO*-1 to shake its reputation as a magazine 0 boys like *PRO*-2 to flip through *T*-3 in search of topless tribe women.
Worse, it lagged behind competitors in *PRO* offering now - standard gimmicks, from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers.
But now, the magazine is attempting *PRO*-1 to fight back, with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign.
Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says 0 *T*-2 Joan McCraw, who *T*-1 joined in April as national advertising director.
"What we want *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* take a more aggressive stance.
People didn't believe 0 we were in tune with the marketplace, and in many ways we weren't *?*."
The 101 - year - old magazine has never had *-1 to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before.
It largely rested on its hard - 0 *PRO* to - fault *T*-1 demographics: 10.8 million subscribers in the first half, up from 10.5 million a year ago; an average age of 42 for readers--at the height of their consuming years; loyalty to the tune of an 85% average subscription renewal rate.
The magazine had its best year yet in 1988, when it celebrated its centennial *T*-1 and racked up a 17% gain in ad pages, to 283 *T*-1.
But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died *T*-1, so too did *T*-2 some advertiser interest.
The reason, ad executives say 0 *?*, is that the entire magazine business has been soft--and National Geographic has some quirks that *T*-1 make it especially unattractive during a soft market.
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices--$130,000 *U* for a four - color page, vs. $47,000 *U* for the Smithsonian, a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation.
When ad dollars are tight *T*-1, the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers, who generally *T*-2 want *PRO*-3 to appear regularly in a publication or not at all.
Even though National Geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like Smithsonian *?*, "the page costs you an arm and a leg *PRO*-2 to develop any frequency," says 0 *T*-1 Harry Glass, New York media manager for Bozell Inc.
*PRO*-1 To combat that problem, National Geographic, like other magazines, began *-1 offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines--for example, ads can run only in the magazines sent * to subscribers in the largest 25 markets.
But the magazine was slower *ICH*-1 than its competitors *PRO* to come up with its regional editions, and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors *?*.
Time magazine, for example, has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions, top management, and other groups.
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of *PRO* lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than spreading ads out among its articles, as most magazines do *?*.
And National Geographic's smaller - than - average size means extra production costs for advertisers.
But Ms. McCraw says 0 the magazine is fighting back.
It now offers 30 regional editions, it very recently began *-1 running ads adjacent to articles, and it has been beefing up its sales force.
And it just launched a promotional campaign 0 *T*-1 to tell chief executives, marketing directors, and media executives just that.
The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign, into which the magazine will pour about $500,000 *U*, mostly in the next few weeks *T*-1.
The campaign, created * by Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency, takes advantage of the eye - catching photography that National Geographic is known *-1 for *T*-2.
In one ad, a photo of the interior of the Sainte - Chapelle in Paris is paired *-1 with the headline, "The only book more respected than ours doesn't accept advertising."
Another ad pictures a tree ant, magnified * 80 times, with the headline, "For impact far beyond your size *PRO* consider our regional editions."
Ms. McCraw says 0 she wants the campaign to help *PRO*-1 attract advertisers in 10 categories, including corporate, financial services, consumer electronics, insurance and food.
Her goal: *PRO* to top 300 ad pages in 1990, up from about 274 this year.
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain.
"The ad campaign is meant *-1 to contemporize the thought of National Geographic," she says *T*-2.
"We want it to be a '90s kind of image."
WCRS Plans Ad - Unit Sale
WCRS Group hopes *PRO*-1 to announce, perhaps today, an agreement *PRO* to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris - based Eurocom, a European ad executive said 0 *T*-2.
WCRS has been in discussions with Eurocom for several months.
However, when negotiations bogged down recently *T*-1, WCRS's chief executive, Peter Scott, met in Paris with another French firm, Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, or BDDP.
According to the executive, BDDP's involvement prompted renewed vigor in the WCRS - Eurocom talks and the two agencies were hoping *PRO*-1 to hammer out details by today.
Executives of the two agencies couldn't be reached *-1 last night.
Ad Notes....
NEW ACCOUNT: Procter & Gamble Co., Cincinnati, awarded the ad accounts for its line of Professional Crisco vegetable shortening and oil products to Northlich, Stolley, LaWarre, Cincinnati.
Billings weren't disclosed *-1.
Professional Crisco products are specially made *-1 for the foodservice industry.
WHO *T*-2'S NEWS: Stephen Novick, 49, was named *-1 *PRO*-3 executive vice president, deputy creative director at Grey Advertising, New York.
He was executive vice president, director of broadcast production.
No strikeout, but certainly no home run.
That's how the stock - picking game is shaping up for the months ahead *T*-1, according to money managers and a few brokers.
Yesterday's 88 - point recovery from Friday's megadrop in the Dow Jones industrials had many brokerage houses proclaiming that stocks are a good bargain again.
But quite a few money managers aren't buying it.
Weakening corporate earnings, they say 0 *?*, are no prescription for a bull market.
"The stock market ain't going *-2 to do much of anything" for a while, says 0 *T*-3 John Neff of Wellington Management, who *T*-1 runs the $8.3 billion *U* Windsor Fund.
He suspects that Friday's market decline may have a second leg, perhaps a 10% to 15% drop later on.
Mr. Neff says 0 the stock market has lost some powerful driving forces, namely earnings growth and the "LBO sweepstakes"--buy - out fever that *T*-1 induced investors *PRO*-2 to bid up whole groups of stocks, such as media and airlines.
After *PRO*-1 sitting with 20% of his fund in cash before Friday's sell - off, Mr. Neff says 0 he bought "a narrow list of stocks" yesterday.
With flat corporate profits on the horizon for 1990, money managers say 0 price - earnings multiples that *T*-1 look cheap today might go on *PRO*-2 being cheap for a long time.
"This is not a grossly overvalued market, but it's not cheap either," says *T*-1 George Collins, president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
According to Institutional Brokers Estimate System, Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4% jump in company profits in 1990--unlike in 1987, when profits a year out looked good *T*-1 (they did soar 36% in 1988).
Bulls say 0 the market is an incredible bargain, *PRO*-1 priced at only about 12 times estimated 1989 earnings for stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Before the 1987 crash, the P / E was more than 20.
The common view, says 0 *?* Abby Cohen, strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, is that there will be "mild economic growth, modest profit expansion, and things are going *-2 to be hunky - dory.
Our view is that we may see a profit decline."
Some think 0 investors should sell into rallies.
The market "is going *-2 to wind down," says 0 *T*-1 Gerald W. Perritt, a Chicago money manager.
"Things are a little less overpriced" after Friday's jolt in the market.
He expects stocks to decline an additional 5% to 30%, with the Dow perhaps bottoming out between 2000 and 2100 "between now and June."
After Friday's decline, Mr. Perritt's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high - quality stocks, *PRO*-2 using old - fashioned value criteria devised * by Benjamin Graham, an analyst and author in the 1930s and 1940s who *T*-1 is widely considered *PRO*-3 to be the father of modern securities analysis.
He found 85 still overvalued * and 15 fairly valued *.
Nicholas Parks, a New York money manager, expects the market to decline about 15%.
"I've been two - thirds in cash since July, and I continue *-1 to think that *PRO* having a defensive position is appropriate," he says *T*-2.
Companies that *T*-1 piled on debt in leveraged buy - outs during the past two years "will continue *-2 to surface as business problems."
"Generalizations about value aren't useful," says *T*-1 New York money manager John LeFrere of Delta Capital Management.
For instance, he says 0 *?*, International Business Machines and Unisys might look cheap, but investors might continue *-2 to do better with stocks like Walt Disney, Procter & Gamble and Coca - Cola, strong performers in recent years.
Money manager Robert Ross, head of Duncan Ross Associates Ltd. in Vancouver, British Columbia, says 0 stocks would have *-1 to fall 15% to 20% before they are competitive with less risky investment alternatives.
Fredric Russell, a money manager in Tulsa, Okla., says 0 Friday's cave - in "is going *-1 to have more of a permanent impact on the psyche of many investors than Wall Street would want *PRO*-2 to admit."
There are still bulls out there.
"I still think 0 we will have a 3000 Dow, whether it's six months *RNR*-3 or 12 months *RNR*-3 from now I don't know *T*-1," says *T*-2 David Dreman, managing partner of Dreman Value Management in New York.
"We're doing a little buying" in some stocks "that *T*-2 have really been smashed *-1 down."
Many brokerage house officials also are optimistic.
Yesterday, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter all increased the proportion of assets 0 they recommend 0 investors commit *T*-1 to stocks.
Dean Witter now recommends 85%, Goldman 65% and Merrill Lynch 50%.
Some investors say 0 Friday's sell - off was a good thing, because it deflated a lot of crazy takeover speculation.
"It was a healthy cleansing," says *T*-2 Michael Holland, who *T*-1 runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York.
From here out, these investors see a return to old - fashioned investing, based * on a company's ability *PRO* to show profit growth.
"The fundamentals are pretty strong," Mr. Dreman says *T*-1.
"I don't see this as a bear market at all.
It's a recognition that there was much too much fluff in the LBO market."
Friday's big fall was "just a blunder by the stock market," says 0 *T*-1 John Connolly, chief strategist for Dean Witter.
"It was an overreaction to an event {the failure *ICH*-2 of a management and union group *PRO* to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL} that *T*-1 doesn't mean that much to lots of stocks."
Many investors have nagging worries, however.
Newspapers are full of headlines about companies defaulting on their debts and banks writing off real estate loans.
That hurts investors' confidence in the economy and stocks.
Not even all the brokerage firms see clear sailing ahead.
"Disappointing profits are likely *-1 to get worse in the next two quarters," says *T*-2 Mary Farrell, a market strategist at PaineWebber.
She thinks 0 the market could drop about 10% in the next few months, then recover and go higher.
Companies with steady earnings growth could do well, she says 0 *?*, while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10%.
Selwyn B. Kossuth was named *-1 *PRO*-2 executive director of the commission, *PRO* effective early November.
Mr. Kossuth, 52 years old, succeeds Ermanno Pascutto, 36, who *T*-1 resigned *PRO*-2 to join Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.
Mr. Kossuth was vice president and director, corporate finance, of Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., a Toronto investment dealer.
MLX Corp. said 0 it reached a preliminary agreement *ICH*-1 with senior lenders to its refrigeration and air - conditioning group *PRO* to restructure the $188.5 million *U* of credit facilities 0 the lenders provide *T*-2 to the group.
MLX, which also *T*-4 makes aircraft and heavy - duty truck parts, said 0 the debt was accumulated *-1 during its acquisition of nine businesses that *T*-3 make up the group, the biggest portion of which was related *-2 to the 1986 purchase of a Hillman Co. unit.
Among other things, the restructured facilities will substantially reduce the group's required amortization of the term loan portion of the credit facilities through September 1992, MLX said 0 *T*-1.
Certain details of the restructured facilities remain *PRO*-2 to be negotiated *-1.
The agreement is subject to completion of a definitive amendment and appropriate approvals.
William P. Panny, MLX chairman and chief executive, said 0 the pact "will provide MLX with the additional time and flexibility necessary *PRO* to complete the restructuring of the company's capital structure."
MLX has filed a registration statement *ICH*-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission covering a proposed offering of $120 million *U* in long - term senior subordinated notes and warrants.
CHICAGO - Options traders *ICH*-1 were among the big victims of Friday's plunging stock market, including one small firm that *T*-3 required an emergency $50 million *U* bailout.
While Monday's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses, many options customers and professional traders in stock - index options and the options on takeover stocks were left *-1 with multimillion - dollar losses, traders here and in New York said 0 *T*-2.
Options traders were hurt *-1 worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options, which often *T*-3 rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based *-2 *T*-4.
Thus, options traders Friday were stuck *-1 with losses that also *T*-2 were several times larger than those suffered * by many stock traders in New York.
Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market, it *EXP*-2 is "very easy for these guys to get wiped out *-1.
That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures."
An options contract gives the holder the right *PRO* to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific amount of stock, or in this case the value of a stock index, based * on a predetermined price within a given time period.
Options traders who *T*-2, in return for a small fee, or premium, had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday *-1 *PRO*-4 to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices, which *T*-3 were substantially above those in the market as it was falling.
They then had no choice *ICH*-2 in many cases but *PRO*-1 to sell the contracts at prevailing prices--in most cases at a substantial loss.
The latest round of losses is likely *-2 to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which *T*-1 has never fully recovered from the aftershock of Black Monday, when investors fled the market because of huge losses *T*-3.
Making matters worse was *T*-1 the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock - index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's halt in stock - index futures.
But while the Merc reopened a half hour later, the CBOE remained closed, *PRO* leaving many options traders *PRO*-3 unable *PRO*-2 to make trades that *T*-1 might have reduced the losses.
CBOE Chairman Alger "Duke" Chapman, said that, unlike the futures market, the options exchange has *-2 to open in a rotation that *T*-1 allows each different options series to trade.
Exchange officials reasoned that they wouldn't have been able *PRO*-1 to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon, and with the stock - index futures on the verge of *PRO* closing for a second and final time, the CBOE reasoned that its best course was *PRO*-2 to remain closed.
The damage was so bad *ICH*-3 at Fossett Corp., an options trading firm here, that it was forced *-1 *PRO*-4 to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., as a result of options trading losses.
Fosset so far is the only member of a financial exchange 0 *T*-3 to be forced *-2 *PRO*-4 to be taken *-1 over by another firm as a result of Friday's rout.
Fossett still had several million dollars in capital *ICH*-2 left * after Friday's close of trading, but not enough that regulators, worried * about another potential market plunge yesterday, would let it reopen for trading, options exchange officials said 0 *T*-1.
Thus, in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer, the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp., as well as the firm's owner, Stephen Fossett, put up a total of $50 million *U* *PRO*-1 to guarantee the customer positions being transferred * to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday.
S. Waite Rawls III, vice chairman of Continental Bank, First Options' parent company, said 0 the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held * by Fossett, almost all of them belonging to professional floor traders.
"Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money," Mr. Rawls said *T*-1.
"A package of credit support *ICH*-2 was put *-1 together--including the assets of Steve and his firm."
The bailout was cobbled *-1 together over the weekend, with officials from the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission, Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges.
"It *EXP*-3 was great *PRO* to have the luxury of time," Mr. Rawls said *T*-1.
At one point, an options industry official had *-1 to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's night watchman into *PRO* giving him the home phone number of Silas Keene, Chicago Fed president.
First Options didn't have *-1 to put any money into the bailout.
Yesterday's rally in the stock, futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials *PRO*-3 to conclude that the $50 million *U* in guarantees almost certainly won't need *-2 to be tapped *-1 by First Options.
The Fossett firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well, Mr. Rawls said 0 *T*-1.
A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend *PRO*-2 to fashion the Fossett bailout, but that conditions weren't dictated *-1 by those agencies.
"It was their business decision," the official said *T*-1.
Officials at Options Clearing Corp., which *T*-1 processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges, said that the $50 million *U* guarantee was unprecedented, but was necessary *PRO* to help *PRO*-2 insure the integrity of the options markets.
"It was an extraordinary situation that *T*-1 needed extraordinary steps," said *T*-2 Paul Stevens, OCC president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Stevens declined *PRO*-1 to give the specific contributions to the $50 million *U* guarantee from each participant.
But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $20 million *U* to the guarantee, the CBOE put up $8 million *U*, the Amex added $4 million *U* and $18 million *U* came from Mr. Fossett's own assets.
Mr. Fossett couldn't be reached *-1 *PRO*-2 to comment.
NATIONAL INCOME REALTY TRUST said 0 it will resume dividend payments with a 12 - cent - a - share dividend 0 *T*-2 to be paid *-1 Nov. 6 to shares of record Oct. 25.
The mortgage and equity real estate investment trust last paid a dividend on Aug. 1, 1988, when holders received 75 cents a share *T*-1.
Despite continuing troubles with problem properties and nonperforming loans, the Dallas trust said 0 it has rebuilt reserves, abandoned properties with little potential and experienced improved operating results from joint ventures.
Annualized interest rates on certain investments as *PRO* reported *-1 by the Federal Reserve Board on a weekly - average basis: 1989 and Wednesday October 4, 1989.
c - Yields, adjusted * for constant maturity.
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts' estimates.
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts, and had a minimum five - cent change in actual earnings per share.
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1.
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30 - day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1.
Otherwise, actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300 - day estimate.
Amcore Financial Inc. said 0 it agreed *PRO*-1 to acquire Central of Illinois Inc. in a stock swap.
Shareholders of Central, a bank holding company based * in Sterling, Ill., will receive Amcore stock equal to 10 times Central's 1989 earnings, Amcore said 0 *T*-1.
For the first nine months of 1989, Central earned $2 million *U*.
Amcore, also a bank holding company, has assets of $1.06 billion *U*.
Central's assets are $240 million *U*.
Dow Jones & Co. said 0 it acquired a 15% interest in DataTimes Corp., a subsidiary of Oklahoma Publishing Co., Oklahoma City, that *T*-1 provides electronic research services.
Terms weren't disclosed *-1.
Customers of either DataTimes or Dow Jones News / Retrieval are able *PRO*-1 to access the information on both services.
Dow Jones is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal.
Sony Corp. won a pretrial order blocking U.S. sales of Justin Products Inc.'s "My Own" line of portable audio players for children.
Judge John E. Sprizzo issued the order in Manhattan federal court, where Sony has accused the tiny company of *PRO* illegally knocking off the "My First Sony" line *T*-1.
The judge held that the combination of colors used * for the Sony products is distinctive and subject to protection under New York state law, rather than federal law.
The legal fight was the subject of a Wall Street Journal story yesterday.
Justin's attorney, Charles E. Baxley, said 0 Justin would ask an appeals court *PRO*-1 to set aside the order temporarily, pending an expedited appeal.
He also repeated Justin's denial of Sony's charges.
"Their likelihood of *PRO* reversing us is very slim," said *T*-2 Lewis H. Eslinger, Sony's attorney, who *T*-1 said 0 he doubts 0 Justin will go ahead with a trial.
General Dynamics Services Co., a unit of General Dynamics Corp., won a $48.2 million *U* Army contract *PRO* to establish maintenance facilities for tracked vehicles in Pakistan.
Grumman Corp. was given *-1 a $15 million *U* Navy contract for aircraft - electronics improvements.
Hughes Aircraft Co., a unit of General Motors Corp., got a $10.3 million *U* Air Force contract for airborne - radar equipment.
Amcast Industrial Corp. said 0 it plans *PRO*-1 to repurchase 500,000 shares, or about 7% of its shares outstanding, in open market transactions.
The metal products concern currently has 7.2 million common shares outstanding.
Amcast previously had said 0 it planned *PRO*-1 to repurchase shares, but didn't disclose when or how many shares it intended *PRO*-2 to buy *T*-3 back.
The company named Dillon Read & Co. as its exclusive agent for the stock buy - back program.
Houston attorney Dale Friend, representing a plaintiff in a damage suit, says 0 he has negotiated a settlement that *T*-1 will strike a blow for his client.
Literally.
It turns out 0 Mr. Friend's client, Machelle Parks of Cincinnati, didn't like the way 0 defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings *T*-1.
So she has agreed *PRO*-1 to forgo monetary damages against Mr. Alexander's client in return for the right *PRO* to punch the attorney.
Ms. Parks's mother also gets *PRO*-1 to cuff Mr. Alexander.
So does *T*-1 Mr. Friend and his law partner, Nick Nichols.
The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander's representation of Derr Construction Co., one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought * by Ms. Parks, the widow of a construction worker killed * in January 1987 while *PRO* working on a new Houston convention center.
Last month, Mr. Friend says 0 *?*, Mr. Alexander's associate agreed that Derr would pay $50,000 *U* as part of an overall settlement.
But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute, *PRO*-1 angering the plaintiff's side.
"I never agreed to it," Mr. Alexander says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 adding that "it *EXP*-1's not necessary *PRO* to pay these nuisance settlements."
When Ms. Parks and her mother heard about what *T*-1 had happened *T*-2, Mr. Friend says 0 *?*, they volunteered that they would like *PRO*-4 to give Mr. Alexander a good walloping.
Mr. Friend says 0 he passed that along to his adversary, and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which Derr could keep its money *T*-1 and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander *T*-1.
Although time and place have yet *-2 to be determined *-1, some details are in place.
Mr. Friend says 0 he agreed *PRO*-1 to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt.
Ms. Parks and her mother indicated 0 they want *PRO*-1 to "catch him unawares from behind," he says 0 *T*-2.
Mr. Alexander, for his part, insisted that the punchers can't assign their pummeling rights to anyone else, can't use a blunt instrument and can't take a running start.
Mr. Alexander says 0 he regards the agreement, which *T*-2 hasn't been submitted *-1 to a judge, as something of a joke.
However, he acknowledges 0 they "have the option of *PRO* taking a swat at me if they really want to *?*."
Mr. Friend says 0 his side is "dead serious."
Although they don't contemplate *PRO*-1 delivering any disabling blows, he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to sign a release from liability, just in case.
David D. Lung was appointed *-1 *PRO*-2 president and chief operating officer of this maker of building materials for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
As president, Mr. Lung, 42 years old, succeeds his father, Mervin D. Lung, 66, who *T*-1 founded the company in 1959.
Mervin Lung remains chairman and chief executive officer.
David Lung has been with Patrick since 1970, and has served as vice president for administration and purchasing since 1987.
Stanislav Ovcharenko, who *T*-1 represents the Soviet airline Aeroflot here, has some visions that *T*-2 are wild even by the current standards of perestroika.
In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport, Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 "just ideas":
First, he suggests 0 *?*, GPA Group Ltd., the international aircraft leasing company based * in Ireland, could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline.
Then Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, could teach Aeroflot pilots *PRO*-2 to fly the Boeings, and the fleet could be based *-1 here at Shannon Airport.
That's not all, he says 0 *T*-1.
Aer Rianta, the Irish airport authority, could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union.
Aeroflot could lease some of its cargo planes to Aer Lingus, through GPA, for a joint - venture cargo airline.
And then there is his notion of an Irish - Soviet charter airline 0 *T*-1 to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon.
Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. Ovcharenko's head?
Hardly.
The Irish - Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport.
GPA is indeed talking about *PRO* leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about *PRO* buying Soviet - built Tupolev 204s.
Aer Lingus is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities.
Aer Rianta already has so many ventures with Aeroflot that its chief executive is studying Russian.
*PRO* Unlikely as it may seem *-1 *?*, tiny, politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy.
And as Aeroflot struggles *PRO*-1 to boost its service standards, upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities, the Irish aviation industry seems poised *PRO*-2 to benefit.
"Irish and Soviet people are similar," says *T*-1 Mr. Ovcharenko.
"They look the same.
They're very friendly."
Moreover, he says 0 *?*, Irish companies are small but spunky.
"We have *-1 to study their experience very well," he says *T*-2.
"We must find any way 0 *PRO* to get business *T*-1."
The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s, long before Soviet joint ventures were the rage in the West.
Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, the airline's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through.
An apartment complex down the road is the crew - rest and staging area for more than 130 Aeroflot pilots and flight attendants.
The airport's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union.
Tankers from the Latvian port of Ventspils each year unload 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport.
What Aeroflot doesn't pour *T*-3 into its own gas - guzzling Ilyushins is bartered *-1 to the airport authority, which *T*-2 resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France, Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines.
Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees, ground - handling and catering bills with fuel, *PRO*-1 preserving its hard currency.
That isn't all.
Last year, the Irish airport authority, in a joint venture with Aeroflot, opened four hard - currency duty - free shops at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport.
Aer Rianta now manages duty - free sales on all Aeroflot international flights out of Moscow.
Duty - free shops in Leningrad's Pulkova Airport opened in July, and hard - currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet - Finnish frontier are coming soon.
Aer Rianta is talking about similar joint ventures in Tashkent and in Sochi, a Black Sea resort, and even has a computer - assembly project cooking with the Georgian city of Tbilisi.
Aeroflot's international fleet of 285 planes is being repainted and refurbished *-1 at Shannon Airport.
*PRO* Thanks to a new air - traffic agreement and the ability *ICH*-1 of Irish travel agents *PRO* to issue Aeroflot tickets, tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot's reasonable prices *PRO*-2 to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana, Kingston and Mexico City.
The round - trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts ($578 *U*).
Jamaica costs 504 punts.
A formal blessing of sorts was bestowed *-1 on this friendship in April when Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey *T*-2.
New trade accords were signed *-1.
It all started with geography.
When it opened in 1939 *T*-1, Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America.
Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets, but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that *T*-1 can't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop.
As a result, Ireland didn't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983, though it suspended direct Moscow - Shannon flights for two months.
In fact, Aer Lingus started *-1 ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights *T*-2.
Today, Aer Rianta is making a heap of money from its Soviet friendship.
And, with those contacts in place, it *EXP*-1 could be relatively simple *PRO* to add Aer Lingus and GPA to the team.
Then, perhaps, Mr. Ovcharenko's ideas wouldn't sound like so much blarney.
Consumers may want *PRO*-1 to move their telephones a little closer to the TV set.
Couch - potato jocks watching ABC's "Monday Night Football" can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays.
Two weeks ago, viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started *-1 calling a 900 number for advice on various life - style issues.
And the new syndicated "reality" show "Hard Copy" records viewers' opinions for possible airing on the next day's show.
Interactive telephone technology has taken a new leap in sophistication, and television programmers are racing *PRO*-1 to exploit the possibilities.
Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology and resent the cost.
But right now programmers are figuring that viewers who *T*-1 are busy *PRO*-2 dialing up a range of services may put down their remote control zappers and stay tuned.
"We've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles *PRO*-2 talking to TV production people," says *T*-3 Mike Parks, president of Call Interactive, which *T*-1 supplied technology for both ABC Sports and NBC's consumer minutes.
"With the competitiveness of the television market these days, everyone is looking for a way 0 *PRO* to get viewers more excited *T*-1."
One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive, a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
*PRO*-1 Formed *-2 in August, the venture weds AT&T's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice - activated computers in American Express's Omaha, Neb., service center.
Other long - distance carriers have also begun *-1 marketing enhanced 900 service, and special consultants are springing up *PRO*-2 to exploit the new tool.
Blair Entertainment, a New York firm that *T*-1 advises TV stations and sells ads for them, has just formed a subsidiary--900 Blair--0 *T*-2 to apply the technology to television.
The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years.
For a while, high - cost pornography lines and services that *T*-2 tempt children to dial (and redial) movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image, but new legal restrictions are aimed *-1 at *PRO* trimming excesses.
The cost of a 900 call is set *-1 by the originator--ABC Sports, for example--with the cheapest starting at 75 cents.
Billing is included *-1 in a caller's regular phone bill.
From the fee, the local phone company and the long - distance carrier extract their costs 0 *PRO* to carry the call *T*-2, *PRO*-3 passing the rest of the money to the originator, which *T*-1 must cover advertising and other costs.
In recent months, the technology has become more flexible and able *PRO*-1 to handle much more volume.
Before, callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk, or they'd vote "yes" or "no" by *PRO* calling one of two numbers.
(People in the phone business call this technology "*PRO*-1 900 click.")
Now, callers are led *-1 through complex menus of choices *PRO*-1 to retrieve information 0 they want *T*-2, and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds.
Up to now, 900 numbers have mainly been used *-1 on local TV stations and cable channels.
MTV used one *PRO*-1 to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in *T*-2.
For several years, Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network has invited viewers *PRO*-1 to respond nightly to topical issues ("Should the U.S. military intervene in Panama?"), but even the hottest controversies on CNN log only about 10,000 calls.
The newest uses of the 900 - interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications.
Capital Cities / ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected *-1 to announce soon a joint campaign 0 *T*-2 to raise awareness about hunger.
The subject will be written *-1 into the plots of prime - time shows, and viewers will be given *-2 a 900 number 0 *PRO* to call *T*-3.
Callers will be sent *-1 educational booklets, and the call's modest cost will be an immediate method of *PRO* raising money.
Other network applications have very different goals.
ABC Sports was looking for ways 0 *PRO* to lift deflated halftime ratings for "Monday Night Football *T*-1."
Kurt Sanger, ABC Sports's marketing director, says that now "tens of thousands" of fans call its 900 number each week *PRO*-1 to vote for the best punt return, quarterback sack, etc.
Profit from the calls goes to charity, but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool: After *PRO* thanking callers for voting, Frank Gifford offers a football videotape for $19.95 *U*, and 5% of callers stay on the line *PRO*-1 to order it.
Jackets may be sold *-1 next.
Meanwhile, NBC Sports recently began "Scores Plus," a year - round, 24 - hour 900 line providing a complex array of scores, analysis and fan news.
A spokesman said 0 its purpose is "*PRO* to bolster the impression that NBC Sports is always there for people."
NBC's "On - Line" consumer minutes have increased advertiser spending during the day, the network's weakest period.
Each weekday matches a sponsor and a topic: On Mondays, Unilever N.V.'s Lever Bros. sponsors tips on diet and exercise, followed * by a 30 - second Lever Bros. commercial.
Viewers can call a 900 number for additional advice, which *T*-2 will be tailored *-1 to their needs based on the numbers 0 they punch *T*-3 ("*PRO* Press one if you're pregnant," etc .).
If the caller stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor, coupons and a newsletter will be mailed *-1, and the sponsor will be able *PRO*-2 to gather a list of desirable potential customers.
Diane Seaman, an NBC - TV vice president, says 0 NBC has been able *PRO*-1 to charge premium rates for this ad time.
She wouldn't say what the premium is *T*-1, but it's believed *-2 to be about 40% above regular daytime rates.
"We were able *PRO*-1 to get advertisers to use their promotion budget for this, because they get a chance 0 *PRO* to do couponing *T*-2," says *T*-3 Ms. Seaman.
"And we were able *PRO*-1 to attract some new advertisers because this is something new."
Mr. Parks of Call Interactive says 0 TV executives are considering the use of 900 numbers for "talk shows, game shows, news and opinion surveys."
Experts are predicting a big influx of new shows in 1990, when a service called *PRO* *PRO*-2 "automatic number information" will become widely available *T*-1.
This service identifies each caller's phone number, and it can be used *-1 *PRO* to generate instant mailing lists.
"Hard Copy," the new syndicated tabloid show from Paramount Pictures, will use its 900 number for additional purposes that *T*-1 include research, says 0 *T*-2 executive producer Mark B. von S. Monsky.
"For a piece on local heroes of World War II, we can ask people *PRO*-2 to leave the name and number of anyone 0 they know *T*-3 who *T*-1 won a medal," he says *T*-4.
"That'll save us time and get people involved."
But Mr. Monsky sees much bigger changes ahead.
"These are just baby steps toward real interactive video, which I believe 0 *T*-1 will be the biggest thing yet 0 *T*-2 to affect television," he says *T*-3.
Although it *EXP*-1 would be costly *PRO* to shoot multiple versions, TV programmers could let audiences vote on different endings for a movie.
Fox Broadcasting experimented with this concept last year when viewers of "Married...With Children" voted on whether Al should say "I love you" to Peg on Valentine's Day *T*-1.
Someday, viewers may also choose different depths of news coverage.
"A menu by phone could let you decide, ` I'm interested in just the beginning of story No. 1, and I want story No. 2 in depth," Mr. Monsky says *T*-1.
"You'll start *-1 to see shows where viewers program the program *T*-2.
CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT Corp. said 0 its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable Nov. 6 to stock of record Oct. 16.
The dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share, of which half *T*-2 was paid *-1 July 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with B.B. Real Estate Investment Corp., also in July.
The company said 0 it hopes *PRO*-1 to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year.
Raw - steel production by the nation's mills decreased 0.8% last week to 1,828,000 tons from 1,843,000 tons the previous week, the American Iron and Steel Institute said 0 *T*-1.
Last week's output rose 1.4% from the 1,802,000 tons produced * a year earlier.
The industry used 82.2% of its capability last week, compared with 82.8% the previous week and 84% a year ago.
The capability utilization rate is a calculation designed * *PRO*-1 to indicate at what percent of its production capability the industry is operating *T*-2 in a given week.
Hydro - Quebec said 0 it notified Central Maine Power Co. 0 it will cancel a $4 billion *U* contract *PRO* to supply electricity to the Maine utility.
The provincially owned utility said 0 it is tearing up the deal because "the contract's objectives can't be fulfilled *-1."
Hydro - Quebec said 0 Maine regulators' refusal *PRO* to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for resale of electricity carried * through Maine to other utilities.
"It would now be physically impossible *PRO* to begin deliveries in 1992," a Hydro - Quebec official said *T*-1.
The contract was *-1 to run from 1992 to 2020.
Under the contract Hydro - Quebec was *-1 to supply 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine Power *PRO* starting in 1992, 600 megawatts *PRO* starting in 1995 and 900 megawatts *PRO* starting in
Hydro - Quebec said 0 Maine regulators' refusal *PRO* to approve the contract means 0 Central Maine Power has lost its place in line.
"We won't sign any new contracts {with deliveries} beginning earlier than 2000," the Hydro - Quebec official said *T*-1.
He said 0 Hydro - Quebec already has some "customers *ICH*-2 in mind" for the power that *T*-3 was *-4 to be delivered *-1 to Maine.
"Nothing *ICH*-1 has happened since we signed the contract *PRO* to undermine our conviction that Hydro - Quebec was the lowest - cost, most environmentally acceptable choice for *PRO* meeting a part of our customers' energy needs through the year 2020," said *T*-2 Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly.
Central Maine said 0 it is evaluating "many energy options" 0 *PRO* to make up for the lost future power *T*-1, including new energy generation and management proposals from New England, and possibly new Canadian purchases.
When Nucor Corp. begins *-1 shipping steel from the world's first thin - slab plant this month *T*-2, it will begin *-3 testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors.
The new technology, which *T*-1 creates a very thin piece of steel, radically reduces the costs of *PRO* making flat - rolled sheets.
An ebullient Kenneth Iverson, Nucor's chairman, says 0 the company's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours, compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill.
"We've had the Russians and Chinese, and people from India visiting us," Mr. Iverson beams *T*-1.
"Everyone in the world is watching us very closely."
Especially his neighbors, the major U.S. steelmakers.
Already, USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor's technology *PRO*-1 to see if they can adopt it.
Says *ICH*-1 the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company: "It's damn worrisome."
The once - staid steel industry is about *-2 to be turned *-1 *PRO*-3 topsy - turvy by a 1990s technology revolution.
New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it *EXP*-2 easier for smaller, less cash - rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid *T*-1 decades ago.
It also enables minimills *PRO*-1 finally to get a toehold in the flat - rolled steel market--the major steelmakers' largest, most prized, and until now, untouchable, market.
But such thin - slab technology is only the beginning.
Eager engineers espouse direct - steelmaking and direct casting, which by the end of the 1990s *T*-1 will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces.
Those massive structures, while *PRO*-1 posing cost and environmental headaches, effectively locked out all but deep - pocketed giants from steelmaking.
"There's a revolution ahead of us that *T*-1 will ultimately change the way 0 we market and distribute steel *T*-2," says *T*-3 William Dennis, vice president, manufacturing and technology, for the American Iron Ore and Steel Institute.
It isn't that major steelmakers have blithely ignored high technology.
In fact, they've spent billions of dollars *PRO*-1 to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9% in 1988, from 39.6% five years before.
Moreover, their balance sheets are rich with diversity, their old plants shuttered, and work forces lean.
But that won't suffice.
"It *EXP*-1's no longer enough *PRO* to beat the guy down the street.
You have *-1 to beat everyone around the world," says *T*-2 Mr. Dennis.
He wants *PRO*-1 to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence.
The problem: They're saddled *-2 with huge plants that *T*-1 require costly maintenance.
And *PRO* try plying new dollars *PRO*-2 free in a market that *T*-1 is softening, hurt * by a strong dollar and concerned about overcapacity--the industry's Darth Vadar.
"The technology revolution is going *-1 to be very threatening to established producers," says *T*-2 Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
"They've got too much invested * in the old stuff and they can't get their workers to be flexible."
No one expects minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers, who *T*-1 remain the undisputed kings of highest - quality steel used * for autos and refrigerators.
Nucor's plant in Crawfordsville, Ind., ultimately will produce only one million tons *ICH*-2 annually, a drop in the 40 - million - ton - a - year flat - rolled steel bucket, and it will be years before such plants can compete in the high - profit market.
Still, flat - rolled is the steel industry's bread and butter, *PRO*-2 representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected *PRO* to be shipped *-1 this year.
Moreover, the process isn't without its headaches.
Because all operations are connected *-1, one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown.
On some days, the Nucor plant doesn't produce anything.
"At this point, the minimill capacity won't make a great dent in the integrated market, but it does challenge them *PRO*-1 to develop new markets," says *T*-2 James McCall, vice president, materials, at Battelle, a technology and management - research giant based * in Columbus, Ohio.
Indeed, with demand for steel not growing fast enough *PRO* to absorb capacity, steelmakers will have *-1 to change the way 0 they do business *T*-2.
In the past, says 0 *?* Armco's chief economist John Corey, steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock.
"We said: ` We've got a product: if you want it, you can buy it,"' he says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 adding: "Now we're figuring out what people need *T*-1, and are going back *PRO*-4 to make it."
Armco's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp.'s Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., two or three days a week.
When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly *T*-2, Armco convinced a steel service center *PRO*-3 to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered *-1 within 15 minutes.
*PRO* Cementing such relationships with major clients--car and appliance makers--is a means of survival, especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers *T*-1 and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers *T*-1.
For example, when Detroit began *-2 talking about plastic - bodied cars *T*-3, the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort *PRO*-4 to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by *PRO* simply redesigning how a car door is assembled *-1 *T*-5 *T*-6.
But steelmakers must also find new markets.
After *PRO* letting aluminum - makers take the recycling lead, a group of the nation's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute *PRO*-2 to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation.
Battelle's Mr. McCall thinks 0 steelmakers should concentrate more on construction.
Weirton Steel Corp., Weirton, W. Va., for example, is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors, with leaded glass inserts, as a secure and energy - efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones.
Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia.
Still others are looking at overseas markets.
USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel - hungry Soviet Union.
This year, the nation's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation.
Producers also are trying *PRO*-2 to differentiate by *PRO* concentrating on higher - profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized products, which *T*-1 remain beyond the reach of minimills.
Almost all capital - improvement programs announced * by major steelmakers within the past year involve *PRO*-1 building electrogalvanizing lines, used * *PRO* to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors.
But unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread - and - butter flat - rolled steel.
"It's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat," says *T*-1 John Jacobson, an analyst with AUS Consultants.
"After a while, someone has *-1 to go over the side."
Although he doesn't expect any bankruptcies, he does see more plants being sold or closed *-1.
Robert Crandall, with the Brookings Institute, agrees.
"Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently *PRO* to offset the growth of minimills."
Not to mention the incursion of imports.
Japanese and European steelmakers, which *T*-1 have led the recent technology developments, are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992.
Moreover, the U.S. can expect more competition from low - cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries.
A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans *PRO*-1 to build a Nucor - like plant.
"People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business," says *T*-1 Mr. Iverson.
"They're dead wrong."

AN EARTHQUAKE STRUCK Northern California, *PRO*-1 killing more than 50 people.
The violent temblor, which *T*-1 lasted about 15 seconds and registered 6.9 on the Richter scale, also caused the collapse of a 30 - foot section of the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge and shook Candlestick Park.
The tremor was centered near Hollister, southeast of San Francisco, and was felt *-1 as far as 200 miles away.
Numerous injuries were reported *-1.
Some buildings collapsed, gas and water lines ruptured and fires raged.
The quake, which also *T*-1 caused damage in San Jose and Berkeley, knocked out electricity and telephones, cracked roadways and disrupted subway service in the Bay Area.

Korean car exports have slid about 40% so far this year, but auto makers here aren't panicking.
They are enjoying domestic sales that *T*-1 are more than *PRO* making up for lost overseas sales.
South Korean consumers are expected *-1 to buy almost 500,000 passenger cars this year, up 60% from 1988.
In fact, some auto executives suggest that slackened demand for their cars in the U.S. and Canada is a blessing; otherwise they wouldn't be able *PRO*-1 to keep up with demand in the more profitable local market.
"We are very lucky *PRO*-1 to easily change an export loss to domestic plus," says *T*-2 Hong Tu Pyo, managing director of domestic marketing for Hyundai Motor Co.
As it is *?*, waiting lists of a month *ICH*-1 aren't unusual for popular models.
Demand is so strong that all of the domestic makers--Hyundai, Kia Motors Corp., Daewoo Motor Co. and even upstart SsangYong Motor Co.--plan *PRO*-1 to build more factories.
Industry analysts predict that by 1995, South Korea will be building three million cars a year--about half of that for export.
It's an optimistic move in a industry already facing world - wide overcapacity.
But South Korean auto makers are confident that the export market will bounce back and that demand in Korea will stay strong.
Currently only one in 38 South Koreans owns a car, up from one in 200 a decade ago.
"In the year 2000 it will be one car per family.
At that point domestic sales will slow down," says *T*-1 Kim Yoon Kwon, director of marketing for Daewoo Motor.
The reason for the tremendous demand is simple: South Koreans suddenly have a lot more money.
"We never thought 0 we'd own a car," says *T*-2 Kwang Ok Kyong, who *T*-1 just bought a Daewoo LeMans on a five - year loan.
She and her husband started a small printing business and need the car for work as well as for weekend jaunts.
Pay raises of 60% over the past three years have given many South Koreans the money 0 *PRO* to enjoy the things 0 they were supplying the rest of the world *T*-3 *T*-1.
The success of newcomer SsangYong Motor shows the strength of the auto market and its growing diversity.
*PRO*-1 A part of the construction - oriented conglomerate SsangYong Group, it took over the dying Dong - A Motor Co. in 1986.
SsangYong began *-1 making variations of the Jeep - like "Korando" vehicle.
(Dong - A had had a technology agreement with Jeep maker American Motors Corp., now a part of Chrysler Corp.)
The most popular style is the stretched "Family," which *T*-1 resembles a Ford Bronco or Chevy Blazer.
The four - wheel - drive vehicles start at $15,000 *U*; a Family can cost over $25,000 *U*.
SsangYong, which *T*-3 has only about 3% of the domestic market, will sell about 18,000 of its models *ICH*-2 this year, twice as many as last year.
It sees sales rising 45% to 26,000 units next year.
The company plans *PRO*-1 to expand plant capacity 50% by 1991.
By then it also hopes *PRO*-1 to begin *-2 producing a passenger car based * on the Volvo 240 and selling for about $20,000 *U*.
Hyundai and Daewoo seem *-1 unconcerned about the SsangYong threat, but Kia, the scrappy No.3 auto maker, is selling four - wheel - drive vehicles through its Asia unit.
It plans *PRO*-1 to sell 1,700 units in 1989.
Kia, the only Korean car maker that *T*-1 has seen its overseas sales grow in 1989, aims at Korea's common man.
Its advantage has been the peppy little Pride, sold * as the Ford Festiva in the U.S. .
At 3.8 million won, or $5,700 *U*, the econobox is the lowest - priced car in South Korea.
Along with two larger models, the company claims 18% of the domestic market.
Ford Motor Co. and Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. have equity interests in Kia.
Kia is the most aggressive of the Korean Big Three in *PRO* offering financing.
Loans for as long as five years make the cars very accessible, with monthly payments as low as 80,000 won, or $120 *U*.
Daewoo Motor, a 50 - 50 joint venture with General Motors Corp. and the Daewoo Group conglomerate, is the only auto maker that *T*-51 appears *-1 to be hurting.
Shipments of its Lemans to GM's Pontiac division are off about 65% from a year ago, versus a 44% decline for Hyundai and an 18% increase for Kia.
Moreover, Daewoo's domestic sales have grown half as fast as sales of its rivals.
The big problem for Daewoo, which *T*-1 holds about 21% of the market, is the long series of labor disruptions 0 it suffered *T*-2 this year.
But Daewoo is expanding too.
In fact, a sister company, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, plans *PRO*-1 to build 240,000 minicars by the mid-1990s.
Hyundai, the Korean market leader with a 58% share, also plans *PRO*-1 to jump into minicars at the same time.
It has a similar project for 200,000 cars a year.
Kia is reportedly also considering such a plan.
Even giant Samsung Group is rumored *-1 in the Korean press *-1 to be considering *PRO*-2 getting into the auto - making business; a company spokesman had no comment.
Once again, your editorial page misstates the law 0 *T*-1 to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions.
In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, Michael S. Greve informs your readers, "...the Clean Water Act is written *-1 upon the presumption--the pretense, rather--that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge" ("Congress's Environmental Buccaneers," Sept. 18).
This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive, but it is simply wrong.
The Clean Water Act contains no "legal standard" of zero discharge.
It requires that "discharges of pollutants" into the "waters of the United States" be authorized *-1 by permits that *T*-2 reflect the effluent limitations developed * under section 301.
Whatever *T*-1 may be the problems with this system, it scarcely reflects "zero risk" or "zero discharge."
Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused *-1 by Congress's meaningless statement of "the national goal" in section 101, which indeed *T*-2 calls for the elimination of discharges--by 1985, no less.
This fatuous statement was not taken *-1 seriously when *PRO* enacted *-2 in 1972 *T*-3, and should not now be confused *-1 with the operative provisions of the statute.
Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water *T*-1; your tippling readers may be led *-2 *PRO*-3 to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors.

Japanese Firms Push Posh Car Showrooms
JAPANESE luxury - car makers are trying *PRO*-1 to set strict design standards for their dealerships.
But some dealers are negotiating looser terms, while others decline *PRO*-1 to deal at all.
Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti division likes *PRO*-2 to insist that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style.
Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that *T*-1 flows into the building from outside.
"Infiniti has it down to the ashtrays," says *T*-1 Jay Ferron, a partner at J.D. Power & Associates, an auto research firm.
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division also provides specifications.
But only two - thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs.
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs.
In Louisville, Ky., for example, David Peterson has built a Lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor.
Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable *PRO*-1 to meet the design requirements.
Lee Seidman of Cleveland says 0 Infiniti "was a bear on interiors" but at least let him retrofit an existing building--without the stream.
Mr. Seidman says 0 he turned down a Lexus franchise in part because "the building was gorgeous but very expensive."
*PRO*-1 To head off arguments, Infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and low - interest construction loans.

That's the lesson offered * through one case study featured * in a design exhibit.
Dictaphone Corp. was caught *-1 off guard in 1974 when its main competitor, Lanier Office Products of Japan, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices *T*-2.
*PRO*-1 Blocked *-2 by patent protection from *PRO* following suit, Dictaphone decided *PRO*-1 to go a step further and cut the cassette in half *ICH*-3 again--down to the length of a paperclip.
By 1979, designers and engineers at Dictaphone, a Pitney Bowes subsidiary, had produced a working model of a "picocassette" recorder.
By 1982, however, the patent status of the Lanier microcassette had changed, *PRO* permitting Dictaphone *PRO*-2 to develop its own competitive micro system, which it did *T*-1.
Marketing and sales departments then urged abandonment of the pico project.
But others said 0 pico should proceed.
Both were right.
Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985, but it hasn't sold well.
To date, says 0 *?* Emil Jachmann, a Dictaphone vice president, it has "broken even or shown a small loss."
Nevertheless, the device has been successful in other ways.
It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers, and it provided new technology for other company products.
The picocassette recorder also helped *PRO*-1 transform the company's reputation from follower to leading - edge innovator.
"It *EXP*-3 gave me great pride *PRO* to see the inventor of the microcassette in Japan look at the pico and shake his head and say ` unbelievable,"' says *T*-1 Mr. Jachmann.
Dictaphone's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project, sponsored * by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School.
The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley.
A Rake's Progress Means *PRO* Branching Out
ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile, Ala., was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept *PRO*-1 riding up over the piles.
The harder he tried *PRO*-1 to push them into large piles, the closer he came to *PRO*-2 breaking the rake and straining his back.
So Mr. Barrett, then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association, took a steel - toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up.
His crude device worked: The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile, while the higher, harder teeth moved the top of the pile.
*PRO*-2 Now incorporated *-1 into a polypropylene rake, the four - inch prongs, or "wonderbars," also are supposed *-2 to aid in *PRO* picking up leaves.
One customer, Donald Blaggs of Mobile, says 0 the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours, two hours less than usual.
But other rake makers have their doubts.
Richard Mason, president of Ames Co. in Parkersburg, W. Va., says 0 the Barrett rake "makes sense," but it would be "tough" 0 *PRO* to explain *T*-1 to consumers.
John Stoner, marketing director for True Temper Corp., a subsidiary of Black & Decker, says 0 people don't want *PRO*-1 to move a leaf pile.
"They either pick it up," he says *?*, "or they start *-2 pulling from a fresh direction."
Odds and Ends
NO MORE STUBBED toes or bruised shins, promises *T*-1 Geste Corp. of Goshen, Ind., the designer of a bed support 0 *T*-2 to replace traditional frames.
Four tubular steel "Bedfellows," each roughly in the shape of a "W," are attached *-1 to the bottom of the box spring in a recessed position....
Nearly half of U.S. consumers say 0 they'll pay up to 5% more for packaging that *T*-1 can be recycled *-2 or is biodegradable, according to a survey commissioned * by the Michael Peters Group, a design consultant.
A federal appeals court struck down a natural - gas regulation that *T*-1 had prevented pipeline companies from *PRO* passing to customers part of $1 billion *U* in costs from controversial "*PRO* take - or - pay" contracts.
The court, in a 3 - 0 ruling, threw out a deadline set * by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for *PRO* settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved *T*-1 but didn't use *T*-1.
FERC's regulation had given pipelines until March 31, 1989, *PRO*-3 to pass on to customers as much as 50% of the costs of *PRO* buying out their broken contracts, which *T*-2 were made *-1 with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short *T*-6.
A majority of old contracts were renegotiated *-1 by the deadline and settled *-1 at steep discounts.
But pipeline companies estimate 0 they still face $2.4 billion *U* in liabilities from unresolved disputes, including $1 billion *U* 0 they fear 0 they won't be able *PRO*-1 to pass on to customers.
According to industry lawyers, the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance *PRO* to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost - sharing mechanism.
The court left open whether FERC could reimpose a new deadline later.
The court, agreeing with pipeline companies, found 0 the March 31 deadline was "arbitrary and capricious" and "highly prejudicial to the bargaining power of pipelines" that *T*-1 were forced *-2 *PRO*-4 to negotiate settlement of the old *PRO* take - or - pay contracts *PRO*-3 to meet the deadline.
A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar, from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988.
The court ordered FERC *PRO*-1 to justify within 60 days not only its cost - sharing deadline, but other major elements of its proposed regulation for *PRO* introducing more competition into natural - gas transportation.
The court also questioned a crediting mechanism that *T*-1 could be used *-2 *PRO* to resolve *PRO* take - or - pay liabilities.
The complex regulation, known * in the industry as Order 500, has been hotly contested *-1 by all sides, including natural - gas producers, pipelines, local distribution companies and consumers.
The court's decision would allow FERC to change some of its provisions, but ensures 0 it will be reviewed *-1 again quickly by the court.
In what *T*-1 is believed *-2 to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 killings in Beijing, an international bank syndicate has terminated a $55 million *U* credit for a Shanghai property project.
The syndicate, led * by Schroders Asia Ltd., agreed last November *PRO*-1 to provide the loan to Asia Development Corp., a U.S. property developer.
But several weeks ago, in the wake of the Beijing killings, the loan was canceled *-1, according to bankers and executives close to the project.
Asia Development and Schroders declined *PRO*-1 to comment on the move.
Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4, but the harsh crackdown, which *T*-1 caused many businesses to reassess their China transactions, "gave the banks the out 0 they wanted *T*-2," says 0 *T*-3 an official close to the Shanghai venture.
The decision *PRO* to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude 0 bankers have taken *T*-1 toward China since June 4.
While some commercial lending has resumed, international lenders remain nervous about China's economic troubles and foreign debt--$40 billion *U* at the end of 1988.
Many loans *ICH*-2 are being renegotiated *-3, especially those tied * to the hotel sector, which *T*-5 has been hit *-4 hard by a post-June 4 tourism slump.
Many bankers view property - sector loans as particularly risky.
The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development, a small concern, saddled * with a half - completed 32 - story apartment building and heavy debts.
The company owes $11 million *U* to the Shui On Group, the project's Hong Kong contractor, and a significant, though unspecified, amount in legal fees to Coudert Brothers, a U.S. law firm, the sources say 0 *T*-3.
The project, known * as Lotus Mansion, has been mired *-1 in controversy.
When the loan agreement was announced *-1 *T*-3, it was hailed *-2 as one of the first Western - style financing transactions ever used * in China.
Unlike most loans to China, there was no Chinese guarantor.
Instead, the banks secured a promise *ICH*-1 from state - owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $55 million *U* at maturity *PRO*-2 to finance repayment of the original borrowing.
The loan was *-2 to have matured in just two to three years, as soon as construction was completed *-1.
But in a letter sent * in August to Asia Development, Schroders said 0 the loan was terminated *-1 because the developer had failed *-2 to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the loan - management committee on time, according to officials close to the project.
Creditors involved in the project contend, however, that the termination actually had nothing 0 *T*-1 to do with these technical violations.
Instead, the creditors say 0 *?*, the loan fell victim to nervousness about China's political turmoil, as well as to concern about the loan's security.
The bank syndicate is made *-1 up mostly of European banks, but it includes China's state - owned Citic Industrial Bank.
The 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn *-1 down.

SOFT CONTACT LENSES WON federal blessing on March 18, 1971, and quickly became eye openers for their makers.
The Food and Drug Administration that day said 0 Bausch & Lomb could start *-1 selling them in the U.S. .
The cornflake - size product was more comfortable and less prone to *PRO* falling out than hard contact lenses, which *T*-1 had been around since 1939.
Bausch & Lomb sold the softies under a sublicense from National Patent Development, which *T*-1 had gained the rights from the Czechoslovakia Academy of Sciences.
Otto Wichterle, a Czech, invented them in 1962.
The plastic lens wraps itself over the cornea, *PRO*-1 absorbing eye moisture while *PRO*-2 permitting oxygen *PRO*-3 to pass through.
But the new lens became the eye of a storm.
In September 1971 California officials seized "bootlegged" lenses--made * by unlicensed companies--after some showed traces of bacteria.
In October doctors were debating the product's safety, some claiming 0 it caused infections.
And there were Senate hearings on the questions in July 1972.
The product overcame the bad publicity and kept *PRO*-1 evolving.
The early soft lenses, which *T*-1 cost $300 *U* a set, were expected *-2 to last for a year.
In 1983 "extended wear" versions, designed *PRO* to be worn *-1 for 30 days at a time, wree offered *-2.
Eighteen months ago a "disposable" seven - day model bowed; a year's supply costs about $500 *U*.
Last month the FDA and Contact Lens Institute cautioned users that serious eye infections could result from *PRO* wearing lenses more than seven days at a stretch.
Today 20 million of the 25 million Americans using contact lenses are using the soft type.
Including the accesory eye care products, contacts account for $2 billion *U* in annual retail sales.
Although Bausch remains the leader among the six majors, Johnson & Johnson, with its new disposables, is coming on fast.
This Los Angeles company and its Union Federal Savings Bank subsidiary said 0 more than 99% of their 7 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2011 were tendered *-1 for conversion into UnionFed common stock.
The conversion increased total equity capital by about $38.5 million *U* to a total of $156.8 million *U*.
Union Federal, a federally insured savings bank, has $2.4 billion *U* in assets.
The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting *PRO* to lead leveraged buy - outs of their specialty and department - store chains, investment bankers and retailers said 0 *T*-1.
Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend *PRO*-1 to bid for their companies.
The chains include Bloomingdale's, owned * by Campeau Corp., Toronto; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's, owned * by B.A.T Industries PLC, London; and B. Altman & Co. and Sakowitz Inc., owned * by Hooker Corp., which *T*-2 is now being managed *-1 by a court - appointed provisional liquidator.
Hooker is based *-1 in Sydney, Australia.
The combination of so many chains available for sale, the recent failures of such retailing LBO's as Miller & Rhoads Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices, retailing observers said 0 *T*-1.
"The pricing will become more realistic, which *T*-1 should help management," said *T*-2 Bruce Rosenthal, a New York investment banker with Nathan S. Jonas & Co.
"Investors aren't going *-1 to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs, but *PRO* doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense, either."
Earlier this year, bankers and other investors were willing *PRO*-1 to provide financing because they assumed 0 there would be major gains in both profitability and sales, Mr. Rosenthal added 0 *T*-2.
Those days are over now, he believes 0 *T*-1.
"Competition from third parties who *T*-1 have cash and are prepared *PRO*-2 to buy has always existed and will continue," added *T*-3 Mr. Rosenthal.
"But when prices were crazy *T*-1, it was even harder *PRO* to do an LBO.
Bankers believed in the greater - fool theory that *T*-1 says 0 somebody else is always willing *PRO*-2 to pay more.
This is no longer true today."
At Saks Fifth Avenue, Paul Leblang, senior vice president, marketing, agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO.
"*PRO* Having *PRO*-1 to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage," said *T*-2 Mr. Leblang.
"It would also help us in our search for equity partners.
*PRO* To make an LBO work, now we are going *-1 to need more than just junk bonds.
" None believe 0 the proposed management LBOs will be easy *PRO* to complete *?*, especially at B. Altman & Co., which *T*-1 is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy, but potential junk - bond buyers are sure *-1 to demand even stronger covenants and greater management equity participation.
Further, many institutions today holding troubled retailers' debt securities will be reticent *PRO*-1 to consider additional retailing investments.
"It's called bad money driving out good money," said *T*-1 one retailing observer.
"Institutions that *T*-1 usually buy retail paper have *-2 to be more concerned."
However, the lower prices 0 these retail chains are now expected *-1 to bring *T*-2 should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt.
In addition, the fall selling season has generally been a good one, especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues.
"What *T*-2's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold *-1 on the basis of their sales and earnings, not liquidation values," said *T*-3 Joseph E. Brooks, chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc., a specialty chain.
"Retailers who *T*-1 had good track records of *PRO*-2 producing profits will have a better chance *PRO* to buy back their companies."
Still, most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds, a market already in tumult, in part because of concerns associated * with bonds issued * by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau.
"Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were *?* last week, which *T*-1 will help management," said *T*-2 Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., an investment - banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions.
"But the hurdle of financing still has *-2 to be resolved *-1.
Potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management, or insist 0 the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past.
UGI Corp. said 0 its AmeriGas subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in Waukesha, Wis., to AGA Gas Inc., Cleveland.
The price wasn't disclosed *-1.
The transaction is part of UGI's continuing program *PRO* to shed AmeriGas's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary's propane business.
Since June, AmeriGas has netted more than $100 million *U* from industrial gas divestitures and reinvested more than $50 million *U* *PRO*-1 to acquire three propane distributors.
UGI is a gas and electric utility and distributes propane nationally through its AmeriGas subsidiary.

CREATIVE ACCOUNTING, mostly by conglomerates, forced CPAs *PRO*-4 to change their way of *PRO* setting standards 0 *T*-3 to be followed *-1 by corporations reporting financial results, standards that *T*-2 had become all too flexible.
The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was created *-1 in 1972 *PRO*-1 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
All of the former board's members were CPAs, *PRO* provoking conflict - of - interest criticism because they were writing rules while *PRO*-1 handling clients' books at the same time.
The new board's seven - member structure kept four CPAs, but the others were from industry and academia.
Francis M. Wheat, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member, headed the panel that *T*-1 had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30, 1972.
The former board had produced "21 opinions and 1,000 critics" in its 12 - year life, its chairman had conceded 0 *T*-1.
The climate *ICH*-1 was right for the new FASB.
In the late 1960s some CPAs failed *-2 to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that *T*-1 hyped earnings and stock prices.
And in November 1970 Congress had passed a special act *PRO*-1 to overrule one board rule.
Also, James Needham, an SEC commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a "federal agency writing accounting rules" if they rejected the FASB idea.
Keepers of the books, dubbed *PRO* *PRO*-1 "figure filberts," loathed the threat.
The FASB had its initial meeting on March 28, 1973.
On Dec. 13, 1973, it issued its first rule; it required companies *PRO*-1 to disclose foreign currency translations in U.S. dollars.
The FASB since then has issued 102 rules, and some still rile industry.
Since late 1987, for example, it has put off a rule dealing with deferred income taxes because of the continuing controversy over the issue.
THE R.H. MACY & CO . department - store chain isn't for sale.
In yesterday's edition, it was incorrectly included *-1 with a list of New York chains up for sale.
The following issues *ICH*-3 were recently filed *-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Gehl Co., initial public offering of two million shares of common stock, of which 1,450,635 shares *T*-4 are being offered *-1 by the company and 549,365 shares *T*-4 by holders, via Blunt, Ellis & Loewi Inc. and Robert W. Baird & Co.
Giant Industries Inc., initial public offering of 3,111,000 common shares, of which 2,425,000 *T*-2 will be sold *-1 by the company, and the rest *T*-2 by holders, via Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Hanifen, Imhoff Inc.
Inefficient - Market Fund Inc., initial offering of five million common shares, via Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
Jason Overseas Ltd., initial offering of four million common shares, of which 3.2 million *T*-2 will be sold *-1 in the U.S., and the balance *T*-2 outside the U.S., via Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. and Mabon, Nugent & Co.
Debora Foster takes off her necklace, settles herself on a padded chair and gently leans forward.
With a jazz - piano tape playing softly in the background, the soothing hands of Sabina Vidunas begin *-1 to work on Ms. Foster's neck and shoulders.
"It's like an oasis in this room," Ms. Foster purrs *T*-1.
The room in question is the directors' lounge of H.J. Heinz Co., 60 floors above the bustle of Pittsburgh.
There, amid oil paintings and marble tables, massages are administered *-1 every Wednesday.
"On days that I'm really busy *T*-3," says *?* Ms. Foster, who *T*-2 works in public relations for the company, "it *EXP*-1 seems *-4 decadent *PRO* to take time off for a massage."
Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks, on - site massage, as it is known *-1 in the trade, is certainly infiltrating corporate America.
In some companies middle managers sneak massage therapists into the office, *PRO*-1 fearful that upper - level executives won't approve.
Ms. Foster's indulgence is nothing like the oily, hour - long rubfests enjoyed * by spa visitors.
Nor does it at all resemble (despite what some executives think *T*-1) the more intimate variety offered * at specialty parlors in bad parts of town.
On the contrary, office rubdowns usually take place in dimly lighted conference rooms, where stressed - out employees relax in specially designed chairs, *PRO*-1 fully clothed *T*-2.
The massages last 15 minutes and typically cost about $10 *U*.
Some companies, including Heinz, even pay part of the fee.
Ms. Vidunas has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started *-1 at Heinz last year.
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, the company's chairman, swears by her firm touch, *PRO*-1 saying 0 regular massages are a balm for his old football injuries.
Massage advocates say that *PRO* kneading the head, shoulders, neck and back can go a long way toward *PRO* easing tension and improving morale.
They also insist that touching is a basic need, as powerful as the need for food or sleep, and that the office is as good a place as any 0 *PRO* to do it *T*-1.
"The blood flows to your head, you feel lightheaded and you don't feel tension around the head or neck," says *T*-1 Minnie Morey, an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand Rapids, Mich., where massages began last month *T*-2.
"When you leave the room after your massage *T*-1, people say 0 you look like you're glowing."
Adds *ICH*-2 Candice Ohlman, the 35 - year - old masseuse who *T*-1 plies her trade in the Grand Rapids office, "They fall in love with my hands."
Not everyone, however, is at ease with office massage.
Three years ago, the Internal Revenue Service's office in San Jose, Calif., opened its doors to on - site massage.
And even though employees paid the bill, taxpayers grumbled.
"Sometimes, with the release of stress, you hear ` oohs' and ` ahs' coming out of the room," explains *T*-1 Morgan Banks, the agency's health specialist.
"And you can't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing ` oohs' and ` ahs."'
Last month, the complaints intensified and the massages ended.
"Now we're looking for a room with thicker walls," Ms. Banks says *T*-1.
Massage also has an image problem 0 *PRO* to contend with *T*-1.
Some masseurs have tried *PRO*-1 to get around this by *PRO* calling themselves "*PRO*-2 bodyworkers" and describing their office visits as "reinvigoration breaks."
But massage, no matter how chaste, is still associated *-1 in many minds with seedy fronts for prostitution, and that makes some executives nervous.
Last year, the research and development division of Weyerhaeuser Co., the large wood - products concern, invited a masseuse to its Tacoma, Wash., offices.
Phil Harms, a software engineer, was an eager customer.
"You build up a lot of tension *PRO*-1 working at a terminal all day," he says *T*-2.
But after about eight months, the vice president of the division, Ed Soule, learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt.
Mr. Soule says 0 his only beef was that the massages were being given *-1 in a company conference room; the department's supervised health facility would have been fine.
"In my view, {massages} should be managed *-2 with an appropriate mixture of males and females around," he says *T*-1.
Given such attitudes, some corporate masseurs prefer *PRO*-1 to go about their business quietly.
Russell Borner of Park Ridge, N.J., says 0 he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York--*PRO* unbeknownst to the company's executives.
He visits the same department every two or three weeks.
His massage chair is kept *-1 in a closet, and a secretary escorts him past security.
"This is common with a lot of large companies," says *T*-2 Mr. Borner, who *T*-1 worked for American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for 23 years before *PRO* choosing his current trade.
Managers, he contends 0 *?*, "are afraid how they're going *-2 to look in the eyes of their peers *T*-3.
My vision is *PRO* to change human consciousness towards touch.
My attitude is: *PRO* Let's come out of the closet."
Occasionally, all that *T*-1's needed *-2 is a little coaxing.
Elisa Byler, a St. Louis masseuse, won over officials at Emerson Electric Co., a maker of electrical and electronic equipment, by *PRO* providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage.
She notes that she also stresses professionalism during her weekly visits.
"I pull my hair back, wear a little makeup and look corporate," says *T*-2 Ms. Byler, who *T*-1 has been visiting Emerson since January.
"If I go in there as I normally dress, they'd ask, ` Who *T*-1 is this hippie?"'
The self - proclaimed father of on - site massage is David Palmer, a 41 - year - old San Francisco masseur whose mission *T*-1 is *PRO* to save the touch - starved masses.
*PRO*-1 To help do this, Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair *ICH*-3 three years ago that he hopes 0 *T*-2 will bring "structured touching" into mainstream America.
"The culture is not ready *PRO*-1 to take off its clothes, lie down and be touched *-2 for an hour for $45 *U*," he says *T*-3.
"The idea is *PRO* to keep the clothes *PRO*-1 on and *PRO* to keep people *PRO*-2 seated *-3.
The chair is a way 0 *PRO* to package massage *T*-1."
*PRO* Sitting in one of Mr. Palmer's chairs, which *T*-1 cost $425 *U* and have since been copied *-2 by others, is a bit like *PRO* straddling a recliner.
Customers lean forward, rest their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of the chair.
(Ms. Ohlman, the Grand Rapids masseuse, says 0 she has heard the odd - looking contraption compared *-1 to something out of the Spanish Inquisition.)
Mr. Palmer, who *T*-2 serves as president of the On - Site Massage Association and writes an industry newsletter, says 0 some 4,000 practitioners--out of about 50,000 certified masseurs across the country--now use massage chairs in the workplace, as well as on street corners, in airports and malls, and at conventions and other gatherings where weary people can be found *-1 *T*-3.
Scot MacInnis, a masseur in Boulder, Colo., had a scary experience while *PRO*-1 massaging a man in a natural - foods supermarket as part of a store promotion.
Three minutes into the massage, the man curled up, began *-1 shaking and turned red.
Paramedics were called *-1.
A week later, the man told Mr. MacInnis 0 he had suffered a mild heart attack unrelated to the massage.
"It was a powerful point in my career," says *T*-2 the 31 - year - old Mr. MacInnis, who *T*-1 has since taken out a $1 million *U* liability policy for his business.
"But he pulled through, and after the ambulance left, there were still six people in line waiting for a massage.
The next woman was older, and I was afraid *PRO*-1 to touch her.
But it's like *PRO* falling off a horse and getting back on *?*."
Despite the number of fans that office massage has won *T*-1, some purists look down on it, *PRO*-2 arguing that naked, full - body rubs are the only way 0 *PRO* to go *T*-3.
Linda Aldridge, who *T*-1 does full - body work in Pittsburgh, says that while on - site massage is better than nothing, tired workers should realize 0 it is only the tip of the iceberg.
"Whole areas of their bodies are neglected *-1," she says *T*-2, *PRO*-3 adding that clothes ruin the experience.
"There's nothing like skin to skin.
CAE Industries Ltd. said 0 its Link Flight Simulation division was awarded *-2 a contract *ICH*-1 by the U.S. Army for two helicopter simulators, which the company valued *T*-3 at as much as 37 million Canadian dollars (US$31.5 million *U*).
CAE said 0 the fixed price for the first of the AH - 64 Apache combat mission simulators is C$19 million *U*.
It is scheduled *-1 for delivery in late 1991.
The price of the second simulator ranges between C$16.4 million *U* and C$18 million *U*, CAE said 0 *?*, *PRO* depending on when the Army exercises its option *T*-2.
CAE is a Toronto - based maker of commercial and military aircraft simulators and training equipment.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans *PRO*-1 to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges, a move almost certain *PRO* to infuriate exchange officials and traders.
The CFTC said 0 it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that *T*-1 shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites "problems" associated * with the practice.
Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right 0 *T*-1 to trade both for his own account and for customers.
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
While *PRO*-2 not specifically mentioned *-1 in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts *PRO* to tighten industry regulations.
Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders.
Traders are likely *-1 to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way 0 *PRO* to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders *T*-2 *T*-3.
The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they don't have a customer order in hand *T*-1.
The exchanges say 0 liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration.
The CFTC may take those arguments into account by *PRO*-1 allowing exceptions to its restrictions.
The agency didn't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed *-1 *T*-3, but smaller exchanges or contracts that *T*-2 need additional liquidity are expected *-4 to be among them.
Wendy Gramm, the agency's chairman, told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released *-1 within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed *-2 by Thanksgiving.
The study, by the CFTC's division of economic analysis, shows that "a trade is a trade," a member of the study team said *T*-1.
Whether a trade is done *-1 on a dual or non-dual basis, the member said 0 *?*, "doesn't seem *PRO*-3 to have much economic impact."
Currently, most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts, which *T*-1 makes them brokers, or for their own accounts as socalled locals.
"The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity 0 they provide *T*-1 to the market," Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel *T*-2.
Members of Congress have proposed *PRO* restricting dual trading in bills 0 *T*-1 to reauthorize CFTC operations.
The House's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more, comprising those considered *PRO* too difficult 0 *PRO* to track *T*-1 without a sophisticated computer system.
